Write pseudocode to solve the described problem. Only provide the pseudocode itself—do not include any purpose, summary, overview, notes, or explanations. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language with concise, high-level instructions. Prefer one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Avoid comments or descriptive text. Follow the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode is compact and clear. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to produce the best possible result within this limit.
