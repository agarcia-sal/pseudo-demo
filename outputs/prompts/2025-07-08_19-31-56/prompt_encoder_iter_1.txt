Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a compact, high-level style with natural language, symbolic operators, abbreviations, and mostly one-liners. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow the numbered step format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second generation limit.
