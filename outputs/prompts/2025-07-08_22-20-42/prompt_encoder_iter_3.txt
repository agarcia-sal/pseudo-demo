Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the given problem description. Express the algorithm in clear, mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Use compact, high-level statements and prefer one-liners that capture the logic succinctly without losing clarity. Use meaningful yet brief variable names. Do not include any purpose, summary, explanations, comments, or extra formatting. Present only algorithmic steps as a numbered list in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separator lines or section headers. The pseudocode should stand alone as a minimal, complete outline of the solution.

Example of preferred style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
