Generate concise, high-level pseudocode directly from the problem description, using clear natural language integrated with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand, compact while fully capturing the algorithmic logic, avoiding detailed explanations, summaries, comments, or notes. Use mostly one-line steps; nested structures can use consistent indentation but keep blocks minimal and focused. Use brief, meaningful variable names prioritizing clarity and brevity. Present the output as an enumerated list in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid all extra formatting such as separator lines or verbose constructs. The pseudocode should stand alone as a minimal but complete algorithm outline.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
