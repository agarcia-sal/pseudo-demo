Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Do not include any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Use compact, high-level natural language with one-liners, symbolic forms, and abbreviations as appropriate. Avoid comments or explanations. Follow a numbered step format, for example:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity while ensuring the logic is straightforward and understandable. Your pseudocode should focus solely on the algorithmic steps.
