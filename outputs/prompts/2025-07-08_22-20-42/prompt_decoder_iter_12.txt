Translate the following pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that strictly adheres to these requirements:

- Read all inputs using `input()` with no prompt strings.
- Produce output exactly as described by the pseudocode; do not add any extra or debug text.
- Implement the logic precisely as given, preserving the intended behavior and edge case handling.
- Optimize for clarity, correctness, and runtime performance within a 5-second execution limit on typical inputs.
- Import and use any standard Python libraries as needed to simplify or speed up your solution.
- Avoid unnecessary comments; include minimal comments only if they substantially enhance understanding of complex logic.
- Enclose your entire solution within a single Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# your code here
```

Here is the pseudocode:
