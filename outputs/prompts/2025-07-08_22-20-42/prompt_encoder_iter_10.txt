Generate concise, high-level pseudocode directly from the given problem description. Use clear natural language blended with symbolic forms and common abbreviations to keep it compact and readable. Output only the exact algorithmic steps—no purpose, overview, explanations, comments, or clarifications. Express logic primarily in one-liners, using conditions and iterations in minimal form. Use meaningful yet brief variable names. Format the pseudocode as a numbered list, following this pattern exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid extra formatting, separators, or lines. The pseudocode should stand alone as a complete, minimal algorithm outline capturing the core logic. For example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
