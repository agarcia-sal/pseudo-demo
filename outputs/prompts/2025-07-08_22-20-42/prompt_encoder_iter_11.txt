Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the problem description. Use primarily natural language with symbolic forms and common abbreviations to achieve high-level, compact steps. Output only the algorithmic instructions as a numbered list, each preferably a one-liner or minimal nested structure, strictly without any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes. Use meaningful but brief variable names. Adopt the exact format below, avoiding extra separators or formatting:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure pseudocode stands alone as a complete yet minimal algorithm outline.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
