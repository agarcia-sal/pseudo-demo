Translate the following pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code. Your implementation must:

- Use only `input()` for inputs (no prompts inside `input()`).
- Produce output exactly as implied by the pseudocode (no extra text).
- Complete execution within 5 seconds on typical test inputs.
- Import and use any standard Python libraries if helpful to optimize clarity, correctness, or performance.
- Ensure your code is robust, handles edge cases naturally, and closely follows the provided pseudocode logic.
- Include no comment lines unless absolutely necessary for code clarity.
- Output only the code enclosed within a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# your code here
```

Here is the pseudocode:
