Generate clear, concise pseudocode from the given problem description, emphasizing readability and simplicity. Use mostly natural language with occasional symbolic expressions and standard abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Present only essential algorithmic steps—no explanations, comments, or summaries. Prefer one-liners and brief control constructs, including inline conditions when suitable. Output the pseudocode exactly as a numbered list in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use meaningful but brief variable names. Reflect common programming idioms compactly (e.g., "for i = 0 to n-1", "if x > y: swap x, y"). Avoid decorative separators or extra formatting. The pseudocode should be a minimal, standalone algorithm outline.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i = 0 to size of A exclusive  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
