Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, optimized, and well-structured Python code that strictly follows the given algorithmic logic. Your implementation should be efficient enough to run within 5 seconds for typical inputs. Use only plain `input()` for reading inputs where necessary (no prompting strings). Include no extraneous output, comments, or explanations unless absolutely necessary for clarity. 

Output the entire solution inside a single Python code block formatted as:
```python
# your code here
```

You may freely use any standard Python libraries to enhance performance and clarity, but ensure the code remains readable and straightforward. Focus on correctness, efficiency, and concise adherence to the pseudocodeâ€™s intent.
