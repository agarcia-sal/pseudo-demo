Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the given problem description. Use clear but compact natural language mixed with symbolic forms and abbreviations. Present only the algorithmic steps with no purpose, summary, explanations, comments, or notes. Prefer one-liners and high-level expressions that capture logic clearly yet succinctly. Output the pseudocode as a numbered step list with this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use meaningful variable names but favor brevity and clarity. Avoid separators or extra formatting. The pseudocode should stand alone as a minimal but complete algorithm outline. For example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
