Translate the given pseudocode into concise, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that strictly preserves all original function names and control flow.  
Use Pythonâ€™s standard library and any built-in functions or modules as needed to maximize clarity, performance, and correctness, ensuring your solution runs within 5 seconds on typical inputs.  
Omit comments, debug prints, and any extraneous formatting; provide only the minimal working implementation.  
Do not alter the logic or function names from the pseudocode.  
Enclose **all** your code **only** in a Python code block formatted exactly as below:

```python
# Your translated code here
