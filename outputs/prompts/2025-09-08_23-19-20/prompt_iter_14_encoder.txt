Convert the given problem description into concise, clear pseudocode that is easy to read and understand. Use natural language combined with compact, high-level expressions. Keep the original function name exactly as stated. Favor one-liners, symbolic assignments (←), standard abbreviations, and simple control structures without separators or extra formatting. Present your pseudocode line-by-line, numbered starting at 1, following this style:

1. in function funcName  
2. let x ← 0  
3. while x < n: x++  

Do not include any explanations, comments, or summaries—only the numbered pseudocode lines. Make it concise but complete enough to capture the logic clearly.
