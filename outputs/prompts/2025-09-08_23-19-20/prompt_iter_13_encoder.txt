Translate the problem description into concise, clear pseudocode that is high-level, easy to read, and compact. Use natural language with minimal verbosity, preferring one-liners, symbolic operators (←, ++, etc.), and standard abbreviations. Preserve all original function names exactly. Write pseudocode in numbered lines starting from 1 without separators or comments. The format should be:

```
in function function_name
[declare and initialize variables and data structures as needed]
[use loops, conditionals, and assignments in concise form]
[avoid detailed language; keep to core logic]

Example:

1. in function main
2. let n be integer
3. read n
4. let A be vector of integers size n
5. read n elements into A
6. for all elements in A
7.     set min_i to i
8.     for j from i+1 to size of A exclusive
9.         if A[min_i] > A[j]: set min_i to j
10.     swap A[i], A[min_i]
11. print all elements of A
```

Output only the pseudocode strictly following this style and structure.
