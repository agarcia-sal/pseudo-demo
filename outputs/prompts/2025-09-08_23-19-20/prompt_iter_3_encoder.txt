Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode that directly implements the solution described in the problem. The pseudocode must:

- Use the exact function names as in the original code.
- Be compact and high-level, mixing natural language with symbolic operators and abbreviations.
- Avoid any explanations, summaries, comments, or notes; output only the pseudocode.
- Prefer one-line statements where possible, and use numbered lines formatted as follows:

  1. x ← 0  
  2. while x < n: x++

- Use consistent, simple variable names and succinct control structures.
- Express data structures and operations in natural yet precise terms (e.g., "let A be array of integers", "for i from 0 to n-1").
- Avoid separator lines or extraneous formatting.
- Strive for minimal line count while maintaining full clarity and correctness.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be array of integers of size n  
for i from 0 to n-1: read A[i]  
for i from 0 to n-2:  
 set min_i to i  
 for j from i+1 to n-1: if A[j] < A[min_i]: min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
