Translate the given pseudocode into concise, idiomatic, and efficient Python 3 code that exactly matches the logic and structure of the pseudocode, preserving all function names and parameters verbatim.  
Utilize any suitable modules from Python’s standard library or built-in functions to optimize clarity, performance, and correctness without altering the original algorithmic behavior.  
Your implementation must be production-ready: free of comments, debug prints, unnecessary whitespace, or extraneous formatting—output only the minimal fully executable code.  
If multiple functions are described, include all in the output fully and accurately, maintaining their order.  
Assume inputs strictly conform to the pseudocode’s implied types and structures.  
Do not simplify logic in a way that changes behavior or outputs.  
The code must run efficiently within 5 seconds on typical input sizes.  
Do not add any text, explanation, or separators outside the code block.  
Enclose all your output strictly within a single Python code block as shown:

```python
