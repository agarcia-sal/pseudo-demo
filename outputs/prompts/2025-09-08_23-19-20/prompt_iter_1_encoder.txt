Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode representing the solution to the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, or explanatory notes. Avoid comments. Format steps as numbered lines, prefer one-liners where possible, for example:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Focus solely on the pseudocode logic, making it clear and understandable within a 5-second generation time.
