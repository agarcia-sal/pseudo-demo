```
You are given a complete pseudocode snippet intended to implement a specified algorithm or solve a well-defined problem via a clearly named class and method(s). Your task is to determine **with absolute certainty** whether this pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, defined as being directly translatable into a working implementation guaranteed to pass **all valid unit tests** targeting the described interface and functionality.

Produce output exactly one character — `1` if reproducible, `0` otherwise — strictly following these rigorous conditions:

---

1. **Exact Interface and Structural Fidelity**  
 - The pseudocode declares a class and its methods to be implemented, exactly matching the prescribed interface by name and parameter signatures as assumed by tests and external calls.  
 - Entry point method(s) must be fully specified, uniquely identifiable, and not hidden or ambiguous.  
 - All identifiers (functions, variables, classes) used are properly declared, consistently named, and legally scoped with no implicit or missing definitions.  
 - No usage of undefined or ambiguous references (e.g., implicit globals, undeclared parameters, or mismatched naming) is permitted.

2. **Complete and Unambiguous Procedural Logic**  
 - Every step of the algorithm is fully detailed. Initialization, variable assignments, loops, conditional branches, recursion, and returns are expressed clearly without vagueness or incomplete descriptions.  
 - Control flow is logically coherent and terminates properly: no infinite loops without exit conditions, no unreachable code, and no missing branches for any conditional or loop.  
 - All logical operations and conditions precisely describe handling of all relevant input scenarios, including typical cases, edge cases, and exceptional conditions, either by explicit handling or clear justification of safe omission.

3. **Explicit and Implementable Data Management**  
 - All data structures (arrays, lists, dictionaries, sets, stacks, queues, etc.) have well-defined types, sizes, and indexing conventions stated explicitly or unambiguously inferable without guesswork.  
 - Indexing and access operations respect boundaries strictly (no out-of-range, off-by-one, or ambiguous index bases).  
 - Data manipulations avoid undefined states: no use of uninitialized variables, no hidden side effects, no ambiguous mutations, and no reliance on external states not explicitly modeled in the pseudocode.

4. **Standardized, Unambiguous, and Implementation-Ready Notation**  
 - The pseudocode notation uses conventional programming constructs and expressions that map clearly and directly to typical programming language implementations.  
 - Operators, control structures, function calls, and expressions are clearly defined or standard, with no invented or inconsistent syntax or semantics.  
 - Any domain-specific or language-like abstractions must be completely specified to avoid ambiguity or guesswork.

5. **Self-Contained and Test-Compatible**  
 - All auxiliary or helper functions/methods referenced are fully declared and defined in the same pseudocode snippet with clear accessibility and scope.  
 - No references to external definitions, libraries, or partial implementations are present.  
 - The resulting pseudocode is self-contained and directly executable by translation without additional assumptions or supplementation.

Evaluate the entire pseudocode holistically against all these criteria. Output:

`1`

if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** conditions fully and unambiguously, guaranteeing that a direct implementation will pass **every unit test** for the described functionality.

Output:

`0`

if **any** condition is violated, ambiguous, incomplete, or deficient in a way that prevents guaranteed reproducibility and perfect test passing.

**Strict output rules:** output exactly one character (`1` or `0`) per input pseudocode snippet, with no extra spaces, explanations, or formatting.
