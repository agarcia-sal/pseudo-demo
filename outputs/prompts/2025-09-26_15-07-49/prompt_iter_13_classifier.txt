Given a pseudocode snippet intended as a complete, implementable solution for a specified programming interface, determine if this pseudocode is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be **directly and unambiguously converted into working code that will pass all relevant unit tests without any modifications**.

Perform a rigorous, itemized evaluation based solely on the pseudocode content and structure. Only output `1` if **every** aspect listed below is satisfied unequivocally; otherwise, output `0`. Output exactly one character (`1` or `0`) per input pseudocode, no explanations or extra text.

---

### Evaluation criteria for reproducibility:

1. **Complete and Exact Interface Specification**  
 - All required functions, methods, or classes exist and have **exact names and parameter lists** exactly matching the expected test harness.  
 - The primary entry point (e.g., main class and method) is clearly defined.  
 - There are no missing functions or auxiliary definitions referenced but not provided.

2. **Variable and Data Declaration Clarity**  
 - All variables, parameters, and data structures are declared or clearly introduced with valid, legal scopes.  
 - No use of undeclared variables, ambiguous identifiers, or implicit globals.  

3. **Precise and Disambiguated Logic Flow**  
 - Every control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion) is explicitly and unambiguously described, including all loop bounds, conditions, and termination criteria.  
 - Execution flow contains no unreachable code, conflicting conditions, or incomplete branches.  
 - Handling of edge cases, boundary conditions, and all relevant input scenarios is explicitly specified or logically covered.  
 - No unstated assumptions about inputs or environment.

4. **Explicit Data Structure and Operation Definitions**  
 - All data structures are fully specified with respect to types, sizes, index bases, and allowed operations—either explicitly or in clear, inferrable detail.  
 - Indexing and access patterns are always safe, within bounds, and clearly indicated.  
 - No hidden side effects or undefined operations.

5. **Standardized, Implementation-Ready Notation**  
 - The pseudocode uses conventional constructs clearly and consistently, avoiding invented, ambiguous, or conflicting syntax.  
 - Operators and expressions are standard or clearly defined to map straightforwardly to commonly used programming languages.  

6. **Conformance to Input/Output and Naming Conventions**  
 - Function/method signatures align in name, order, and type with what automated tests expect.  
 - Return values and output formats match test expectations exactly.  
 - Any helper methods are properly nested or exposed per interface requirements.

7. **Self-Contained & Independently Executable Design**  
 - No external dependencies, undefined references, or unstated requirements beyond the provided pseudocode.  
 - The pseudocode should stand alone as a full solution.

If **all** these criteria are met completely and without ambiguity or omission, **output:**

```
1
```

Otherwise, if **any** criterion fails—due to missing/incorrect interface, ambiguous or incomplete logic, undeclared identifiers, incorrect or unsafe data usage, or any other factor preventing guaranteed passing of all valid unit tests—**output:**

```
0
```

---

**Output format:**  
Only output a single character `1` or `0` (no spaces, newlines besides the single final output character).  
If multiple pseudocodes are fed sequentially, output corresponding digits in the same order, one per pseudocode.

This prompt explicitly requires a meticulous, comprehensive verification that aligns exactly with test interface expectations and implementation feasibility, minimizing false negatives and false positives. It disallows any tolerance for implicit assumptions or ambiguous expressions, demanding absolute confidence the pseudocode translates to fully passing code.
