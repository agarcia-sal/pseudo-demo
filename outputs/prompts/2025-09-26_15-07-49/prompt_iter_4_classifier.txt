Given the pseudocode below, determine **with absolute certainty** whether it is reproducible — that is, whether it provides a complete, explicit, and unambiguous specification sufficient to implement a fully correct and logically coherent program that will pass all unit tests for all valid inputs. To decide, rigorously evaluate the pseudocode against these dimensions:

1. **Structural completeness:** All classes, functions, parameters, variables, and data structures must be clearly declared or explicitly evident, including their scopes and types (either stated or inferable unambiguously). No undefined references or missing components.

2. **Logic clarity and coverage:** The algorithmic steps must be detailed explicitly, covering normal operation, edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional cases—no gaps, implicit assumptions, or omissions that could cause ambiguity or failure.

3. **Control flow soundness:** Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) must be well-formed, correctly bounded, and exhaustively handle all possible paths without contradiction or infinite regress.

4. **Naming, indexing, and referencing correctness:** Variable and function names must be consistent and correct; indexing and access of data must be properly specified without out-of-bounds or ambiguous usages.

5. **Expressiveness limitations:** The pseudocode must adhere to standard, commonly accepted programming constructs such that it can be straightforwardly translated into executable code without requiring hidden knowledge or language-specific features beyond those implied.

6. **Return values and outputs:** Outputs and return values must be clearly and correctly defined, matching the intended semantics.

If and only if the pseudocode entirely meets all the above criteria so that a correct implementation can be derived that will pass all unit tests without fail, output **1**.

Otherwise, output **0**.

**Important:**  
- Output exactly one digit (**1** or **0**) per pseudocode input, corresponding to its order.  
- Do not output any explanations, comments, formatting, or extra text—only the single digit.
