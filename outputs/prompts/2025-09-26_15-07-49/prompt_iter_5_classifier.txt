Given the pseudocode below, determine if it is fully and unambiguously specified to enable a direct, error-free, and logically consistent implementation that will pass **all** unit tests for any valid input without assumptions or external dependencies. Your evaluation must ensure:

- All necessary components (classes, functions/methods, parameters, variables, constants, data structures) are explicitly declared or clearly and unambiguously inferable, with appropriate scopes and types.
- The logic covers **every** relevant scenario including normal execution, boundary conditions, and error or exceptional cases, with no gaps or missing steps.
- Control flow is complete and deterministic, handling all possible execution paths without ambiguity or contradictions.
- There is no reliance on unstated assumptions, implicit initializations, or undefined references that would cause runtime errors or logical failures.
- Consistent, valid use of naming, indexing, and data access to prevent any out-of-bound, undefined, or mis-scoped operations.
- The pseudocode adheres to standard programming constructs and conventions, allowing straightforward translation to a working implementation without needing guesswork.

After this comprehensive analysis, output exactly one digit:

- Output **1** if the pseudocode meets all the above criteria and is reproducible (guaranteed to pass all unit tests).
- Output **0** otherwise.

**Only output a single digit (1 or 0) per input, in the same order as the pseudocodes are provided, with no additional text, formatting, or explanation.**
