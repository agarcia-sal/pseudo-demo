Given a snippet of pseudocode, determine with absolute certainty whether it fully and explicitly specifies all necessary components and logic to produce a correct, unambiguous, and executable implementation that passes every relevant unit test without fail. Your assessment must verify all of the following in detail:

- Presence of a clear structural framework (e.g., classes/functions/methods) including correct declarations of all identifiers (variables, parameters, data structures) with their scope and data types either explicitly stated or unequivocally inferable.
- Complete specification of algorithmic logic covering initialization, iterations, conditional branches, and return statements, addressing all standard, edge, and error scenarios explicitly.
- Definitive control flow ensuring no undefined or unreachable paths, loops with clear bounds, and all recursive or iterative calls properly defined.
- Absence of any assumptions, implicit states, or uninitialized references that might cause logical errors or runtime failures.
- Consistent and error-free referencing, indexing, and naming conventions (including handling of zero- or one-based indices) that guarantee direct translatability into executable code.
- Compliance with conventional programming constructs and notation suitable for straightforward implementation without guesswork.

After a meticulous inspection against these criteria, output **1** if the pseudocode guarantees reproducibilityâ€”i.e., it can be implemented faithfully and will pass all valid unit tests for the described functionality. Otherwise, output **0**.

**Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) per pseudocode input, nothing else (no explanations, comments, formatting, or whitespace).**
