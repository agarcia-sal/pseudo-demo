Given a pseudocode that fully describes a program implementing a specified interface, determine **with absolute certainty** whether it is **reproducible**â€”meaning it can be translated directly into working code that will pass **all valid unit tests** for that interface. The output must be either `1` if reproducible or `0` otherwise. Produce **exactly one character per pseudocode input, no explanations, no extra text.**

To decide reproducibility, perform a rigorous, exhaustive verification applying these principles:

---

### 1. Interface Correctness and Naming Precision  
- The pseudocode defines the required top-level class, object, or module with the **exact expected name**.  
- The main method/function must be declared with the **precise expected name and parameter list** as required by tests (including parameter names and arity).  
- All auxiliary subroutines or helpers called anywhere are fully defined within scope, correctly named, and accessible.  
- No partial or missing definitions, and no alternative or shadowed methods that conflict with the expected API.  

### 2. Semantic and Logical Completeness  
- Every statement and operation is unambiguously described, leaving no holes, contradictory conditions, or potential undefined branches.  
- Control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion) are clearly and fully specified, including termination criteria.  
- The pseudocode explicitly covers all relevant input cases, including edge and corner cases, or clearly documents safe default/fallback behavior without ambiguity.  
- Variables are properly declared before use. No unknown or undeclared variables or data are referenced anywhere.  

### 3. Data Structure and State Integrity  
- Data structures and types are explicitly or unambiguously detailed (e.g., lists, dictionaries, primitives) with their dimensions, base indices, and element types clearly stated or inferable without guesswork.  
- All indexing respects bounds and conventions; no out-of-range or ambiguous indices or accesses.  
- Data mutations are fully traceable, with no hidden side effects or state changes that cannot be straightforwardly implemented.  
- No reliance on unspecified globals, external state, or IO beyond the defined interface.  

### 4. Standardized and Translatable Syntax  
- Notation and keywords conform to common pseudocode conventions easily mappable to real code (e.g., standard keywords for loops, conditionals, assignments).  
- Operators and expressions (arithmetic, logical, bitwise, function calls) are clearly defined or standard, unambiguous, and implementable in conventional languages.  
- No invented symbols, shorthand, or ambiguous constructs that cannot be reliably translated.  

### 5. Clarity on Input/Output and Return Values  
- Return statements and output conventions are clearly specified to exactly match the expected output signature and data types.  
- The initial call interface matches what unit tests will invoke, including parameter passing and return structure.  

---

**Decision:**  
- Output `1` **only if every one of these criteria is fully satisfied with zero ambiguity or omissions.**  
- Output `0` if **any** violation, ambiguity, incomplete detail, or mismatch that could prevent passing all valid unit tests exists.  

---

**Strict output format:**  
Output exactly one character: `1` or `0`  
No spaces, no newlines, no explanations, no additional text.

This prompt demands a holistic, exacting, and exhaustive semantic and structural evaluation of the pseudocode, ensuring guaranteed direct reproducibility for perfect passing of all unit tests. The output sequence must strictly correspond, one-to-one, with the order of pseudocodes given as input.
