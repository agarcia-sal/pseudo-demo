Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a compact, high-level style with natural language, one-liners, symbolic forms, and abbreviations. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this numbered step format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure clarity and readability while keeping the pseudocode brief. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best result within this limit.
