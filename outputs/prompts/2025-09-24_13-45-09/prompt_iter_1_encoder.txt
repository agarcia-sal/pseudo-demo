Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations in a compact, high-level style. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, notes, comments, or explanationsâ€”only the pseudocode itself. Prefer one-liners where possible, avoid verbose constructs, and structure the pseudocode for clarity and brevity. Your output should focus solely on the algorithm steps clearly and efficiently within a 5-second runtime.
