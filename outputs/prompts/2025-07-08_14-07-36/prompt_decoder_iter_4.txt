Translate the following pseudocode into concise, idiomatic, and efficient Python code. Your solution must:

- Be fully contained within a single Python code block formatted exactly as:
  ```python
  # Your translated code here
  ```
- Read input from standard input using `input()` without any prompt strings.
- Not include any separator or comment lines unrelated to code clarity.
- Prioritize correctness, readability, and optimal performance within a 5-second runtime constraint.
- Utilize any standard Python libraries or packages if they help improve clarity or efficiency.
- Include necessary handling to accurately reflect the logic of the pseudocode while avoiding assumptions beyond what is given.

Provide the complete runnable code onlyâ€”no explanations or additional text.
