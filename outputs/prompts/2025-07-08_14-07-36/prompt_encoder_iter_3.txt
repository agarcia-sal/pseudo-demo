Write concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description, using clear natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations to make it compact and easy to read. Present only the pseudocode—without any explanations, summaries, comments, or purpose statements. Use mostly one-line instructions that directly express the algorithm’s logic. Number each line consecutively as shown below:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Favor straightforward constructs, using terms like “let,” “set,” “read,” “print,” “for,” “if,” “while,” and concise variable names. Use indentation for nested blocks but keep the overall code brief and high-level. For example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers of size n  
read n elements into A  
for i = 0 to n-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j = i+1 to n-1  
  set min_i ← j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
