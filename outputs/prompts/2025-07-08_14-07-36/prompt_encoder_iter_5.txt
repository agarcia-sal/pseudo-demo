Write concise pseudocode for the given problem description only.  
- Produce clear, compact, high-level steps expressed in natural language using symbolic notation and common abbreviations.  
- Prefer one-liners and terse constructs without comments, explanations, notes, or summaries.  
- Number each line sequentially followed by a period, a space, then the statement, e.g.:  
  1. i ‚Üê 0  
  2. while i < n: i++  
- Use meaningful variable names but allow standard short names and symbols where clear.  
- Structure control flow simply and directly (e.g., if, for, while) without verbose syntax.  
- Omit separator lines or extra formatting.  
- Output only pseudocode reflecting the core algorithm logic clearly and succinctly, suitable for completion within 5 seconds.
