Write clear, compact, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural, easy-to-understand language while keeping it concise and precise. Express the core algorithmic logic only—do not include any purpose statements, summaries, comments, explanations, or clarifications. Use one-line statements whenever possible, employing symbolic notation and common abbreviations to maintain brevity. Format the pseudocode strictly as numbered steps:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separator lines or any extraneous formatting. The output should be solely the pseudocode, following this style exactly. Prioritize readability and completeness within a 5-second generation limit.
