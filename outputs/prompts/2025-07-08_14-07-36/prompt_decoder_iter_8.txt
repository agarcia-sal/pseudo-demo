Translate the given pseudocode into a clean, efficient, and fully runnable Python program, strictly adhering to these rules:

- Enclose your entire submission in a single Python code block formatted exactly as:
  ```python
  # Your complete Python code here
  ```
- Read all input exclusively using plain `input()` calls without any prompt strings.
- Output results exactly as required using only `print()`.
- Preserve the logic and flow of the pseudocode precisely, with no deviations.
- Write idiomatic, concise, and optimized Python code suitable for immediate execution.
- Use any Python standard library or publicly available third-party packages if they improve correctness, clarity, or performance.
- Do not add comments, debugging statements, explanatory text, or any extra output.
- Ensure the solution is performant and terminates within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Avoid any unnecessary formatting, separators, or extraneous characters in inputs or outputs.

Focus exclusively on a direct, minimal-transformation translation that produces a ready-to-run script perfectly aligned with the pseudocodeâ€™s intent and structure.
