Write pseudocode for the given problem description. Do not include a purpose, summary, or overview—only provide the pseudocode itself. Make the pseudocode easy to read and understand by using natural language, keeping it compact and high-level. Use concise lines, prefer one-liners, symbolic notation, and abbreviations where suitable. Avoid comments or explanations. Format each step with a line number and a statement, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should clearly express the algorithm's logic in a straightforward manner within a 5-second timeout, aiming for the best possible result.
