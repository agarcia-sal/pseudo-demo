Translate the given pseudocode into a concise, well-structured, and fully functional Python script. Your translation must:

- Be enclosed in a single Python code block as shown below:
  ```python
  # Your fully working Python code here
  ```
- Handle all input(s) strictly via `input()` without any prompts or messages.
- Produce output(s) exactly as expected, using only `print()` statements.
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and efficiency.
- Use appropriate Python standard libraries or third-party packages if they improve readability or performance.
- Avoid unnecessary comments or extra text.
- Complete execution logically within 5 seconds.

Focus solely on directly and accurately converting the pseudocodeâ€™s logic into runnable, idiomatic Python code suitable for immediate execution and testing.
