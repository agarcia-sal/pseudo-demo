Analyze the given pseudocode carefully and decide if it is fully executable as-is, without any missing details, errors, ambiguities, or omissions, such that it can be implemented exactly and pass **all** corresponding unit tests reliably and completely. 

Your evaluation must explicitly consider:

- Complete and correct definition of all required functions or methods, including proper naming consistent throughout.
- Clear, coherent, and unambiguous specification of inputs, outputs, data structures, and control flow.
- Inclusion of necessary initialization steps, boundary checks, and edge case handling.
- Logical correctness and completeness of all algorithmic steps for all valid inputs.
- Absence of contradictions, undeclared variables, or syntactic/semantic flaws that would prevent correct execution.

Output exactly one digit:  
- `1` if and only if the pseudocode as given can be directly translated into a working implementation that **passes all unit tests without any modification** (i.e., truly reproducible).  
- `0` otherwise (any ambiguity, incompleteness, error, or missing element makes it not reproducible).  

Return strictly a single character: `1` or `0`, with no additional text, explanation, or formatting.

The order of these single characters must correspond to the order in which multiple pseudocodes are fed into the prompt.

**Note:** Your judgment should be holistic and rigorous, treating the pseudocode as a specification that must be directly executable. Partial or near-correct algorithms, missing function definitions, or pseudocode lacking class/function wrappers or inconsistent naming must yield `0`. Only fully self-contained, logically sound, comprehensive, and unambiguous pseudocode that guarantees successful passing of all hidden unit tests earn `1`.
