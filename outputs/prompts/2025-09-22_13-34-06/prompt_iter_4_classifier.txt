Evaluate the given pseudocode to determine if it is fully defined, unambiguous, and logically complete such that it can be directly implemented and pass all relevant unit tests without modification. Consider if all inputs, processes, control flows, and outputs are clearly specified and coherent. Output 1 if the pseudocode meets these criteria (i.e., reproducible), otherwise output 0. Return only the single digit 1 or 0, nothing else.
