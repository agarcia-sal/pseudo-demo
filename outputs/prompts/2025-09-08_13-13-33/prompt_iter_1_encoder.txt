Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode using natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. The pseudocode should be high-level and compact, preferably one-liners, avoiding comments, explanations, purposes, summaries, or overview statements. Follow the format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include notes for clarity. Return only the pseudocode. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim for the best result within this limit.
