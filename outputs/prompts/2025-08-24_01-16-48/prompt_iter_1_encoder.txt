Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that uses natural language mixed with symbolic notation. The pseudocode should be compact, high-level, and preferably use one-liners, abbreviations, and symbolic operators. Do NOT include any purpose, summary, overview statements, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within the 5-second output limit.
