Given a clear problem description, generate concise, compact pseudocode that is easy to read and understand by blending natural language with symbolic notation. The pseudocode should be high-level, mostly one-liners, use standard abbreviations, symbolic operators (←, =, <, >, ≤, ≥, ≠, ∈, +, -, *, /, %, ++, --), and minimal punctuation. Avoid explanatory comments, summaries, or purpose statements—output only the pseudocode itself.

Structure steps as numbered lines starting from 1, following this form:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Favor clarity and brevity without sacrificing readability; use short variable names and natural phrasing (e.g., "for i in 0..n-1", "if x = y then", "return res"). Use indentation only when necessary for multi-step blocks, otherwise keep single-line branches concise with semicolons or commas to separate commands. Do not use horizontal separators or markdown formatting.

Example style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers with size n  
for i in 0..n-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j in i+1..n-1: set min_i ← j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A

Your output must fit within 5 seconds and produce clear, succinct pseudocode suitable for quick comprehension and algorithmic translation.
