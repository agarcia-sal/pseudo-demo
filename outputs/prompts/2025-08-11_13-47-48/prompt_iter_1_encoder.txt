Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Do not include any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Avoid notes or explanations; only provide the pseudocode itself. Use natural language in a compact, high-level style with one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Format steps with numbered lines, for example:  
1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Ensure pseudocode is clear and understandable. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for best output within this limit.
