Translate the following pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and optimal Python 3 code. Follow these strict guidelines exactly:

- Enclose the entire code only inside one contiguous Python code block using triple backticks and the language tag ```python ... ```
- The code must read inputs using plain `input()` calls without any prompt strings.
- Use only standard Python 3 libraries or packages; imports are allowed if they improve clarity or performance.
- Prioritize correctness, readability, and efficiency so the code executes within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Do not include any comments, explanations, extra print statements, or separators.
- Reflect all logic from the pseudocode precisely in Python syntax, handling edge cases as needed.
- Output only the code block with the final codeâ€”no additional text or formatting.

Here is the pseudocode:
