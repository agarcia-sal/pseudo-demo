Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the provided problem description. The pseudocode should be compact, high-level, and use natural language enriched with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Provide only the pseudocode—no summaries, explanations, comments, or notes. Structure steps as numbered lines in the following style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for brevity using one-liners where possible, and express control flow and operations succinctly without losing clarity. Avoid any separator lines or extra formatting. The output should look like this style example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A  

Optimize for maximum completeness and clarity within a 5-second generation limit.
