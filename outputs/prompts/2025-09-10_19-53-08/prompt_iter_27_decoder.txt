Translate the given pseudocode into complete, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that exactly preserves all class names, method names, and signatures as specified in the pseudocode, including the precise object-oriented design and API.

Your output must:

- Accept all complex data structure inputs (e.g., binary trees, linked lists, graphs) **only as Python lists** where missing or null elements are strictly represented by Python’s `None`. Inputs will never use `null` or other non-Python tokens.
- Include **all imports, data structure class definitions, helper functions, and the solution class with its methods in one single, self-contained Python code block**, using ```python ... ``` delimiters. No additional text or explanations outside the code block.
- Internally implement robust, reusable, and well-encapsulated helper functions **inside the same code block**, capable of converting input lists into their proper Python data structures (e.g., build binary trees level-by-level using breadth-first traversal, build singly linked lists sequentially). These builders must correctly handle:
  - Empty or `None` inputs,
  - `None` values interspersed anywhere in input lists indicating missing nodes,
  - Edge cases like all `None` inputs or single-node inputs.
- Guarantee that **all solution methods operate strictly on the correctly instantiated data structure objects**, never on raw input lists.
- Use explicit and meaningful variable names that closely map to the pseudocode’s semantics—avoid ambiguous or generic names.
- Include **all necessary imports explicitly** (standard libraries preferred; third-party libraries only if indispensable and commonly accepted, e.g., `collections`) so the code is immediately runnable.
- Preserve the **exact order and names of classes, methods, and function signatures** as in the pseudocode—do not rename or reorder.
- For binary tree inputs: ensure your builder processes nodes level-by-level, correctly assigns `None` children per input, and prevents any attribute errors during traversal.
- For linked list inputs: ensure your builder respects `None` as missing nodes, and correctly links all nodes sequentially.
- For any additional complex data types implied by the pseudocode (e.g., graphs), design similar clear conversion helpers with careful null/empty handling.
- Avoid any usage or reference to non-Python `null` tokens; allow only Python’s `None`.
- Ensure the final code is free of runtime errors (such as attribute errors), robust for all edge cases, optimized for efficiency, and ready to execute without modification or extra setup.
- **Output only one single, clean, complete Python code block** matching the above conditions with no comments, explanations, or separator lines; your response must be precisely one Python block containing the full solution.
