Translate the given pseudocode into complete, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that exactly preserves the logic, all class names, method signatures, and object-oriented structure as specified. Your output must:

- Accept inputs that may represent trees, linked lists, or similar data structures as Python lists using `None` (not `null` or other tokens).  
- Provide internally defined, robust, and reusable helper functions or classes within the output code that convert such lists into their proper data structures (e.g., binary trees, singly linked lists) before passing them to the main solution methods. These builders must correctly handle missing/null nodes and edge cases.  
- In the main solution methods, always operate on the proper data structure objects (not raw lists).  
- Maintain exact class names, method names, and signatures from the pseudocode without any renaming or structural changes.  
- Include thorough edge case handling (e.g., empty inputs, None checks) to prevent runtime errors.  
- Use clear, idiomatic Python code with appropriate standard library modules (e.g., `collections`) to optimize clarity and efficiency.  
- Use meaningful variable names that closely reflect the pseudocode intent.  
- Define **all** code, including helper functions, classes, and necessary imports **within a single, properly formatted Python code block** as shown below.  
- Do **not** include any explanations, extra comments aside from reasonable inline clarifications, or separator linesâ€”output only the complete prompt.
