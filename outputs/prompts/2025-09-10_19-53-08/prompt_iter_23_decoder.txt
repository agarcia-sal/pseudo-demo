```python
Translate the given pseudocode into one single, self-contained, clean, runnable Python code block enclosed with ```python ... ```. Your translation must strictly adhere to the following:

- Preserve all class names, method names, and signatures exactly as in the pseudocode, including all class and method order and object-oriented design.

- Accept inputs for complex data structures exclusively as Python lists using `None` to represent missing or null elements (never use 'null' or any other token).

- Inside the same code block, define robust, comprehensive helper functions to convert these input lists into proper Python data structures:
  - For binary trees: build the tree level-by-level (BFS order), correctly placing `None` where specified; handle empty and edge cases flawlessly.
  - For linked lists: build the list linearly, skip or handle `None` nodes properly, ensuring no invalid references.
  - For other custom data structures, adopt similarly rigorous constructions.

- Guarantee that the solution methods operate exclusively on these properly instantiated data structure objects; never directly manipulate the input lists.

- Include all necessary imports explicitly at the top; use only Python standard library modules or widely accepted, pre-approved third-party libraries if absolutely necessary (name them explicitly with justification).

- Use meaningful, clear, and semantically consistent variable and function names that mirror the original pseudocode nomenclature.

- The final code must be efficient, handle every edge case (including empty inputs, single-element data structures, and intermittent nulls), and avoid any runtime errors or attribute errors at execution.

- Do not include any comments, explanations, or extra textâ€”only the final Python code block with the complete solution.

- Disallow use of 'null' or other ambiguous tokens for missing elements; use Python's `None` exclusively.

- Ensure that no data structure input accidentally remains as a raw list by mistake; all such inputs must be passed through the helper constructors before usage.

- Make sure the code is immediately executable and ready for testing in any standard Python 3 environment.
