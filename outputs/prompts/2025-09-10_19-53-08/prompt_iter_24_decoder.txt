Translate the given pseudocode into a single, self-contained, fully runnable Python code block that strictly preserves all class names, method names, and signatures exactly as in the pseudocode, maintaining the object-oriented structure and API without renaming or reordering.

Your output must:

- Enclose the entire solution—including all necessary imports, data structure definitions (e.g., ListNode, TreeNode), and helper functions—within one single Python code block ```python ... ``` with nothing else outside it.
- Accept complex input data structures (such as binary trees and linked lists) **exclusively as Python lists**, with `None` used strictly to denote missing nodes or null references. Do NOT accept or output any other tokens like `null`.
- Define robust, comprehensive helper functions **inside the same code block**, that convert these input lists into properly linked data structure instances.  
  - For binary trees: build trees from level-order traversal lists, correctly assigning `None` children when specified and handling completely empty or sparse trees without error.
  - For linked lists: build linear linked lists from lists, fully respecting `None` as absent nodes and accurately linking all nodes sequentially.
- Guarantee that **all methods in the solution class operate solely on the instantiated data structure objects** (never directly on input lists).
- Thoroughly handle all edge cases, including empty inputs, single-node data structures, consecutive `None` nodes, and any null references, to avoid all runtime or attribute errors.
- Use clear, meaningful variable names aligned closely with the pseudocode semantics to enhance code readability and correspondence.
- Utilize only Python built-in types and standard library modules. If a third-party library is indispensable to improve correctness or efficiency, explicitly mention it in your code comments; otherwise, avoid obscure dependencies.
- Maintain exact method signatures, including argument names and return types, as presented in the pseudocode, with zero modifications.
- Structure the final code for immediate execution and testing without extra text, explanations, or separator lines. Output exactly one Python code block containing the complete, ready-to-run solution.
