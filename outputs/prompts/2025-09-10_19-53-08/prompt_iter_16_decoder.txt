Translate the given pseudocode into a single, fully self-contained, ready-to-run Python code block enclosed in triple backticks ```python ... ``` that strictly adheres to the following guidelines:

- Preserve **all class names, method names, and method signatures exactly as in the pseudocode**, without any renaming or reordering.
- Input complex data structures (e.g., binary trees, linked lists) **only as Python lists**, with missing or null elements represented strictly as Python’s native `None` (never `null` or any other token).
- Inside the same code block, define **robust, comprehensive helper functions or classes** to convert these input lists into their correct Python data structure instances:
  - For binary trees, implement a **level-order builder** that precisely assigns `None` where nodes are missing, correctly handles empty or partial trees, and supports trees with intermittent `None` children.
  - For linked lists, build the sequence correctly skipping `None` where appropriate and supporting empty lists.
- Ensure **all solution methods and class methods exclusively operate on these constructed data structure objects**; do not operate directly on input lists anywhere in the code.
- Rigorously handle **all edge cases**, including empty or partially defined inputs, and avoid any attribute access errors or null reference exceptions.
- Use **clear, descriptive variable names** closely aligned with the pseudocode semantics to maximize readability and maintainability.
- Use only Python’s standard library, or widely accepted third-party libraries if truly necessary, but lean heavily on standard functionality.
- Include all required imports, data structure class definitions, helper functions, and the user-defined solution class **within a single unified Python code block**, providing a complete runnable solution.
- Do not include any explanatory comments, inline commentary, extra textual outputs, or separator lines.
- The final code must be **concise, idiomatic, efficient, and immediately executable**.
