Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully self-contained, efficient, and idiomatic Python implementation inside a single Python code block ```python ... ```. Your code must:

- **Preserve all class names, method names, signatures, and the exact object-oriented design from the pseudocode, without any renaming or reordering.**
- **Accept any input complex data structures—such as binary trees or linked lists—exclusively as Python lists with absent or null entries represented strictly by `None`.**
- **Internally define all data structures (e.g., `TreeNode`, `ListNode`), and comprehensive, robust helper functions that build these structures from the input lists positioned inside the same code block.**
- For trees, construct the structure level-by-level, correctly handling `None` nodes as missing children.
- For linked lists, link nodes sequentially, skipping or ending at `None` entries as appropriate.
- **Never pass or manipulate raw input lists directly in solution methods—only operate on fully instantiated, proper data structure instances built by your helper functions.**
- Handle all edge cases robustly, including empty inputs, single-node structures, and intermittent `None`s, preventing any runtime errors such as attribute errors.
- Use meaningful, semantically aligned variable names consistent with the pseudocode.
- Use only standard Python libraries and built-in types; reliance on third-party packages is allowed only if absolutely necessary and very common.
- Include all imports, data structure definitions, helper functions, and the complete solution class and its methods *within the same Python code block*.
- Output **only one single clean Python code block** without any explanatory comments, blank lines, or extra text.

Your final output must be immediately runnable and maintain the exact API as defined by the pseudocode.
