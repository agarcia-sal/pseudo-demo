Translate the given pseudocode into complete, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that strictly preserves all class names, method names, and signatures exactly as in the pseudocode, including the exact object-oriented design and API.

Your output must:

- Accept complex data structure inputs (e.g., binary trees, linked lists) **only as Python lists** with missing/null elements represented strictly by `None`.
- Internally define and use comprehensive, robust helper functions **inside the same code block** to convert these input lists into their proper Python data structure instances (e.g., binary trees using level-order traversal, linked lists linearly). These helper constructors must flawlessly handle all edge cases including empty inputs and intermittent `None` nodes.
- Guarantee that **all solution methods use only the correctly instantiated data structure objects**; never operate directly on the input lists.
- Handle all possible edge cases and null references to avoid runtime errors.
- Use clear, meaningful variable names that correspond closely to the pseudocode semantics.
- Rely exclusively on Python standard libraries and built-in types; you may also use widely accepted third-party libraries if indispensable, but avoid obscure dependencies.
- Include **all imports, data structure definitions, helper functions, and the solution class with its methods in a single, self-contained Python code block**.
- Output **only one Python code block** with the final, clean, runnable solution—no explanatory comments, no extra text, no separator lines.
- Maintain exact API, class, and method names as per the pseudocode with no renaming or reordering.
- For handling binary tree inputs, ensure your tree builder can handle the input level-by-level and correctly assign `None` children where specified.
- For linked lists, ensure the builder correctly interprets `None` as absence of nodes and correctly links all nodes sequentially.
- Strictly disallow using `null` or any token other than Python’s native `None` to represent missing nodes.
- Ensure that the final code is efficient, handles all edge cases, and ready to execute immediately.
