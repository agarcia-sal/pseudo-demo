Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be high-level and natural-language based, using symbolic representations, abbreviations, and mostly one-liners. Avoid any purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this numbered line format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for compactness and clarity, suitable for a 5-second timeout environment. Output only the pseudocode without additional text.
