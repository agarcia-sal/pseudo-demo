Translate the provided pseudocode into a single, complete, efficient, and idiomatic Python code block that strictly preserves all class names, method names, signatures, and the exact object-oriented structure given in the pseudocode, including order and nesting.

Your output must:

- Accept all inputs as specified by the pseudocode signature; specifically, any complex data structures such as binary trees or linked lists will be given only as Python lists where missing or null nodes are represented **strictly by Python’s `None`** (never use `null` or other tokens).
- Internally declare within the same Python code block robust, self-contained helper functions or classes that correctly and efficiently convert these input lists into the corresponding Python data structures:
  - For binary trees: build the tree level-by-level (BFS order) honoring `None` as missing nodes, correctly placing children; handle empty or partially filled levels without error.
  - For linked lists: sequentially link nodes, skipping or terminating properly on `None` values, fully handling empty or sparse lists.
- Make sure **all solution methods operate exclusively on these proper data structure instances**, never on raw input lists.
- Handle **all edge cases gracefully**, including empty inputs, single-node structures, and malformed lists where applicable, preventing any attribute errors or null reference exceptions.
- Use clear, meaningful variable names that correspond closely to the pseudocode semantics and standard Python conventions.
- Only import and use necessary, widely accepted Python standard libraries or, if absolutely essential, very common third-party packages — but minimal dependencies are preferred.
- Include all imports, data structure definitions, input conversion helpers, and the full solution class with its methods in a single Python code block.
- Output exactly one clean, final, executable Python code block wrapped in triple backticks with `python` (```python ... ```), containing no explanatory comments, no extra text, no debug prints, and no separator lines.
- Maintain the exact API (class names, method names, method signatures) strictly as given in the pseudocode.
- Ensure that your conversion from input list to internal data structures occurs outside of and prior to invoking any logic inside the solution's methods, so that the object's methods never receive raw lists but only fully instantiated data structure objects.
- Guarantee your solution code is production ready: efficient, clean, and free from any runtime errors under all valid inputs.
