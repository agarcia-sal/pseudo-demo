Translate the given pseudocode into idiomatic, efficient Python code that faithfully preserves the original logic, class names, method names, and object-oriented structure exactly as described.  
- Assume inputs such as trees or linked lists may be given as lists (e.g., level-order for trees) containing Python `None` values rather than non-Python tokens like `null`. Include helper functions or classes if needed to correctly construct such data structures from these standard Python inputs.  
- Handle common edge cases gracefully to avoid runtime errors (e.g., check for empty inputs, use proper attribute accesses).  
- Use standard Python packages when appropriate to improve code clarity or performance.  
- Do not change class or method names or their signatures from the pseudocode.  
- Enclose the entire translated code strictly inside a single Python code block formatted as:  
```python
# translated Python code here
```

Your output should only be this prompt.
