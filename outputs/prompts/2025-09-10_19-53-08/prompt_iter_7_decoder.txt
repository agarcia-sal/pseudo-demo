Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that precisely preserves the original logic, function and class names, method signatures, and object-oriented structure as described in the pseudocode. Your translation should meet the following criteria:

- **Input handling:** Assume inputs representing trees, linked lists, or similar data structures may be passed as standard Python lists containing Python `None` values instead of non-Python tokens like `null`.  
- **Data structure builders:** Provide clear, robust helper functions or classes within the output code to convert such Python list inputs into proper tree or linked list objects as needed, so that the main solution method(s) can operate on these objects directly.  
- **Consistency:** Do not change any class names, method names, or method signatures from the pseudocode. Maintain the exact organization, including class definitions and method placements.  
- **Robustness:** Add proper edge case handling (e.g., empty inputs, None checks) to avoid runtime exceptions.  
- **Code quality:** Use idiomatic Python constructs and standard library modules where appropriate for clarity and efficiency (e.g., `collections` for queues).  
- **Readability:** Write clear, well-structured code with sensible variable names that reflect the pseudocode's intent.  
- **Encapsulation:** Include all code, including helper classes/functions, inside a single Python code block formatted as:  
```python
# your translated Python code here
```

Do **not** add extra explanation, comments beyond reasonable code clarity, or separators. Your output **must be only this prompt.**
