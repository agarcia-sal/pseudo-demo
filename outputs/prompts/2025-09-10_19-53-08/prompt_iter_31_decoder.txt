Translate the given pseudocode into a single, self-contained, robust, and efficient Python code block that precisely preserves all class names, method names, and signatures exactly as in the pseudocode, including the full object-oriented design and API structure, without any renaming or reordering.

Your output must adhere to these stringent requirements:

- **Input Handling:** Accept inputs representing complex data structures (e.g., binary trees, linked lists) **strictly as Python lists** where missing or null entries are represented uniquely and exclusively by Pythonâ€™s `None`. Inputs should never contain `null` or any other null-like token.

- **Data Structure Builders:** Inside the same code block, provide clear, comprehensive, and foolproof helper functions that convert these input lists into fully-formed Python data structure instances (e.g., for binary trees, perform exact level-order construction respecting all `None` nodes; for linked lists, build sequential nodes skipping `None` without breaking the linked sequence unless `None` terminates the list). These builders must flawlessly handle empty, partial, and irregular inputs, ensuring no dangling references or corrupted trees/lists.

- **Strict Abstraction:** All core solution code must exclusively operate on these fully constructed Python data structure objects. **Never access or modify the original input lists directly within solution methods.** The solution methods must treat inputs solely as their intended data structures after construction.

- **Complete and Clean:** Include **all necessary imports, data structure definitions, builder/helper functions, and the main solution class with its methods in a single Python code block**. Your final code must be fully runnable as-is, requiring no external modifications.

- **Robustness and Edge Cases:** Your code must handle every edge case gracefully including empty inputs, all-`None` nodes, single-node structures, and irregular input patterns, avoiding all runtime errors such as `AttributeError` or `NameError`.

- **Variable Naming:** Use clear, meaningful, and self-explanatory variable names that map carefully to the pseudocode semantics for maximum readability and maintainability.

- **Minimal Dependencies:** Rely first and foremost on the Python standard library. If absolutely necessary for correctness or efficiency, you may use widely known and trusted third-party Python packages (e.g., `collections` or `typing`), but avoid obscure or rarely used packages.

- **Formatting and Output:** Only output one single, contiguous Python code block using triple backticks with `python`. Inside this block, your full solution should appear cleanly formatted, without unnecessary comments, debugging statements, explanations, or separator lines. Do not include any text outside this code block.

- **Exact API Preservation:** Maintain the exact class, function names, method signatures, and overall structure exactly as given in the pseudocode. Do not add, remove, or reorder elements. 

- **Efficiency:** Ensure your code is optimized for both clarity and runtime performance, ready to be executed directly within typical coding challenge environments.
