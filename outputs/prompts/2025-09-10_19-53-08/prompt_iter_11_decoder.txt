Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that strictly preserves all class names, method names, and signatures exactly as presented, including the original object-oriented structure. Your code must:

- Accept input representations of complex data structures (e.g., binary trees, linked lists) strictly as Python lists where missing nodes or null values are indicated by `None` (never `null` or other tokens).
- Internally define comprehensive, reusable helper functions or classes **within the same code block**, capable of robustly converting these input lists into their corresponding proper Python data structure instances (e.g., binary trees via level-order traversal, singly linked lists). These builders must handle all edge cases flawlessly, including empty inputs and intermediate `None` nodes.
- Ensure that every method inside solution classes operates **only on the correctly constructed data structure objects**, **never on the raw input lists**.
- Handle all potential edge cases and null references carefully to prevent runtime errors.
- Use clear, expressive, and idiomatic Python, leveraging any Python standard libraries or well-known third-party packages if needed, to maximize readability and performance.
- Use meaningful variable names that directly reflect the pseudocode's intent.
- Include all necessary imports, data structure definitions, helpers, and solution code enclosed strictly within a **single properly formatted Python code block**, without any additional commentary, explanations, or extraneous output.
- Avoid any renaming or restructuring of classes and methods — keep the exact pseudocode API intact.
- Do not include any separator lines or unrelated text—output **only the complete and clean code block**.
