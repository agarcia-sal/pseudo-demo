Translate the provided pseudocode into fully functional, idiomatic Python code enclosed in a single Python code block ```python ... ```. Adhere strictly to the class names, method names, and signatures exactly as given in the pseudocode with no renaming or reordering. Your output must meet the following rigorous criteria:

- For complex data structure inputs (binary trees, linked lists, graphs, etc.), **assume inputs are given only as Python lists with missing nodes explicitly set as Python’s `None`** (never use `null` or any other token).
- Inside the single code block, **define all necessary data structure classes and robust helper functions** to convert these input lists into fully connected, correct in-memory data structures—like binary trees built via level-order traversal with accurate `None` children, linked lists built sequentially honoring `None` as node absence, etc.
- The helper converters must correctly handle all edge cases including empty lists, lists with intermittent `None`s, and inputs with only `None`s.
- The main solution methods must **operate exclusively on these properly instantiated data structures**, never on the raw input lists directly.
- Include **all imports, data structure definitions, helper functions, and the solution class with its methods together in one clean, self-contained Python code block**.
- Use descriptive, meaningful variable names closely reflecting the pseudocode semantics to improve readability.
- Guarantee null-safe code, avoiding all attribute errors or runtime exceptions by carefully checking for `None` where necessary.
- You may use only the Python standard library and widely accepted third-party packages (like `typing`, `collections`, etc.); avoid obscure or niche dependencies.
- The final code should be efficient, fully tested against edge cases, and immediately runnable.
- Do not output any comments, explanations, or extra text—only the final single Python code block with the solution.
- Maintain the exact OOP structure as per pseudocode, preserving class definitions and method signatures verbatim.
