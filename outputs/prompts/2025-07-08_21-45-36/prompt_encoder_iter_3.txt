Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations. Present the pseudocode as numbered steps with one-liners where possible, avoiding comments, explanations, summaries, or purpose statements. Use high-level constructs and keep it compact. Follow this format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity. Do not include notes or overviews. Your function has a 5-second timeout; deliver the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
