Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code. Enclose the entire code output within a single Python code block using triple backticks like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Focus on clear variable names, proper indentation, and idiomatic Python constructs. Ensure the solution can be understood easily and runs efficiently within a 5-second execution limit. Do not include explanationsâ€”only the code.
