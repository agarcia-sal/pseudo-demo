Write pseudocode that solves the given problem description. The pseudocode should be concise, compact, and high-level, using natural language mixed with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Prefer one-liners and avoid detailed explanations, comments, or purpose statements. Make it easy to read and understandable. Follow this numbered line format exactly:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include any summary, overview, or notes; only the pseudocode itself. Your solution should run efficiently within a 5-second timeout.
