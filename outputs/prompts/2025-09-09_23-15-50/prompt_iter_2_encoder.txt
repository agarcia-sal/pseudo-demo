Write concise, high-level pseudocode that directly solves the given problem, using a mix of natural language and symbolic notation. Keep the original function names unchanged. Favor compact statements and one-liners, using abbreviations and intuitive symbolic operators. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand without any summaries, explanations, comments, or notes. Format the output with numbered lines exactly as follows:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not add section dividers, headers, or extra text. Only output the pseudocode steps. The solution should complete efficiently within a 5-second timeout.
