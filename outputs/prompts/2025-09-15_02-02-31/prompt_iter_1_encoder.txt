Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Write the pseudocode using natural language mixed with symbolic forms, keeping it high-level and compact. Use mostly one-liners, abbreviations, and symbolic statements. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity, ensuring the pseudocode is understandable at a glance. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for the best output within this limit.
