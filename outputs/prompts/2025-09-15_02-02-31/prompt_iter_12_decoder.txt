Translate the provided pseudocode into fully functional, idiomatic, efficient, and well-structured Python code that strictly preserves all class names, function names, method signatures, and class hierarchies exactly as given. Your code must:

- Retain all class and method definitions without any changes to their names or signatures.
- Correctly and safely handle complex input types that may be given as raw Python lists, nested lists, or JSON-like data structures and convert them into appropriate Python objects (e.g., implement helper classes like TreeNode, ListNode, or graph structures when needed).
- Include robust input validation and conversion utilities for common data structures (trees, linked lists, graphs), seamlessly handling edge cases such as empty inputs, None values, or malformed data.
- Use standard libraries and popular, well-maintained packages if beneficial (e.g., collections, functools, heapq, typing) to enhance clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Implement any necessary helper classes or functions inside the code block, ensuring the solution is completely self-contained.
- Optimize the solution for runtime efficiency and memory usage to meet a strict 5-second execution limit on typical input sizes encountered in competitive programming and coding challenge platforms.
- Avoid any code that might raise uncaught exceptions on valid inputs from the problem context.
- Output only the fully implemented Python code snippet enclosed within a single triple backtick Python code block, with no additional commentary, explanation, or anything outside the code block.

Example structure:

```python
# Your complete code here,
# preserving all naming and structural requirements,
# including helper classes and input converters.
```

Your translation must produce robust, precise, efficient code that respects the original pseudocode intent and works flawlessly on all valid test inputs.
