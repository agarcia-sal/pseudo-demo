Translate the given pseudocode into highly robust, clean, and optimized Python code that fully respects the original class names, function names, method signatures, and structural hierarchy exactly as stated. Assume all custom data types (e.g., trees, linked lists, graphs) follow standard Python conventions or commonly accepted formats; where appropriate, implement helper functions or classes to convert input formats into usable Python objects within your code. 

Your solution must:

- Precisely preserve all class definitions and method signatures without alteration.
- Validate and safely handle inputs that may be provided as raw lists or other standard JSON-like structures for complex data types (e.g., convert list representations of binary trees into TreeNode objects internally).
- Include any necessary support classes (e.g., TreeNode, ListNode) if required to faithfully implement the supplied pseudocode.
- Leverage Python standard libraries and well-known modules to improve clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Produce fully working code that does not raise exceptions when tested with typical input types aligned with the pseudocode context.
- Be efficient enough to run under a strict 5-second execution limit.
- Output only the complete Python code snippet enclosed in a single code block marked with ```python at the start and ``` at the end.
- Provide no explanations, commentary, or text outside this code block.

This prompt must enable perfect fidelity in translation, correct handling of edge cases, and seamless interoperability with typical input formats encountered in algorithmic challenge platforms.
