Translate the given pseudocode into precise, efficient, and production-ready Python code. Adhere strictly to the following requirements:

- Preserve all class names, method names, function signatures, and hierarchical structure verbatim as presented in the pseudocode. Do not rename or restructure.
- Explicitly implement any auxiliary data structures (e.g., ListNode, TreeNode) with correct typing and Python conventions. These implementations should robustly handle input conversions from common JSON-like or primitive formats (e.g., lists, None/null) into proper class instances internally and seamlessly.
- Include utility functions or staticmethods for these data types to convert between native Python representations (lists, tuples, primitives) and their class instances, ensuring inputs like `[1,2,null,3]` are transformed correctly while handling `null` as Python `None`.
- Incorporate comprehensive input validation and edge case safeguards consistent with the problem domain implied by the pseudocode, avoiding runtime exceptions under typical or boundary inputs.
- Optimize algorithmic efficiency and leverage Python standard libraries or well-established third-party modules (allowed to be imported without restriction) to ensure correctness, clarity, and execution within a 5-second timeout.
- Return or output exactly as specified by the pseudocode (no additional printing, comments, or explanations).
- Provide **only** the final complete Python code enclosed within a single markdown code block starting with ```python and ending with ``` â€” no extra text or separators.

Your output should be one standalone, syntactically correct Python snippet that can be run directly and matches the pseudocode semantics exactly.
