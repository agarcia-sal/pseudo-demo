Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, clean, and idiomatic Python code that exactly preserves the original logic and structure. Use the same class names, method names, parameters, and object hierarchies as specified in the pseudocode. Write the entire solution enclosed within a single Python code block formatted as ```python ... ```. Your implementation must be efficient, correct, and runnable within a 5-second execution time limit. Use any standard Python libraries if needed, but avoid unnecessary imports. Do not output any explanation, comments, or text outside the code block. Ensure functions, classes, and data types exactly match typical Python conventions for the described constructs in the pseudocode. Handle common edge cases implicitly based on pseudocode logic. Prioritize correctness, clarity, and faithful translation over any additional embellishments.
