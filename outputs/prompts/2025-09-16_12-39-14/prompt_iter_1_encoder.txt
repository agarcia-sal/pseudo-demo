Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic forms, prioritizing compactness and high-level clarity. Write pseudocode as numbered steps, mostly one-liners, with abbreviations and simple control structures. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—only provide the pseudocode instructions themselves. Follow this format precisely:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your function runs under a 5-second timeout; produce the best results within this limit.
