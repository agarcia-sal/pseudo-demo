Translate the following pseudocode into Python code that is clear, correct, and efficient.  
- Maintain the exact class names, function names, and method signatures as presented in the pseudocode, preserving the class and object structure precisely.  
- Implement all logic faithfully and ensure the produced code is runnable within a 5-second time limit.  
- Include any necessary imports and helper functions or classes, using standard libraries or popular well-maintained packages if it improves correctness or efficiency.  
- Handle inputs and outputs exactly as implied by the pseudocode, and do not add extra wrapper code or input/output code beyond what the methods require.  
- Write Pythonic, idiomatic, and readable code, with well-named variables and concise constructs without sacrificing clarity.  
- Pay special attention to common pitfalls from the examples: do not change method signatures, avoid undefined names (e.g., convert `null` to `None`), and do not add or omit parameters.  
- Avoid infinite recursion or performance issues by using iterative or optimized approaches where appropriate.  
- Ensure no explanatory text or comments appear outside of the single code blockâ€”only output the complete translated Python code inside one fenced code block formatted as:  
```python  
# translated Python code here  
```
