Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code that preserves the exact class names, method signatures, and overall structure shown in the pseudocode. Your implementation must be robust, handle common edge cases, and be optimized to run within a 5-second timeout. Use any necessary standard Python libraries or packages to improve performance and clarity. Enclose all your Python code in a single code block formatted as:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Do not include any explanations, comments, or text outside the code block. Ensure the resulting Python code is directly runnable and accurately represents the pseudocode logic and semantics without altering provided names or structures.
