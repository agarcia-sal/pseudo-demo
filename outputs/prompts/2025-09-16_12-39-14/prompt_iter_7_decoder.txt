Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code that exactly preserves the original algorithm and logic. Keep the class names, method names, signatures, and object-oriented structure identical to those specified in the pseudocode. Your code must be correct, optimized to run within 5 seconds, and leverage appropriate standard libraries or built-in features for clarity and performance. Avoid any explanatory comments or text outside the code. Enclose **all** the Python code within a single, properly formatted code block:

```python
# your full translated code here
```

Make sure your code handles standard input types and edge cases gracefully as implied by the pseudocode, uses Pythonic conventions for control flow and data handling, and avoids introducing any extraneous output, prints, or debug statements.
