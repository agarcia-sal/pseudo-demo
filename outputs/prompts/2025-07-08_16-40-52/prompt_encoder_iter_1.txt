Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations in a compact, high-level style. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, notes, comments, or explanations—only provide the pseudocode itself. Format step numbers as shown:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for mostly one-liners and clear structure. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best possible results within this limit.
