Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and efficient Python code optimized for clarity, correctness, and runtime within 5 seconds. 

- Enclose your entire code output strictly within a single Python code block, like this:

```python
# Your code here
```

- Your code should be self-contained and use `input()` without prompt strings for any inputs.
- Avoid printing unnecessary debug or separator lines.
- Use standard or commonly available Python modules where appropriate to enhance efficiency or readability.
- Include concise comments only if they improve understanding of non-trivial logic.
- Strive for robustness and handle typical edge cases based on the pseudocode logic.
- Prioritize straightforward, well-structured code following Python best practices.
