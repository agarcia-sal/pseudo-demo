Translate the given pseudocode into a single, clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python program that:

- Runs correctly within 5 seconds on typical inputs derived from the pseudocode.
- Reads all inputs exclusively via `input()` calls without prompt strings.
- Produces output exactly as specified by the pseudocode logic, without extra debug, separator lines, or extraneous prints.
- Uses only standard or widely available Python libraries/packages if they enhance clarity, performance, or correctness.
- Includes minimal, clear comments only for complex or non-obvious parts of the logic.
- Handles reasonable edge cases implied or suggested by the pseudocode.
- Follows Python best practices and prioritizes readability, maintainability, and correctness.

**Output your entire solution strictly enclosed in one single Python code block like this:**

```python

```

Your response must not contain any text outside the code block.
