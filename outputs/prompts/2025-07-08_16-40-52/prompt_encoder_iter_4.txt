Generate clear, concise, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description.  
Use a high-level, compact style blending natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations. Prefer mostly one-liners that make logic explicit and flow clear.  

Follow these rules:  
- No explanations, summaries, comments, purpose statements, or overview—only numbered pseudocode steps.  
- Use “let” or “set” for declarations and assignments.  
- Use “read” for inputs and “print” for outputs.  
- Use standard control flow constructs (for, while, if) in concise form, with inline conditionals when appropriate.  
- Number each step as shown (no separator lines):  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example pseudocode format to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
	set min_i to i  
	for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A  

Complete your output quickly and precisely within 5 seconds, ensuring the pseudocode strictly follows the above style and guidelines.
