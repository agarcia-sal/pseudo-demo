Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description and original code. Use natural language with symbolic and abbreviated forms to keep it compact and easy to read. Always retain the original function names exactly as given. 

Output only the pseudocode, without explanations, comments, summaries, or extra text. Prefer single-line statements and simple control structures. Avoid verbose constructs; use idiomatic forms like:

```
in function FUNCTION_NAME(args)
let VAR be TYPE or inferred
if x = y: do_something
for i in 0..n-1: action
x ‚Üê x + 1
return RESULT
```

Follow this exact style and format, starting each pseudocode output directly with the first step. Do not include separators or extra formatting. Your output must be a clean, compact pseudocode representation faithful to the original code logic.
