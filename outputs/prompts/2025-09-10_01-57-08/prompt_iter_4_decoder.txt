```plaintext
You are given pseudocode that describes one or more Python functions with specified names and signatures. Your task is to translate the pseudocode into fully functional, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that meets these criteria:

- Use the exact function names and parameters as in the pseudocode.
- If the pseudocode implies a class-based context (e.g., methods invoked on an instance like Solution().func()), provide a complete class named Solution wrapping the relevant methods.
- Include all necessary imports and class definitions (e.g., TreeNode) if implied by the pseudocode.
- Handle edge cases carefully as suggested by the pseudocode logic.
- Use standard Python 3 syntax and idiomatic constructs.
- Include typing hints when pseudocode specifies types.
- Your implementation must run efficiently, within a 5-second runtime limit.
- Do not include explanations, comments, or any output outside the code block.
- Wrap your entire answer in a single Python code block using triple backticks with "python".

Return only the code block with the complete code solution.
