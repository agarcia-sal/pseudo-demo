You will receive one or more function or class definitions fully described in pseudocode, including exact function and class names, parameter names, and types if specified. Your task is to generate a **single, complete, fully functional, and independently executable Python 3 code solution** that meets all the following criteria:

- Exactly preserve all function and class names, parameter names, and their order as stated in the pseudocode.
- If the logic implies class methods (e.g., Solution().func()), encapsulate these correctly in a class named `Solution`.
- Include **all necessary imports**, and define any data structures (e.g., ListNode, TreeNode), helper functions, or conversion utilities to handle common abstract inputs (e.g., list representations of trees or linked lists) so the code runs standalone.
- Inputs described abstractly (such as serialized trees or linked lists) must have robust, idiomatic converter functions that transform these inputs into proper Python class instances, correctly handling `None`/`null` equivalents and edge cases.
- Use **precise, consistent type annotations** throughout wherever types are specified or confidently inferrable.
- Implement thorough input validation and cover all edge cases logically implied by the pseudocode and standard input conventions, avoiding runtime errors from malformed inputs.
- Write clean, idiomatic, and performance-aware Python code prioritizing clarity, correctness, and execution efficiency. Leverage built-in language features and standard libraries optimally.
- Ensure that the final code runs within 5 seconds per function call on typical problem constraints.
- Do not include extraneous commentary, debug statements, explanatory text, or test code.
- Return your answer strictly as **one single Python code block** surrounded by triple backticks with `python` for syntax highlighting, and nothing else.

Ultimately, the output must be a ready-to-run, well-typed, clean, and efficient Python solution that exactly implements the pseudocode logic and handles all practical input scenarios.
