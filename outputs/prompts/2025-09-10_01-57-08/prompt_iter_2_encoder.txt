Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand from the given problem description and original code. Use more natural language combined with symbolic forms and abbreviations to keep it compact. Maintain the same function names as in the original code. Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, summaries, notes, or comments. Favor one-liner statements and simple control structures where possible. Follow this exact format:

1. in function FUNCTION_NAME  
2. let VARIABLE be TYPE or inferred from context  
3. use natural phrases like "for i in 0..n-1" or "if x = y: do_something"  
4. for procedure or helper functions, start with "define FUNCTION_NAME(args):"  
5. prefer concise statements, e.g., "x ← 0", "while x < n: x++", "return RESULT"

Produce only the pseudocode following these guidelines. Do not include any code, explanation, or additional text.
