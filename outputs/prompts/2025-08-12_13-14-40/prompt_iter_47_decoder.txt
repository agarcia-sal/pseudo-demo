Translate the given pseudocode into clear, correct, and efficient Python code that runs within 5 seconds. Your code must:

- Use only standard input calls as `input()` with no prompt strings.
- Handle all input/output explicitly and concisely, assuming the input format is described in the pseudocode.
- Avoid any separator lines or extra printing besides the final required output.
- Be fully self-contained and accurate, leveraging any Python standard libraries if helpful.
- Prioritize code readability, appropriate variable names, and succinctness without sacrificing clarity.
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block as follows:

```python
# translated Python code here
```

Focus on correctness, robustness, and simplicity to ensure high-quality, test-ready implementations.
