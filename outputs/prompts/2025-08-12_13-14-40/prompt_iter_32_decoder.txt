Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that prioritizes correctness, readability, and performance. Your implementation should:

- Use only `input()` for all inputs without prompts or explanatory text.
- Include clear, concise comments explaining key steps or logic only when necessary.
- Avoid any extra output, debug prints, or separator lines.
- Handle typical edge cases implicitly if applicable.
- Utilize Pythonâ€™s standard library or any external packages if it makes the solution cleaner and more efficient.
- Produce code limited to a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Generate Python code that is optimal enough to run correctly within 5 seconds for typical inputs, balancing clarity and succinctness without sacrificing robustness or style.
