Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and readable Python code that handles input and output using only `input()` and `print()` (without prompts or extra messages).  
- Enclose all code within a single, properly formatted Python code block using triple backticks and `python`.  
- Write concise code that runs correctly within a 5-second time limit on typical inputs.  
- Avoid any decorative or separator lines in your output or code.  
- You may use any standard Python libraries or modules if they improve clarity or performance.  
- Prioritize correctness, clarity, and idiomatic Python style while making the implementation as straightforward and maintainable as possible.  

Example structure to follow:
```python
# Your Python code here, reading input with input() and outputting with print()
```
