Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code that prioritizes correctness, readability, and concise runtime within 5 seconds. Your solution should:

- Use a single Python code block enclosed exactly as follows:

```python
# your translated code here
```

- Read all inputs strictly with generic `input()` calls (no prompts inside `input()`)
- Avoid printing any extraneous text or separator linesâ€”output only what is required
- Leverage any standard Python libraries or modules as needed to optimize clarity and efficiency
- Follow idiomatic Python practices, including meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and sufficient commenting if needed for clarity
- Handle edge cases and assume typical valid input formats explained by the pseudocode
- Write code that can be directly copy-pasted and run without modification

Deliver a final implementation that balances simplicity, robustness, and performance within the time constraints.
