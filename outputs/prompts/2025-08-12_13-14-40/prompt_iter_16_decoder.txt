Translate the given pseudocode into Python code that is clean, idiomatic, and efficient, ensuring the implementation runs correctly within a 5-second time limit. Your translation must:

- Enclose all code in a single Python code block like this:
  ```python
  # translated code here
  ```
- Use plain `input()` calls with no prompt strings for reading inputs.
- Avoid any separator or decorative lines in the output or code.
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and performance within the constraints.
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries necessary to enhance efficiency or readability.
- Include concise comments only if they improve understanding without clutter.

Produce final code onlyâ€”no explanations or additional text outside the code block.
