Translate the provided pseudocode into concise, clear, and efficient Python code that runs correctly within 5 seconds. Your implementation should:

- Use idiomatic, readable Python.
- Read inputs strictly with `input()` calls (no prompts inside input).
- Not include any extra output or separator linesâ€”output only what the problem requires.
- Employ any standard Python packages if needed to maximize clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Enclose all code in a single Python code block, exactly like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```
