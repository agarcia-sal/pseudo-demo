Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that prioritizes correctness, readability, and runtime performance within a 5-second execution constraint.  
- Enclose the entire implementation within a single Python code block formatted as follows:  
```python
# Your complete translated code here
```  
- Your code should read all inputs strictly using `input()` without any prompt strings and produce output precisely as expected.  
- Avoid adding any extraneous separators, comments unrelated to clarity, or debug prints.  
- You may use any standard Python libraries or packages to improve efficiency and clarity.  
- Aim to produce concise, well-structured, and well-named code that directly reflects the logic of the pseudocode, handling edge cases gracefully.  
- Ensure your code is ready for immediate execution without any further modification.
