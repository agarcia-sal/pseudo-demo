Given a problem description, generate succinct, clear, and high-level pseudocode that prioritizes readability and natural language with minimal but effective use of symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to maximize compactness. Convey logic mostly in one-line statements for simple operations, conditions, and loops without sacrificing clarity. Use meaningful variable names and uniform indentation of one tab or 4 spaces for blocks.

Output only the pseudocode—no comments, explanations, summaries, or notes of any kind. Do not include separator lines or metadata. Number every line starting at 1 and increment by 1 continuously. Favor concise expressions and natural phrasing; apply symbols like ←, ++, <, = only where they reduce verbosity while keeping code understandable.

Example style to follow (do not add extra lines or commentary):

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
  set min_i to i  
  for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
8. print all elements of A
