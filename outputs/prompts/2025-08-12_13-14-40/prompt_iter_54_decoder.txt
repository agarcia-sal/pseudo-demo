Translate the provided pseudocode into accurate, clean, and efficient Python code that prioritizes correctness, readability, and performance within a 5-second execution constraint.  
- Enclose your entire solution inside a single Python code block, like this:
```python
# your translated code here
```
- Use plain standard input calls: `input()` without prompts or additional text.  
- Avoid adding separator lines or extraneous comments unless they improve understanding of complex logic.  
- Leverage any standard Python libraries or packages if they help produce a concise and performant solution.  
- Ensure your code handles typical edge cases implied by the pseudocode and follows Python best practices for naming and style.  
- Focus on writing self-contained code that directly implements the logic from the pseudocode without extra unrelated functionality.
