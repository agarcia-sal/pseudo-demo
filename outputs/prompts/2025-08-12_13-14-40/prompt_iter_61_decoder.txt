Translate the given pseudocode into clean, highly efficient, and well-structured Python code that prioritizes readability, correctness, and performance within a strict 5-second runtime limit. 

- Enclose the entire code within a single Python code block, formatted exactly as follows:

```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

- Use simple, standard `input()` calls without prompt strings (e.g., no `input("...")`), to ensure compatibility with automated input.

- Avoid any separator lines or extra formatting outside the code block.

- You may import and use any standard Python libraries or packages if they can improve clarity or performance.

- Write concise, idiomatic Python code with proper naming and comments only if they improve understanding without verbosity.

- Keep your solution self-contained and directly runnable, assuming input is read from standard input and output printed to standard output.  

- Aim to handle edge cases gracefully and implement efficient algorithms suitable for potentially large inputs within the time constraint.
