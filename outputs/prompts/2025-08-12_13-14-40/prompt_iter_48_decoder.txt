Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code. Your solution must:

- Be fully self-contained and executable within 5 seconds.
- Avoid any input prompt strings; use plain `input()` for reading inputs.
- Produce output exactly as expected, without extra formatting or separator lines.
- Import and use any standard Python libraries if they help improve correctness and efficiency.
- Follow best practices for readability, clarity, and Pythonic style.
- Enclose the entire code within a single Python code block as shown:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Focus on correctness, optimal resource usage, and maintainability.
