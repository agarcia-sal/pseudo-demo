Translate the given pseudocode into correct, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that runs within 5 seconds. 

- Enclose the entire solution within a single Python code block as follows:  
```python
# your translated code here
```
- Use plain `input()` for all input reading, without prompt strings.  
- Your code must be clean, readable, and concise without unnecessary verbosity or comments.  
- Handle all inputs and outputs exactly as implied by the pseudocode (no extra prompts or prints).  
- You may use any standard Python libraries or packages if they improve clarity or performance.  
- Prioritize correctness and optimal runtime behavior, optimizing algorithms and data structures as needed.  
- Do not include separator lines, explanatory text, or any output other than the required results.
