Translate the given pseudocode into well-structured, efficient, and readable Python code that strictly uses standard input/output with `input()` and prints output via `print()`. Enclose all your code within a single Python code block as follows:

```python
# Your implementation here
```

Your translation should:

- **Use no input prompts or explanations inside `input()` calls** â€” just plain `input()` for all inputs.
- **Produce correct and optimized code that runs within 5 seconds** on typical inputs.
- **Avoid any extra output or separator lines**; only output what is required by the logic.
- **Prefer built-in Python libraries and idiomatic constructs** for clarity and performance.
- **Handle edge cases gracefully** and maintain concise, clean code consistent with Python best practices.

Do not include comments or any code outside the Python code block.
