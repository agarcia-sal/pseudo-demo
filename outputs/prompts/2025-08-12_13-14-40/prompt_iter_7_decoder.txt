Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code that prioritizes correctness, readability, and optimal performance within a 5-second runtime limit.  
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block using:  
```python  
# your code here  
```  
- Your code must:  
  - Use plain `input()` calls without any prompt strings.  
  - Avoid any separator lines, comments unrelated to clarity, or redundant prints.  
  - Make use of Python standard libraries or third-party packages if they improve clarity or efficiency.  
  - Include appropriate function definitions if beneficial for modularity and clarity.  
  - Handle all logical steps explicitly from the pseudocode; do not assume unstated input formats or constraints.  
- Strive for concise yet clear code which runs accurately and efficiently on all valid inputs within the time limit.
