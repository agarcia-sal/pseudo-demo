Translate the given pseudocode into idiomatic, well-structured, and efficient Python code that prioritizes readability, correctness, and performance within a 5-second execution limit. Use only standard input calls as `input()` without prompt strings. Your code should handle inputs and outputs exactly as described by the pseudocode, assume no extra explanation or instructions in input, and be ready for direct execution.

- Enclose your entire solution within a single Python code block like this:
```python
# your translated code here
```
- Avoid using any visual separators or extraneous output.
- You may use any standard Python libraries or modules if they help improve clarity and efficiency.
- Write clean, concise code that clearly reflects the logic and structure of the given pseudocode while ensuring correctness and optimal runtime performance.
