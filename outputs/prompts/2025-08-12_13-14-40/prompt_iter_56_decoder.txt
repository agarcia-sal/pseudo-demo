Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, clean, and efficient Python program. Your translation must meet the following criteria:

- Enclose the entire solution within a single Python code block using triple backticks:
```python
# translated code here
```
- Use only `input()` for reading input, with no prompts or arguments inside `input()`.
- Produce output exactly as implied by the pseudocode, with no extra formatting or debug prints.
- Prioritize correctness, clarity, and concise implementation that respects a 5-second execution limit.
- You may leverage any standard Python libraries or packages if they improve the solution’s efficiency or readability.
- Avoid unnecessary comments, separator lines, or extra explanations—deliver only the final working code.
- Make sure variable names and structure reflect the logic from the pseudocode as directly and idiomatically as possible.
