Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code. Your implementation must:

- Use only standard input via `input()` without prompt strings.
- Include no extraneous output or separator lines.
- Be concise, readable, and optimized to run within a 5-second limit.
- Use any necessary Python standard libraries or third-party packages for best performance and clarity.
- Enclose the entire solution within a single Python code block like this:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Focus on correctness, adherence to Pythonic idioms, and comprehensive handling of edge cases.
