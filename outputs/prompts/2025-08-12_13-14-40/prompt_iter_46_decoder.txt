Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and efficient Python code that reads input using plain `input()` calls (without prompt strings) and outputs results as needed. Use idiomatic Python to maximize readability and performance, relying on standard libraries or well-known packages if helpful. 

Enclose the entire solution strictly within a single Python code block like this:

```python
# your complete translated code here
```

Ensure the implementation is concise, correct, and optimized to run within 5 seconds for a range of inputs. Avoid adding any extraneous text, comments unrelated to clarity, or separator lines. Focus on correctness, clarity, and practical efficiency while maintaining elegant style.
