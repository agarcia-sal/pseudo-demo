Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code that emphasizes correctness, clarity, and optimal runtime performance within 5 seconds.  
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block as shown below:  
```python
# Your translated code here
```  
- Your code should use standard input methods strictly as `input()` without custom prompts or messages.  
- Avoid any separator lines or extraneous output; produce only the final required output from the logic.  
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries or packages to enhance simplicity and efficiency.  
- Write concise, idiomatic Python code with meaningful variable names and clear logic flow.  
- Include appropriate comments only if they improve readability without overwhelming the code.  
- Prioritize thorough correctness and robustness, ensuring the output matches the intended pseudocode behavior exactly.  
- Optimize for performance so the implementation reliably executes within the time limit on typical problem scales.
