Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and efficient Python code that is ready to run as-is. Your implementation must:

- Use concise and clear variable names.
- Include proper handling of inputs exclusively via `input()` calls with no prompt strings.
- Not include any extraneous print statements or separator lines.
- Conform to best Python practices for readability, maintainability, and performance.
- Be optimized to run correctly within a 5-second time limit on typical inputs.
- Import and use any standard or third-party Python libraries if they improve clarity or efficiency.
- Enclose the entire solution within a single Python code block, exactly as below:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Focus on correctness, robustness, and idiomatic Python style â€” the code should be ready for direct execution without modification.
