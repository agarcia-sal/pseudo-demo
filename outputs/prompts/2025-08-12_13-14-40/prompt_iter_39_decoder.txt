Translate the given pseudocode into correct, clean, and efficient Python code that can run within 5 seconds.  
- Do not include any prompts or explanatory text in input() callsâ€”use plain input() with no arguments.  
- Use any standard Python packages as needed to enhance performance or clarity.  
- Your code should be self-contained, handling all input/output exactly as the pseudocode implies.  
- Ensure the code is concise but readable and follows best practices for Python 3.  
- Enclose **only** the final code in a single Python code block like this:

```python
# Your translated code here
