Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code. Your implementation must:

- Use idiomatic Python and leverage standard or widely available libraries as needed to maximize clarity and efficiency.
- Handle input using plain `input()` calls without prompts or messages.
- Produce correct and concise code that runs within a 5-second time limit.
- Include robust edge case handling where applicable.
- Enclose all your code within one Python code block exactly as below:

```python
# your translated Python code here
```

Do not add any extra explanations, comments about inputs, or separator lines outside the code block. Focus on correctness, readability, and performance.
