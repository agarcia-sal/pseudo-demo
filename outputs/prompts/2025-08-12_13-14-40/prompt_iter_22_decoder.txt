Translate the given pseudocode into clear, correct, and optimized Python code that can execute within 5 seconds. Your implementation should:

- Use only standard Python libraries or widely available, performant packages if needed.
- Handle input using `input()` calls without any prompt strings.
- Produce output exactly as required by the logic, with no extra formatting or separator lines.
- Include meaningful variable names and comments to enhance readability, but keep the code concise and efficient.
- Enclose the full code inside a single Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Focus equally on correctness, readability, and runtime efficiency. Avoid unnecessary complexity while ensuring robustness and clarity.
