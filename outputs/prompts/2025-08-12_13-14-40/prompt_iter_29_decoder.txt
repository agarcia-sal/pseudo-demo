Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that prioritizes correctness, readability, and performance within a 5-second runtime.  
- Enclose your entire solution within a single Python code block as shown below:  

```python
# your translated code here
```  

- Use standard input/output operations with plain `input()` callsâ€”do not include prompts inside `input()`.  
- Avoid printing extra text or using separator lines. Only output what the problem requires.  
- You may leverage any standard or third-party Python libraries to optimize the implementation.  
- Ensure variable names, code structure, and comments clearly reflect the logic from the pseudocode, making it easy to understand and maintain.  
- Optimize for both clarity and execution speed, balancing brevity with explicitness to avoid ambiguity or errors.  
- Do not assume constraints beyond those in the pseudocode; your code should be robust and handle edge cases gracefully.
