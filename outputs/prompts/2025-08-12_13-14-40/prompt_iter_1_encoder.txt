Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that is high-level and uses natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where possible. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Use one-liners and compact formatting as in the example below:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Format steps clearly and sequentially. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible output within this limit.
