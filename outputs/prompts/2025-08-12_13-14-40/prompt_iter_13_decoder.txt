Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code that strictly adheres to the following requirements:

- Enclose all your code inside a single Python code block with triple backticks and the language specifier `python`.
- Use plain input reading with `input()` and output with `print()`. Do not include any prompt strings inside the input functions.
- Focus on correctness, readability, and performance optimization under a 5-second runtime limit.
- You may import and use any Python standard or third-party libraries that help produce concise and optimal implementations.
- Avoid adding extra comments or decorative separators; keep the code minimal and clear.
- Preserve the logic and flow dictated by the pseudocode, but refactor where appropriate to improve clarity and runtime efficiency.

Here is how you should format your output:

```python
