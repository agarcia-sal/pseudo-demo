Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and idiomatic Python code, prioritizing correctness, readability, and efficiency within a 5-second execution limit.  
- Enclose your entire solution in a single Python code block as follows:  
```python
# your code here
```  
- Use plain `input()` calls without prompts for all inputs.  
- Avoid any extraneous printing, comments, or separator lines outside the code block.  
- Use built-in or standard Python libraries whenever it helps improve clarity or performance.  
- Write concise code but do not compromise clarity or correctness for brevityâ€”aim for balanced, production-quality code.  
- Ensure variable names and structure clearly reflect the logic from the pseudocode.
