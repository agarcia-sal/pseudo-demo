Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code that prioritizes clarity, correctness, and performance. Your solution must strictly adhere to the following requirements:

- Enclose all code within a single Python code block formatted as:
  
  ```python
  # translated code here
  ```

- Use simple, generic input reading with `input()` statements onlyâ€”do not include prompts or descriptive strings inside `input()`.

- Avoid any extraneous output formatting, separator lines, or comments unrelated to code clarity and functionality.

- Focus on writing idiomatic Python that runs optimally within a 5-second execution limit, utilizing built-in functions and standard libraries as appropriate for efficiency.

- Ensure the solution handles edge cases and is robust to typical input variations.

- Maintain concise, readable code without sacrificing performance or correctness.
