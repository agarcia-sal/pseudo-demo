Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code that prioritizes correctness, readability, and performance within a 5-second runtime constraint.  
- Enclose **all** your code strictly within a single Python code block, like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```

- Handle all input using `input()` without any prompt strings, to ensure compatibility with automated testing.  
- Do not include any extra output formatting or separator linesâ€”only produce the exact solution code and necessary output.  
- Use standard libraries or any built-in Python packages if they improve clarity or efficiency.  
- Optimize your implementation for clarity and correctness, avoiding unnecessary complexity while ensuring it runs efficiently within the time limit.
