Translate the given pseudocode into Python code that is correct, clean, and efficient. Your implementation must:

- Use standard input/output with plain `input()` and `print()` statements only (no prompts or extra text).
- Avoid any separator lines or extraneous formatting.
- Include all code strictly within a single Python code block like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```

- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and concise structure, ensuring the program runs within 5 seconds.
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries if needed to improve efficiency or code quality.
- Write idiomatic Python that would be considered production-quality and easy to maintain.
