Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and readable Python code that precisely implements the described logic. 

- Enclose the entire code output within a single Python code block using three backticks and `python` like this:
  
  ```python
  # your translated code here
  ```

- Your code **must** read inputs strictly with `input()` (no prompt strings).
- Do **not** include any extraneous output, comments unrelated to clarity, or separator lines.
- You may use any standard Python libraries or packages to improve efficiency and clarity.
- Prioritize correctness and clarity first, then optimize for runtime efficiency to ensure execution within 5 seconds.
- Assume input format follows directly from the pseudocode but do not add assumptions beyond what is stated.
- Avoid any unnecessary verbosity; keep code concise but readable, using idiomatic Python constructs wherever appropriate.
