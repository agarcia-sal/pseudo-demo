Translate the given pseudocode into robust, clean, and highly efficient Python code that strictly runs within a 5-second time limit. Follow these guidelines precisely:

- Enclose the entire implementation within a single Python code block using:
  ```python
  # translated code here
  ```
- Use only `input()` for reading inputs, without any prompt strings.
- Do not include any separator lines, comments about input, or extraneous explanations in your codeâ€”only the necessary code.
- Prioritize clarity and correctness, but also optimize for runtime efficiency and minimal memory usage.
- You may leverage any standard Python libraries or packages if they help improve performance or simplicity.
- Write the code in a way that it can handle a variety of input sizes gracefully and produce correct results reliably.
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity or overly complex constructs; concise and straightforward solutions are preferred.

Produce the final Python code accordingly.
