Given the input pseudocode, analyze its logic thoroughly and determine if it is sufficiently complete and unambiguous to produce consistent outputs that would pass all unit tests for any valid inputs. Factors to consider include: presence of all necessary steps, correct handling of edge cases, absence of logical contradictions or infinite loops, and clear definition of inputs, outputs, and operations.  
Output 1 if the pseudocode is reproducible under these criteria, otherwise output 0.  
No explanation or additional text; output only the single digit 1 or 0.
