Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and well-structured Python code that is optimized for clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiency (within 5 seconds for typical inputs). Use standard Python conventions and only rely on built-in libraries or widely available packages when explicitly useful for performance or simplicity. Your translated code must:

- Read input exclusively via `input()`, without any prompt strings.
- Produce no output other than the necessary code implementing the required logic.
- Avoid any explanations, comments beyond essential ones inside code, or extra text outside the code.
- Enclose **all** your code inside a single Python code block formatted exactly as:
  
  ```python
  # Your delivered code here
  ```
  
Focus on producing concise, robust, and idiomatic Python solutions that handle edge cases gracefully and leverage Pythonic constructs where appropriate. Do not insert line separators or unrelated formatting.

Strictly adhere to these instructions to maximize reliability and test-time correctness.
