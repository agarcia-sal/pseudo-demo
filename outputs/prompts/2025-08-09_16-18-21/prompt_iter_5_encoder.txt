Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand using natural language with symbolic notations and abbreviations. Present the pseudocode compactly, favoring one-liners where possible, without any explanations, summaries, purpose statements, or comments. Use clear, numbered steps as in the format below (no separator lines or extra formatting):

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

The output should be solely the pseudocode, structured logically and efficiently, suitable to be implemented directly. Aim for clarity through compactness and natural phrasing while respecting the 5-second runtime limit.
