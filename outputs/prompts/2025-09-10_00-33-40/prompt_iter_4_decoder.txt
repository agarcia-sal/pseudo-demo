Translate the given pseudocode into correct, clean, and efficient Python 3 code. Preserve all function names and signatures exactly as presented in the pseudocode. Your output must include all necessary imports or class definitions implied by the pseudocode (e.g., typing imports, data structures like ListNode). Ensure the code runs correctly as a standalone snippet without any undefined references or dependencies on external classes such as `Solution`. Optimize for readability and clarity while maintaining reasonable performance (aim to complete within 5 seconds). Enclose the entire Python code solution strictly within triple backticks followed by `python`:

```python
# Your fully implemented Python code here
```
