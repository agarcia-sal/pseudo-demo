Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Use mostly one-liners and compact statements. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanatory notes—just the pseudocode itself. Follow this format for lines and structure:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second timeout.
