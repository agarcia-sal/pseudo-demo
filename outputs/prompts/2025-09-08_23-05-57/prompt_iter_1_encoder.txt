Generate pseudocode for the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable, using concise, high-level language with natural wording. Use symbolic representations, abbreviations, and one-liners where possible. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow a numbered line format, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your function times out after 5 seconds; prioritize producing the best possible result within this limit.
