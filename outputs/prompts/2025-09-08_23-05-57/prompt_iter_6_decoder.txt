Translate the given pseudocode into well-structured, idiomatic Python code, strictly preserving all original function and variable names exactly as presented. Your implementation should prioritize correctness, clarity, and efficiency without sacrificing readability. Use Pythonic constructs and standard libraries where appropriate to achieve optimal performance and minimal complexity, ensuring the code runs efficiently within 5 seconds. Include succinct comments only when they meaningfully aid understanding of non-trivial logic. Output **only** the Python code enclosed in one properly formatted Python code block (```python ...```). Do not include any explanation, text, or formatting outside this code block. Here is the pseudocode:
