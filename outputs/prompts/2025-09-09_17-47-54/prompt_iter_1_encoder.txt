Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language combined with symbolic forms and abbreviations. The pseudocode should be compact, high-level, and mostly one-liners. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Use a numbered step format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; generate the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
