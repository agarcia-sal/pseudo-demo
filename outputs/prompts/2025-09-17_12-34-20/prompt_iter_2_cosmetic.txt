Given the original pseudocode as input, produce a completely restructured and rephrased version of this pseudocode that fulfills these requirements:

- The output must strictly contain *only* the rewritten pseudocode, with no explanations or extra text.
- Preserve all original class names, function names, and their exact placement in the same class/object hierarchy as in the original.
- Keep all the original functionality intact, including parameters and return behavior.
- Maximize syntactic and stylistic differences by applying any combination of the following transformations:
  - Renaming all variables and local identifiers consistently to new, unrelated names.
  - Changing control structures (e.g., replacing WHILE loops with FOR loops or recursion where appropriate, swapping IF-ELSE branches, restructuring conditions logically).
  - Reordering independent statements or blocks without affecting logic.
  - Switching between different but equivalent data structure notations and operations.
  - Altering indentation and whitespace style as long as structural clarity is preserved.
  - Using alternate language constructs or synonyms for operations (e.g., "ASSIGN" instead of "SET", "INCREMENT" vs. adding 1).
  - Rephrasing expressions and conditions without changing their semantic meaning.
  
Do **not** modify any class or function names, and do **not** introduce or remove any class or function definitions relative to the original code.

Your primary goal is to generate pseudocode that functions identically but reads and appears structurally and lexically as different as possible from the original.

Only output the fully rewritten pseudocodeâ€”nothing else.
