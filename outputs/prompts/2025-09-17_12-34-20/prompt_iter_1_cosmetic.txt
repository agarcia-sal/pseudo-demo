Given the original pseudocode as input, generate a new version of this pseudocode that is functionally identical but differs as much as possible in structure, style, variable names, control flow, and presentation. Ensure that all original function names and class names remain exactly the same, preserving the original class hierarchy and object structures. The output should contain only the rewritten pseudocode without any explanations or additional text.
