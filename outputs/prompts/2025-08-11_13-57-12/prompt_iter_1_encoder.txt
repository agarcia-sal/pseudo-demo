Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode using natural language and symbolic notation. The pseudocode should be compact and high-level, favoring one-liners and abbreviations without comments, explanations, purpose, summary, or overview statements. Follow the format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce only the pseudocode. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for clear, efficient output within this limit.
