Write only the pseudocode derived from the given code, preserving all original function and class names, definitions, and their nesting or object structure exactly as in the source. The pseudocode must be concise, abstract, and high-levelâ€”prioritize clarity and readability using plain English with natural language expressions and conventional programming terms (e.g., FUNCTION, FOR, IF, RETURN), avoiding ambiguous shorthand or unnecessary verbosity. Do not include any explanations, summaries, comments, notes, or line separators. Use consistent indentation and clearly indicate control flow and data operations. Represent common operations using natural language that balances readability and brevity, for example:

- Use verbs like SET, INCREMENT, APPEND, RETURN, CALL, etc.
- Express loops and conditionals with clear keywords (FOR, WHILE, IF, ELSE).
- Keep expressions straightforward but expressive (e.g., "FOR each item IN list", "IF condition THEN", "RETURN result").
- Maintain the same level of abstraction as original code, avoiding implementation details unless needed for understanding logic.

Your output must contain strictly the pseudocode reflecting the logic and structure of the input code, suitable for comprehension and direct translation back to code by an experienced developer.
