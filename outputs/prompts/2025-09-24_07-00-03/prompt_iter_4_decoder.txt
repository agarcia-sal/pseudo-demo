Translate the given pseudocode into clear, well-structured, and efficient Python code that preserves all function and class names exactly as in the pseudocode, as well as maintaining the same class and object structure. Your output must be a complete, runnable, and accurate implementation that can stand on its own without external explanation.

- Preserve original function and class names exactly as given.
- Preserve class definitions and object-oriented structure precisely as indicated.
- Optimize the code for clarity, efficiency, and idiomatic Python style.
- Include appropriate Python standard library or third-party libraries if they improve correctness or performance.
- Add concise inline comments only where necessary to improve understanding.
- Enclose your entire output within a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# Your complete translated Python code here
```

Do not add separator lines, explanations, or extraneous text outside the code block. Focus on producing the best possible Python translation that will pass all test cases under the 5-second constraint.
