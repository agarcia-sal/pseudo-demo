Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to read. Focus strictly on the sequence of algorithmic steps without explanations, summaries, comments, or notes. Prefer mostly one-liner statements but use nested indentation for loops, conditionals, and functions to maintain logical flow and clarity. Use meaningful yet brief variable names and concise expressions. Follow exactly this format and style:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Do not insert separator lines, extra blank lines, or any text other than pseudocode.

Example style to follow:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
