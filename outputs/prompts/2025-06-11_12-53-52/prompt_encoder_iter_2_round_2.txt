Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode strictly from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language mixed with symbolic notations and abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to understand. Avoid any explanatory text, summaries, comments, or overview statements—output only the pseudocode instructions. Favor one-line statements wherever possible. Structure your pseudocode to follow this format:

1. variable ← initial_value  
2. while condition: operation  
3. for index in range: operation  

Use indentation to represent nested blocks or loops, but do not use separator lines or extra formatting. Prefer descriptive but brief variable names. Your pseudocode should emphasize algorithmic steps clearly and efficiently within a 10-second response limit.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be array of integers size n  
read A elements  
for i from 0 to n-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j from i+1 to n-1  
  if A[min_i] > A[j] set min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print A elements
