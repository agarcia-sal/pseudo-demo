Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use natural language combined with symbolic operators and abbreviations to keep it compact and efficient. Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, summaries, comments, or notes. Prefer one-liner statements where possible and maintain clarity. Follow this exact numbered format without separator lines or extra formatting:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use phrases like "let", "read", "set", "for", "while", "if", "swap", etc. to represent steps clearly. Emphasize algorithmic flow at a higher level but precise enough to implement. The output should look like a readable script of steps, not code in any specific language. Your response must finish within 10 seconds to ensure best possible quality.
