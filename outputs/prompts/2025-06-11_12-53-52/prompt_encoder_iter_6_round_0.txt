Generate clear, concise, and compact high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language combined with symbolic notations and abbreviations when appropriate. Focus exclusively on the algorithmic steps; do not include any purpose, summary, explanation, notes, or comments.

Prefer one-liner statements whenever possible and keep the pseudocode succinct and structured. Use simple control flow constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals) expressed in a natural and brief form.

Follow this exact formatting style:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Avoid any separator lines or extraneous formatting.

Example style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for each element i in A  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j from i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  if A[min_i] > A[j]: min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
