Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it compact and readable. Express the algorithm strictly as sequential steps, focusing only on logic and control flow. Avoid explanations, summaries, or comments—output pseudocode only.

Use mostly one-liner statements and simple indentation for nested blocks (loops, conditionals, functions). Prefer short but meaningful variables and operators. Follow this exact format for lines:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Do not include separator lines, blank lines, or extra spacing. Output the minimal yet complete pseudocode that captures the core algorithm.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
