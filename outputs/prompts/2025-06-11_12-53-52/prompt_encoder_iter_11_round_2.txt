Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode strictly from the given problem description. Write mostly natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations to keep it high-level and compact. Use mostly one-line statements that capture essential algorithmic steps only—no explanations, summaries, comments, or any extra text. Use meaningful but brief variable names; apply concise control structures (loops, conditionals, functions) naturally and succinctly. Follow exactly this numbered format with no extra spacing or separators:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Output only the pseudocode, strictly adhering to this style and formatting.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
