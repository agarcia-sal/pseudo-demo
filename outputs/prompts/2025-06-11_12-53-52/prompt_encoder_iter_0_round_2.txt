Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be clear, readable, and understandable, emphasizing natural language with compact expressions. Use symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate. Keep the pseudocode succinct—prefer one-liner statements and minimal structural complexity without comments, explanations, or summaries. Output only the pseudocode, strictly following this format:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation

Avoid any separator lines or extra formatting.

Example style your output should emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A  

Your output must focus solely on algorithmic steps without added commentary. You have a 10-second timeout—produce the most effective pseudocode within this limit.
