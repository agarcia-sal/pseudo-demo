Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code.  
- Enclose **only** the resulting Python code within triple backticks specifying Python, like:  
```python  
...  
```  
- The code must handle input via `input()` without prompt strings.  
- Do **not** output any explanations, comments, or extra textâ€”only the Python code block.  
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries to maximize efficiency and correctness.  
- Prioritize correctness, clarity, and performance; keep the solution concise and optimized to run within 10 seconds.  
- Respect all algorithmic details given in the pseudocode exactly as specified.
