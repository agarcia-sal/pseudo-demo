Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand, using natural language combined with symbolic representations and abbreviations where helpful. Keep it compact and focused only on algorithmic steps without any explanations, summaries, purpose statements, or notes. Prefer one-liners and straightforward, minimal syntax in the style shown below. Do not include separator lines or extra formatting.

Use this format as a guideline:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example pseudocode style your output should follow:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A  

Produce only the pseudocode steps clearly and succinctly within a 10-second timeout.
