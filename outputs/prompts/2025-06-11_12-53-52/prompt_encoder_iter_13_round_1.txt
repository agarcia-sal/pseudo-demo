Generate easy-to-read, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description, using mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations to keep it compact and clear. Focus strictly on the algorithmic steps only; do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes. Prefer concise, mostly one-liner statements with clear logical flow. Use short but meaningful variable names and standard symbolic forms. Structure conditionals, loops, and function definitions naturally and succinctly. Follow this exact format for each step:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation

Avoid separator lines, extra blank lines, or verbose constructs. Output only the pseudocode, nothing else.  

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
