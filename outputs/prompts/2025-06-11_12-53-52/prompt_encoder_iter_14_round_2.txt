Generate concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description using mostly natural language mixed with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. The pseudocode should be easy to read and logically structured, emphasizing algorithmic steps only. Use mostly one-line statements and avoid verbose explanations, summaries, or comments—output only the pseudocode.

Employ clear, meaningful but succinct variable names; prefer symbolic forms and standard conventions where possible. Represent loops, conditionals, and function definitions naturally and compactly, following this exact format for line numbering and style:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation

Do not include separator lines, extra blank lines, or explanatory text. The output must be solely the pseudocode in a format similar to this example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
