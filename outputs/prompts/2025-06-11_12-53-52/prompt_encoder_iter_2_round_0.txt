Generate concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description. Output only the pseudocode with no explanations, summaries, or notes—strictly algorithmic steps. Use clear, readable natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to follow. Prefer one-line statements unless multiple lines improve clarity. Use imperative verbs and simple control structures. Follow this exact format for each line:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Avoid separator lines, comments, or extra formatting. Emphasize a balance of natural language and symbolic clarity, for example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers of size n  
read elements into A  
for i from 0 to n - 1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j from i + 1 to n - 1  
  if A[min_i] > A[j]: min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print A  

Produce the most compact, clear pseudocode possible within 10 seconds, focusing solely on the algorithmic logic.
