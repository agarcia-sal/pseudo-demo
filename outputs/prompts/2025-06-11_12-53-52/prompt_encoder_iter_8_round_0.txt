Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode directly from the given problem description. Use natural language combined with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to ensure readability and compactness. Focus exclusively on the algorithmic steps—do not include any purpose, summary, explanations, or comments. Avoid verbose constructs and unnecessary details. Prefer one-line statements where possible, following this numbering and style format:

1. variable ← initial_value  
2. while condition: perform action  

Do not add separator lines or extra formatting. The pseudocode should reflect a logical flow that is easy to understand and implement, maintaining brevity without sacrificing clarity. Here is an example style your output should emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
