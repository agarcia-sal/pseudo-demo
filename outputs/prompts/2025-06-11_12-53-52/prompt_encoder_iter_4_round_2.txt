Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use natural language combined with symbolic notations and abbreviations, focusing on compactness and clarity. Provide only the pseudocode—no purpose statements, summaries, explanations, comments, notes, or section separators. Prefer one-line statements and a clear stepwise numbering as shown below:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Use this style consistently, for example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive: set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A

Produce direct, succinct pseudocode emphasizing algorithmic steps only. Your output must execute within a 10-second timeout and deliver the best possible result within this constraint.
