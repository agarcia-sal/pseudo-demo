Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description using mostly natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations where appropriate. The pseudocode should be easy to read, compact, and focus strictly on algorithmic steps—no explanations, summaries, notes, or commentary. Use mostly one-liner statements, avoiding verbose constructs but ensuring clarity and logical flow. Follow this format exactly:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Use clear variable names when needed, but prefer brevity and symbolic forms. Structure loops, conditionals, and function definitions naturally and succinctly. Do not insert separator lines or extra spacing. Output only pseudocode, nothing else.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
