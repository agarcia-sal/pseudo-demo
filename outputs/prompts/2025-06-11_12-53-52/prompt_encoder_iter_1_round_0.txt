Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language combined with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Output only the pseudocode without any purpose, summary, explanation, overview, or notes. Use compact one-liners wherever possible, and prefer succinct statements that directly reflect algorithmic steps. Follow this exact format for line numbering and style:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Emphasize clarity and brevity while preserving complete logical flow. Use constructs like loops, conditionals, and assignments naturally and minimally. Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
	set min_i to i  
	for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A  

Your output must strictly conform to concise, high-level pseudocode of this style only. Complete the response within 10 seconds.
