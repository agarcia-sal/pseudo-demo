Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Prefer one-liners and compact statements without comments. Follow this format:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Your pseudocode should be clear, succinct, and focused solely on algorithmic steps. Your function has a 10-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
