Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode based strictly on the given problem description. Do not include any explanations, summaries, comments, or overview statements—only pseudocode instructions in an easy-to-read style that combines natural language and symbolic notation. Use compact one-liners wherever possible, including abbreviations and intuitive symbols. Avoid separator lines or extraneous formatting. Follow this exact numbering format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should emphasize clarity and brevity, capturing only the core algorithmic steps at a high level without unnecessary detail. For control structures, write conditions and operations concisely on the same line when feasible. Use natural language phrases such as "let", "set", "read", "print", "for each", etc., to make it intuitive yet succinct. The output should be solely pseudocode, ready to be understood and implemented. You have a 10-second timeout—produce the best pseudocode you can within this limit.
