Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. The pseudocode should be easy to read, logically clear, and compact—prefer one-liners and minimal verbosity without losing structure or correctness. Focus strictly on algorithmic steps; do not include explanations, summaries, comments, or extraneous notes. Use clear but brief variable names and natural constructs for loops, conditionals, and function definitions. Follow this exact line numbering and formatting style:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Avoid separator lines or extra blank lines. Output only pseudocode, nothing else.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
