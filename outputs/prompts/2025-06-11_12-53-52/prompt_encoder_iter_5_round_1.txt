Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Write only the pseudocode—no explanations, summaries, comments, or notes. Use natural language combined with symbolic and abbreviated expressions. Keep it easy to read, compact, and focused solely on the algorithmic logic. Prefer one-liner statements and maintain clarity. Follow this format precisely:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Begin with function or main procedure declarations where relevant. Use control structures such as loops and conditionals in a straightforward way. The pseudocode should represent the full algorithm clearly and efficiently within a 10-second processing limit.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
