Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description using mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. The pseudocode must be easy to read, logically clear, and compact—prefer brief one-liner statements that capture only algorithmic steps without any explanations, comments, or summaries. Use meaningful but concise variable names and standard control structures (loops, conditionals, function defs) naturally and succinctly. Follow this exact format for statements:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Avoid extra spaces or blank lines and do not include separator lines or any formatting beyond what’s shown. Output only the pseudocode, nothing else.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 forj=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
