Generate concise, easy-to-read, high-level pseudocode strictly from the given problem description. Use natural language combined with symbolic representations and abbreviations to keep it compact. Do not include any purpose statements, summaries, explanations, notes, or comments—output only the pseudocode steps. Prefer one-liner statements where feasible, following this numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Structure control flows clearly but succinctly, using minimal indentation and straightforward constructs. Start with function or main if appropriate, declare variables briefly, and express all algorithmic steps precisely and efficiently. Avoid extra formatting like separator lines or extra whitespace. Produce the best pseudocode within a 10-second time limit.
