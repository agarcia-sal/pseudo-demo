Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations for clarity and brevity. Write pseudocode that is easy to read, logically structured, and compact, focusing strictly on algorithmic steps without any explanations, summaries, comments, or notes. Prefer one-liner statements and express conditions, loops, and assignments succinctly. Use clear but short variable names and symbolic forms where natural. Follow this exact numbered format with no extra spacing or separator lines:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Structure loops, conditionals, and function definitions naturally and compactly. Output only the pseudocode, nothing else.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
