Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode directly from the problem description. Output only the pseudocode without any explanations, summaries, comments, or notes—strictly algorithmic steps. Use natural language combined with symbolic operators and abbreviations where helpful, aiming for brevity and readability. Prefer compact one-liners and simple control structures. Follow this exact numbering format with an arrow (←) for assignments and inline operations for loops and conditions:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  
3. for variable in range: operation  

Do not include separators, headers, or extra formatting—only numbered pseudocode lines describing the algorithm logically and succinctly. Your pseudocode should be easy to understand yet minimalistic and focused purely on the implementation logic, suitable for direct translation to code. The function has a 10-second timeout; produce the highest-quality output possible within this constraint.
