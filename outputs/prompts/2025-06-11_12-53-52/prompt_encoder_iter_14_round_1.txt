Generate concise, compact, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description using mostly natural language with selective symbolic notation and abbreviations for clarity and brevity. The pseudocode must be easy to read, logically structured, and focused strictly on algorithmic steps only—no explanations, comments, summaries, or clarifications. Favor mostly one-line statements and succinct constructs, using clear but brief variable names. Represent loops, conditionals, and function definitions naturally and smoothly, avoiding unnecessary verbosity. Use this exact numbered line format:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Do not insert separator lines or extra blank lines. Output only the pseudocode, nothing else.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
