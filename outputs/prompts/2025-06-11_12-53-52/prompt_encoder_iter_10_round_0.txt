Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that emphasizes clarity and readability with predominantly natural language, incorporating symbolic notation and abbreviations to maintain compactness. Present the pseudocode strictly as algorithmic steps without summaries, explanations, comments, or formatting lines. Prefer mostly one-liner statements with clear logical flow, using structured loops, conditionals, and function definitions where appropriate. Use brief but meaningful variable names, opting for symbolic forms when suitable. Follow this exact format for statements and control structures:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Avoid extra spacing, blank lines, or separators. Output only the pseudocode, nothing else.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
