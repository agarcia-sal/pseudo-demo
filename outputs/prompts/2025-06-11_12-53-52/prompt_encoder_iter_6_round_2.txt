Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode based solely on the given problem description. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand, using natural language enriched with symbolic operators and standard abbreviations. Produce compact, mostly one-line statements focused strictly on algorithmic steps—no explanations, comments, summaries, or notes. Follow this style and format exactly (without separators):

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use indentation to indicate code blocks and control flow clearly. Use imperative verbs (e.g., let, read, set, swap, print) and standard control structures (for, while, if) naturally. When defining variables or data structures, specify their type and size succinctly (e.g., “let A be array of size n”). Avoid verbose phrasing or extraneous text.

Output only the pseudocode that fully encapsulates the solution algorithm at a high level but with precise operational detail. Your response should be optimized for clarity and brevity within a 10-second generation limit.
