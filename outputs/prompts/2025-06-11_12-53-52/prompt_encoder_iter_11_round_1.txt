Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations where appropriate. The pseudocode must be easy to read and logically flow step-by-step but remain compact. Prefer mostly one-line statements and avoid verbose constructs. Use meaningful but brief variable names and natural syntax for loops, conditionals, and function declarations. Do not include any explanations, summaries, comments, or notes in the output. Output only the pseudocode, exactly following this format:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Do not add separator lines or extra blank lines. Strive for a balance between readability and brevity.

Example representing the style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
