Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Output only the pseudocode with no explanations, summaries, or notes. Use clear, natural language combined with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to understand. Favor one-liners and succinct statements. Follow this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Structure the pseudocode in logical blocks (e.g., function definitions, loops, conditionals) without extra separators or comments. Use indentation to show nesting. Your pseudocode should emphasize algorithmic steps clearly and efficiently, balancing readability and brevity. Do not include variable type declarations unless needed for clarity. Produce the best possible pseudocode within a 10-second time limit.

Example output style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
