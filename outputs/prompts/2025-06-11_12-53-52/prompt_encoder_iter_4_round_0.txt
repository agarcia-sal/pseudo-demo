Generate concise, high-level pseudocode directly from the problem description without any summaries, explanations, or clarifications. Use clear, natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations for compactness. Structure the pseudocode as sequential, numbered steps with mostly one-liners, prioritizing brevity while maintaining readability. Follow this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid comments, unnecessary whitespace, or separator lines. Use common control flow constructs (if, while, for, function) and standard operations. Declare variables plainly (e.g., "let n be integer") and keep loops and conditionals simple and compact.

Example style your output should emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A

Focus solely on algorithmic steps with no added text or formatting beyond this pseudocode style.
