Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read high-level pseudocode strictly from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and standard algorithmic abbreviations. Keep it compact and focused on essential algorithmic steps only—no summaries, explanations, comments, or notes. Prefer one-line statements; allow minimal indentation for nested loops and conditionals to show logical structure clearly but avoid verbose syntax. Use meaningful yet brief variable names with symbols where helpful. Follow this exact style and format:

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation

Do not include separator lines, extra spacing, or any text outside the pseudocode itself. Output only the pseudocode.

Example style to emulate precisely:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
