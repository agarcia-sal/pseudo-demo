Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description, using mostly natural language enriched with symbolic notation and brief abbreviations. The pseudocode should be compact, easy to read, and strictly focused on the algorithmic steps—no explanations, summaries, or clarifications. Use mostly one-line instructions, maintaining logical flow and natural structure for loops, conditionals, and function definitions. Prefer clear but short variable names and symbolic expressions wherever possible. Follow this exact numbering format without extra spacing or separator lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode, nothing else.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
