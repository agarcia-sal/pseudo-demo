Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly clear natural language enriched with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to read. The pseudocode should strictly represent algorithmic steps only—no explanations, summaries, comments, or extra descriptions. Prefer mostly one-line statements; use indentation to show nested loops and conditionals naturally. Use brief but meaningful variable and function names, favoring clarity through natural phrasing over cryptic symbols. Follow exactly this format:  

1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Include only pseudocode—no separator lines, no empty lines, no extra text before or after. Do not restate the problem or provide any notes. Emphasize precise, logical flow with minimal verbosity.  

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
