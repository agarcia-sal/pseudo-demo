Generate clear, compact, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand, focusing strictly on essential algorithmic steps—no explanations, summaries, notes, or comments. Prefer concise one-liners and logical flow with minimal but clear variable names. Structure loops, conditionals, and function definitions naturally and succinctly.

Follow this exact format with no added blank lines or separators:  
1. variable ← value  
2. while condition: operation  

Output only the pseudocode, nothing else.

Example style to emulate:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
