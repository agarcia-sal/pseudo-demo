Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description.  
Use clear, natural language mixed with symbolic notation and abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to understand.  
Do not include any explanations, summaries, purpose statements, or notes—output only the pseudocode.  
Prefer one-line statements where possible, but use indentation and structure to convey control flow clearly.  
Follow this numbered format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use simple commands like let/set/initialize/read/print, loops (for/while), conditionals (if/else), assignments, and function calls naturally.  
Avoid separators, extra formatting, or comments.  
Focus purely on the algorithmic steps in a general style applicable to any problem.  
Your solution must be succinct but sufficiently expressive to capture the logic clearly.  
Produce the best possible pseudocode within a 10-second runtime constraint.
