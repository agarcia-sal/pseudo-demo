Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable, using natural language, one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format precisely with numbered lines and indentation as needed:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible output within this limit.
