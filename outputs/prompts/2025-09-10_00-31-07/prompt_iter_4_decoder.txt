Translate the given pseudocode into complete, clean, and efficient Python code exactly matching the function names and logic described. If the pseudocode defines a function inside a class (e.g., `Solution`), include the function accordingly; otherwise, define the function at the top level. Include any necessary supporting classes or imports that are implied by the pseudocode. Your Python code must be fully executable and pass typical test cases within a 5-second runtime.

**Strictly output only the Python code enclosed in a single properly formatted code block as shown:**

```python
# your translated Python code here
```

Do not output any explanations, comments beyond minimal necessary code clarity, or extra text. Use standard Python practices, and you may import any built-in or publicly available packages if helpful. Ensure your code handles edge cases and follows best performance and readability standards.
