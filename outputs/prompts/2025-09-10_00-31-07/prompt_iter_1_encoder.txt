Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Avoid purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not include comments or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Structure the pseudocode in numbered lines as shown below:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for mostly one-liners and clear logic. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best output within this limit.
