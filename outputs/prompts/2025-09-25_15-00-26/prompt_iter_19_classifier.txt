Task:  
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each representing a standalone algorithm intended to pass its full set of unit tests for correctness, edge cases, error handling, and output consistency. For each snippet, output exactly one digit:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is guaranteed *fully reproducible*, meaning any direct, faithful implementation of it (with no added assumptions or omitted details) will pass **all** conceivable unit tests, including normal, boundary, corner cases, invalid input scenarios, and error conditions as implied or reasonably expected from the general problem domain.  
- `0` otherwise, if there is *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, unstated assumption, missing initialization, partial logic, or potential failure mode that could lead to one or more failed tests.

Output all digits concatenated **in the exact order** pseudocodes are given, without any spaces, line breaks, or additional characters. Nothing else should appear in output.

---

**Definitions and Instructions:**  

*Fully reproducible* means:  
- The pseudocode is fully explicit, unambiguous, and self-contained so that a reader or implementer can precisely derive a correct, deterministic implementation passing every possible related unit test without guessing or filling any gaps.  
- It handles *all* logically relevant input scenarios (valid and malformed) that the problem concerns or reasonably implies.  
- Every variable, data structure, and state component is explicitly declared and initialized before use, with no reliance on defaults or external context.  
- Control flow (loops, recursion, conditionals) is fully described, terminates properly, and covers *every* necessary logical branch and case without overlap, gaps, or contradictions.  
- Algorithmic steps are complete and logically coherent: no omissions, contradictions, or vague constructs.  
- Boundaries, edge cases, exceptional conditions, and error modes (like empty inputs, zero divisions, overflows, invalid inputs) are handled explicitly or logically guaranteed safe without assumptions.  
- Outputs are precisely specified, deterministic, and consistent with typical problem output expectations (types, format, range).  
- There is no dependency on unstated external code, environment, libraries, or side effects.  
- Stylistic or idiomatic choices are irrelevant *unless* they introduce logical gaps or ambiguity.  
- If *any* uncertainty remains as to reproducibility—even if minor or rare—output `0`.

**Step-by-step evaluation checklist per snippet (all must be unquestioningly fulfilled for output `1`):**

1. **Complete input domain coverage**  
   - All input types and value ranges, including empty or minimal inputs, boundary numeric values, special characters, malformed inputs implied by problem context, and atypical conditions are either explicitly handled or logically safe (no failure or unspecified behavior).  
   - No implicit assumptions on input filtering, formatting, or preconditions.

2. **Explicit declarations and initializations**  
   - Variables, arrays, counters, accumulators, flags, and any helper state are declared and initialized before usage, with clear scope and no use of undefined references.

3. **Deterministic, comprehensive control flow**  
   - Every loop, recursion, and branching condition is precisely defined, reachable, and terminating.  
   - All logical cases and sub-cases in conditionals and switches are enumerated without gaps or conflicts.  
   - No infinite loops or premature breaks that could cause incomplete processing or wrong output.

4. **Complete, unambiguous algorithmic logic**  
   - Every step—computations, updates, state mutations— is clearly and fully described, with no contradictions or missing components.  
   - Arithmetic, indexing, data transformations are clearly and correctly defined.  
   - No vague statements or steps that rely on reader inference.

5. **Robust handling of boundaries and error conditions**  
   - Edge cases: zero-length inputs, max/min values, empty collections, zero division, overflow, underflow, invalid or unexpected inputs are handled explicitly or guaranteed safe without assumption.  
   - Defined error handling or fallback behavior is present when invalid inputs arise or errors could occur.  
   - Array and index boundaries are safely checked and respected.

6. **Fully deterministic output specification**  
   - Outputs (final returns or side data) are precisely stated, consistent, and deterministic functions of inputs and internal state, with no ambiguity or unspecified formatting.

7. **Absolute self-containment**  
   - No references to external functions, libraries, environment-specific features, or unstated global context.  
   - The snippet is fully interpretable and implementable as-is.

8. **No harmful ambiguity or gaps introduced by style or idioms**  
   - Pseudocode style or conventions do not obscure logic or leave essential details unstated.

---

**Crucial decision principle:**  
- If and only if *all* above criteria are clearly met with zero ambiguity or interpretative uncertainty, output `1`.  
- If there is *any* doubt, missing detail, incomplete branch, unstated assumption, or possible test failure, output `0`. This includes snippets that are nearly correct but slightly incomplete (“near-misses”), or cosmetically different but logically ambiguous.

---

**Additional notes:**  
- Do NOT speculate or invent missing details, no matter how reasonable they seem.  
- Perform deep logical scrutiny, considering *all* conceivable test cases (normal, boundary, error).  
- Beware subtle issues such as unhandled edge cases, missing initialization, partial control flow coverage, ambiguous returns, implicit variable values, dependence on unstated context, or potential infinite loops.  
- Assume standard computational and memory model; do not infer language or implementation-specific behaviors.
