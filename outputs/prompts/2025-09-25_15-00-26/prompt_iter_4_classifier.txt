Given the pseudocode below, your goal is to determine with high precision whether it is **fully reproducible**, meaning the pseudocode is logically complete, unambiguous, and correctly structured so that any implementation strictly following it will pass **all** of its intended unit tests. This implies it must be free from logical errors, subtle bugs, undefined behaviors, or insufficient detail that would cause failure or ambiguity in the outputs compared to the specified requirements.

### Instructions for the evaluation:

- Carefully analyze all parts of the pseudocode: initialization, loops, conditionals, data structures, recursion, boundary conditions, arithmetic operations, and return values.
- Consider typical edge cases that unit tests cover (e.g., empty input, single-element input, maximal or minimal inputs, invalid inputs if specified).
- Verify that numeric computations, indexing, and data updates align with accepted correct algorithms.
- Confirm there is no ambiguity, missing steps, or inconsistencies that could cause divergent or incorrect results.
- Consider variations in variable naming, syntactic style, or small cosmetic changes **do not** invalidate reproducibility if logical correctness is fully preserved.
- Differentiate near-miss cases (e.g., those that fail a small fraction of tests) from fully reproducible ones. Only output 1 if every test is guaranteed to pass reliably and unambiguously.
- Output **only** a sequence of digits, each being 0 or 1, with no extra text, spaces, or formatting. The ith digit corresponds exactly to the ith pseudocode input block.

### Decision rule summary:

- Output **1** if the pseudocode is deterministically correct and fully covers all casesâ€”i.e., it will pass all unit tests without exception.
- Output **0** if there exists any reasonable scenario, inconsistency, ambiguity, or incompleteness that can cause a unit test to fail or be uncertain.
- Do **not** give partial credit or intermediate values; this task requires a binary decision.

### Pseudocode to evaluate (each block corresponds to one decision output):

```
<INSERT_PSEUDOCODE_HERE>
```

**Remember:**

- Your output should be a compact string of 0s and 1s corresponding one to one to the order of input pseudocodes.
- Do not output any explanations, notes, clarifications, or formatting.
- Treat each pseudocode input independently but output results concatenated in order.
- Focus on logical correctness, completeness, and unambiguity as they relate to passing all unit tests under reasonable assumptions.
