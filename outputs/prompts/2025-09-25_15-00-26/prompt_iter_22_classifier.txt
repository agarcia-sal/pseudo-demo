Task:  
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets. For each snippet, your sole output must be a single digit: `1` if the pseudocode is *fully reproducible* or `0` if it is not.  
Output ONLY the concatenation of these digits in the exact order the pseudocodes are provided, with NO spaces, line breaks, or any other characters. No explanations or comments.

**Definition of *fully reproducible*:**

A pseudocode snippet qualifies as *fully reproducible* only if **every faithful implementation that strictly follows it—without adding, assuming, or guessing any unstated details—would pass 100% of all conceivable unit tests related to its intended functionality.** This includes tests for:  
- all valid input types, ranges, and formats (normal, edge, boundary, empty, special cases, invalid/malformed inputs within defined scope),  
- all error, failure, and exception scenarios expected from the problem domain,  
- all logical branches, loops, and recursion,  
- all state manipulations and outputs,  
- and any corner or atypical cases.

**Guiding Principles for Evaluation (apply with zero tolerance for ambiguity):**

1. **Exhaustive and explicit input handling:**  
   - The pseudocode must explicitly or logically cover *every possible valid and invalid input* condition within the problem’s scope, including empty inputs, zeroes, null/none equivalents, extreme boundaries, special characters, and malformed values.  
   - No implicit assumptions or skipped validations about input validity, format, or range.

2. **Complete and unambiguous initialization of all states:**  
   - Every variable, data structure, buffer, accumulator, flag, counter, or state element must be clearly declared and fully initialized *before use*.  
   - No uninitialized or vaguely scoped states allowed.

3. **Deterministic, logically sound, and fully defined control flow:**  
   - All loops and recursive calls must have explicitly clear, reachable, and terminating conditions that prevent infinite loops and do not prematurely exit in a way that causes incorrectness.  
   - All conditional branches must be collectively exhaustive and mutually consistent, covering every logical scenario with no missing or contradictory cases.  
   - No dead or unreachable code that affects correctness.

4. **Perfectly explicit and complete algorithmic logic:**  
   - Every computational step, mutation, arithmetic operation, indexing, or data transformation must be fully described without omission or ambiguity.  
   - No essential step or logic can be vaguely implied, partial, or left to guesswork.  
   - Arithmetic and indexing must be specified such that no underflow, overflow, or off-by-one errors are possible.

5. **Robust boundary and failure case management:**  
   - The pseudocode must demonstrate explicit handling of all boundary conditions (empty inputs, maximum/minimum sizes, zero-length arrays, zero divisions, overflows/underflows).  
   - Explicit checks or fail-safes to prevent runtime errors (index out-of-bounds, null dereferencing, invalid operations, etc.) must be present or logically unavoidable without assumptions.  
   - Error and exceptional input states must be covered completely if applicable.

6. **Deterministic, fully defined output specification:**  
   - Output values, including return values and any intermediate outputs, must be fully spelled out with no ambiguity in format, type, or content.  
   - Exactly as expected according to the problem’s requirements with no omitted formatting or implicit behaviors.

7. **Absolute self-containment:**  
   - The snippet must be entirely implementable *as-is*, without relying on any unstated external context such as hidden functions, library behavior, environment characteristics, or additional initialization steps not written in the pseudocode.  
   - No gaps or missing dependencies to be inferred or filled by the implementer.

8. **Clarity of style and expression must not degrade reproducibility:**  
   - Differences in pseudocode style, structural idioms (loops vs recursion), or naming conventions are allowed only if they preserve full clarity, completeness, and deterministic behavior.  
   - Ambiguous, overly terse, contradictory, or inconsistent expressions that make interpretation uncertain must cause rejection.

**Decision Rule:**  
- Output `1` if and only if *all* the above criteria are strictly met—no ambiguity, no incompleteness, no gaps whatsoever.  
- Output `0` otherwise, including in cases of near completeness, minor omissions, or anything that might cause some unit tests to fail.

**Instructions for your evaluation process:**  
- Systematically verify each snippet against all 8 criteria from input through to output.  
- Do not guess or fill in missing details, even if it seems reasonable or likely.  
- Consider *all conceivable* unit tests for every corner case, invalid input, edge condition, and failure mode relevant to the task implied by the pseudocode.  
- Guard vigilantly against common pitfalls: infinite or incorrect loops/recursion, uninitialized variables, incomplete boundary checking, ambiguous returns, hidden assumptions, and unstated dependencies.  
- Even stylistic or idiomatic constructs must be scrutinized to confirm they do not compromise determinism or completeness.
