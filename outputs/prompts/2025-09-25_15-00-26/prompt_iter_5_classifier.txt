Given the pseudocode below, determine whether it is unequivocally reproducible; that is, whether an implementation based exactly on this pseudocode will pass *all* its intended unit tests without any errors, logical flaws, ambiguities, or missing behaviors. Consider correctness, completeness, clear handling of all edge cases, absence of contradictions or omissions, and unambiguous instructions that enable fully deterministic reproduction of the specified functionality.

- Respond **1** if the pseudocode is fully reproducible according to these criteria.
- Respond **0** if there exists *any* doubt, ambiguity, logical error, incompleteness, or inconsistency that would cause it to fail *any* of its intended unit tests or make its reproduction unreliable.
- Do not output anything other than the sequence of 1s and 0s corresponding exactly *in order* to each pseudocode input provided.
- Rely solely on the analysis of the pseudocode itself, not on assumptions from domain knowledge or external context.
- Carefully evaluate:
  - Initialization and updates of variables and data structures
  - All control flow conditions and loop boundaries
  - Proper handling of edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Explicit and unambiguous operations and returns
  - Consistency in naming, indexing, and data access
  - No implicit or missing steps required for correctness
- Treat variations in formatting, naming, or style as irrelevant as long as the semantics remain clear and unambiguous.
- Consider whether the pseudocode can be directly transformed into a working implementation passing all its unit tests without further interpretation or fixes.

Here is the pseudocode to evaluate:

**Output only a single digit (1 or 0) with no extra text or formatting.**
