Task:  
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each purporting to fully specify a solution to an unspecified computational problem. Your task is to output exactly one digit per snippet following these rules:  

- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode is *strictly fully reproducible*: any faithful, direct, and exact implementation of that pseudocode (without any additions, omissions, or guesswork) will pass **all conceivable unit tests** for *full correctness* across the problem’s entire valid and relevant input domain. This includes normal, boundary, edge, invalid (within problem scope), error, and corner cases.  
- Output `0` otherwise.  

Your output must be a concatenation of these digits in the given input order for all snippets, with no spaces, newlines, or additional characters. Do not output anything else (no explanations, formatting, or comments).

**Definition of fully reproducible pseudocode:**  
A pseudocode snippet qualifies as fully reproducible only if it *unambiguously*, *completely*, and *precisely* defines an algorithm meeting *all* the criteria below without relying on any external assumptions or implicit knowledge:

1. **Comprehensive Input Specification:**  
   - Explicitly delineates the input domain: types, sizes, constraints, and characteristics.  
   - Explicitly clarifies how all *valid* inputs are processed and precisely how *invalid but in-scope* inputs (if any) are handled or rejected within the algorithm itself.  
   - Does *not* assume inputs are pre-validated or sanitized outside the pseudocode scope.  
   - Covers empty, minimal, maximal, zero-length, null or special cases explicitly or logically.  

2. **Complete and Explicit State Definition:**  
   - Fully declares and initializes **all** variables, containers, data structures, flags, counters, indices, accumulators, and temporaries before any use.  
   - Defines data structures’ sizes, contents, and initial states without ambiguity.  
   - Uses no undefined symbols, implicit variables, or external references.  

3. **Deterministic, Total, and Sound Control Flow:**  
   - All loops, conditionals, recursion, and iteration cases are exhaustively covered, including all branches and alternatives.  
   - Loop invariants, progress, and termination conditions are implicitly or explicitly guaranteed, meaning no infinite loops or premature exits that break correctness.  
   - Control flow is logically consistent with no contradictions, conflicts, or unreachable code affecting outcome correctness.  

4. **Precise, Explicit Algorithmic Logic:**  
   - Every step, assignment, mutation, calculation, or comparison is stated explicitly, logically consistent, and sufficient.  
   - No gaps, vague phrases, or ambiguous "implicit" steps or operations.  
   - All arithmetic and indexing operations are well-defined and guarded against boundary errors, overflow, underflow, or invalid memory/state access.  

5. **Comprehensive Edge, Boundary, and Exception Handling:**  
   - Explicitly addresses all boundary conditions, including minimal/maximal values, empty or degenerate inputs, zero divisors, overflows, and underflows where applicable.  
   - Provides safeguards or treatment for exceptional or error conditions that the problem scope requires.  
   - Contains explicit error-handling logic or well-defined behavior for invalid inputs as required or explicitly excludes such inputs.  

6. **Unambiguous, Deterministic Output Definition:**  
   - Outputs (values, formats, types, structures) are perfectly and explicitly defined.  
   - Each output element derives deterministically and explicitly from the algorithm’s internal logic and data states.  
   - Final and intermediate outputs have no uncertainty or alternative interpretations.  

7. **Complete Self-Containment - No External or Implicit Dependencies:**  
   - The pseudocode is fully implementable *as-is* relying exclusively on primitives defined within it or universally understood pseudocode conventions.  
   - Must not rely on external libraries, unspecified language features, environmental states, implicit defaults, or conventions not stated within the snippet itself.  
   - No required inference to fill missing details, definitions, or constraints.  

8. **Clarity, Consistency, and Unambiguous Notation:**  
   - Syntax, naming, and idioms are consistent and clear enough to avoid multiple interpretations.  
   - Avoid excessive terseness, ambiguous wording, conflicting statements, or style-induced ambiguities.  
   - Ambiguities in flow, data state changes, or outputs due to notation or style invalidate reproducibility.  

---

**Evaluation instructions:**  
- Consider *all eight* criteria fully and conservatively for every snippet. If *any* ambiguity, missing information, implicit assumption, incomplete coverage, or logical gap exists that could allow a failing test case, return `0`.  
- Only output `1` if you are fully certain the pseudocode guarantees correctness and reproducibility over the entire input/output domain including edge and corner cases, and fully meets every criterion.  
- Never guess or supply any missing constraints, input assumptions, or hidden steps.  
- Account for subtle pitfalls such as uninitialized variables, incomplete input validation, ambiguous control flow, missing boundary checks, infinite loops, partial coverage of conditional branches, or implicit type/font assumptions.  
- Your assessment must carefully analyze potential edge cases, error handling, bounded computations, and strict output construction.
