Given the pseudocode below, determine **with absolute certainty** whether it is *fully reproducible*.  
*Fully reproducible* means the pseudocode, if directly translated and implemented, would correctly and unambiguously pass **all** of its intended unit tests without error or failure.  

Your evaluation must focus on the correctness, completeness, and explicitness of the instructions in the pseudocode, including but not limited to:  
- Precise handling of all input conditions and edge cases  
- Proper and clear initialization of all variables and data structures before use  
- Correct and complete flow control (loops, conditionals, recursion) with no infinite loops or dead ends  
- Accurate and unambiguous operations reflecting the intended algorithmic logic  
- Correct management of side effects, state mutations, and return values  
- Handling of boundary cases like empty inputs, zero values, or overflow conditions  
- Proper termination conditions for loops and recursion  
- No assumptions that rely on external implicit knowledge or unspecified behavior  

If **all** these criteria are clearly met, output **1**. Otherwise (if any ambiguity, mistake, missing step, or logical flaw that would cause test failures or implementation uncertainty exists), output **0**.  

**Important:**  
- Output must be exactly one digit: either `1` or `0`. No explanations, no additional text.  
- When given multiple pseudocode snippets in sequence, output a sequence of digits in the exact order the pseudocode snippets are provided. Each digit corresponds to each snippetâ€™s reproducibility.  
- Do not guess based on intuition or partial correctness; the decision must reflect absolute confidence that the pseudocode can pass *all* unit tests.  
- Consider pseudocode style variations and cosmetic differences irrelevant if the logic and explicitness remain sound and fully test-passing. Conversely, near misses or partial correctness must be classified as non-reproducible (output `0`).
