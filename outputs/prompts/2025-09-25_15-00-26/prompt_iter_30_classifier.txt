Task:  
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each representing a proposed solution to a computational problem. For each snippet, your output must be exactly one digit:

- Output `1` if the pseudocode is *fully reproducible* — meaning that any direct, faithful implementation of this pseudocode (with no additions, omissions, or inferred details) is guaranteed to pass **all possible unit tests** for correctness. This includes tests covering normal cases, edge cases, boundary conditions, exceptional scenarios, and any invalid or unexpected inputs that fall within the problem’s defined scope.

- Output `0` otherwise.

Concatenate all output digits sequentially in the order the pseudocodes are presented, with no spaces, newlines, or any other characters. Output nothing else — no explanations, no formatting, no commentary.

---

**Strict and exhaustive criteria for *full reproducibility*:**

Your judgment must confirm all of the following for each pseudocode snippet. If *any* criterion is not conclusively met, output `0`.

1. **Complete and explicit input specification**  
   - The input domain, types, sizes, and constraints are unambiguously defined.  
   - Every input variant relevant to correctness—including empty, minimal, maximal, malformed, null-equivalents, and out-of-spec inputs within problem scope—is handled explicitly or logically (e.g., rejected, sanitized, or safely tolerated).  
   - No reliance on implicit assumptions, external input validation, or unspecified preconditions.

2. **Comprehensive state definition and management**  
   - All variables, data structures, and states used in the algorithm are declared, initialized, and described in detail before first use.  
   - Includes sizes, value domains, initial contents, and all intermediate states necessary to ensure correctness.  
   - No reference to undefined, implicit, external, or language-specific constructs or defaults.

3. **Deterministic, complete, and correct control flow**  
   - All loops and recursive calls have clearly defined initialization, progression, and termination conditions ensuring no infinite loops, premature exits, or unhandled iteration cases.  
   - All conditional branches collectively cover *every* logical possibility that could arise at runtime, with no ambiguities, unreachable code, or conflicting states affecting correctness.  
   - The control flow must leave no gaps or dead ends that could produce incomplete, incorrect, or uncertain behavior.

4. **Precise, unambiguous algorithmic logic**  
   - Every operation — including calculations, comparisons, mutations, updates, and data accesses — is specified explicitly, without gaps or vague descriptions.  
   - Arithmetic, indexing, and boundary handling details are fully and clearly described, with respect to data structure sizes and possible value ranges.  
   - No implicit inferences or skipped steps.  
   
5. **Explicit handling of all edge, boundary, and exceptional cases**  
   - Checks for boundary conditions (e.g., empty inputs, minimum/maximum values, zero divisors, overflow/underflow risks) are present and correct.  
   - Error states, invalid input scenarios, or exceptional flows are handled in a clearly defined manner if the problem domain requires it.  
   - The pseudocode protects against illegal runtime conditions (out-of-range accesses, null dereferences, invalid states).

6. **Exact and unambiguous output definition**  
   - Outputs — their values, types, formats, and derivation from the computation — are clearly specified without ambiguity.  
   - No partial, unclear, or underspecified output descriptions.  
   - Output formatting conventions fully described and consistent with problem expectations.

7. **Total self-containment and independence from external context**  
   - The snippet must be entirely self-sufficient, implementable as-is.  
   - No external libraries, language-specific features, runtime environments, or hidden assumptions affecting correctness.  
   - No reliance on unarticulated knowledge, behaviors, or heuristics.

8. **Clarity, consistency, and unambiguous notation**  
   - Pseudocode style, syntax, and idioms are clear and precise, avoiding terse, ambiguous, or inconsistent expressions that could lead to misinterpretation.  
   - Control flow, state changes, and output generation are communicated clearly with logical and semantic completeness.  
   - Any ambiguity in meaning or coverage invalidates reproducibility.

**Evaluation Instructions:**  
- Analyze each pseudocode snippet with extreme rigor applying all the above criteria.  
- If there is *any* doubt, ambiguity, missing detail, or incompleteness introducing even a single conceivable failing unit test scenario, output `0`.  
- Output `1` only if the pseudocode indisputably meets *all* above criteria, guaranteeing every implementation following it will pass all unit tests for full correctness, on all inputs within the problem scope.

---

**Additional guidelines for your judgment:**  
- Do NOT add, infer, guess, or supply missing details or constraints — judge only on what is explicitly presented.  
- Do NOT tolerate implicit assumptions — inputs, environment, or behavior must be fully articulated.  
- Pay special attention to subtle pitfalls such as uninitialized states, unhandled boundary values, ambiguous outputs, infinite loops, partial coverage, or logic gaps.  
- Consider edge cases, erroneous inputs, and complex logical paths equally as typical cases.  
- Reject pseudocode that depends on reader intuition, partial descriptions, or incomplete coverage.
