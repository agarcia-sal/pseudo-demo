Task:  
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets as input. For each snippet, output exactly one digit:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is guaranteed reproducible,  
- `0` otherwise.  

Concatenate all digits in the same order as the input snippets, without spaces, newlines, or any other characters.

**Definition of Reproducible:**  
A pseudocode snippet is reproducible if and only if *any* fully faithful implementation constructed strictly according to the snippet—with zero unstated assumptions, zero external dependencies, and zero interpretative guesswork—will pass **all** unit tests related to its intended specification, including but not limited to: normal cases, edge cases, boundary conditions, invalid and malformed inputs, error states, concurrency or state consistency challenges, and any corner cases reasonably inferable from the problem domain.

### Instructions and Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Complete and Explicit Input Handling:**  
   - The pseudocode must explicitly or logically handle every conceivable valid input, including all edge cases (empty inputs, zero, maximum/minimum boundaries, null or sentinel values, and atypical inputs fitting the problem scope).  
   - It must also explicitly define behavior or safeguards for invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs if these fall within reasonable problem domain expectations.  
   - No reliance on implicit input guarantees or silent assumptions is allowed.

2. **Full and Unambiguous Initialization and State Definition:**  
   - All variables, data structures, state flags, counters, indices, or accumulators must be initialized unambiguously prior to use.  
   - No partially initialized or implicitly scoped elements, no undefined references, no reliance on external environment state.

3. **Deterministic, Complete, and Sound Control Flow:**  
   - All loops, recursions, and conditional branches must have clearly defined start conditions, termination conditions, and exhaustive coverage of relevant logical scenarios.  
   - No infinite loops or recursion unless clearly bounded. No unreachable code that could disrupt correctness.  
   - Control flow must explicitly or logically handle every relevant input/state combination without leaving gaps or logical contradictions.

4. **Explicit, Correct, and Fully Detailed Algorithmic Steps:**  
   - All computational operations, data manipulations, updates, and state transitions must be explicitly described without omissions or vague implications.  
   - No missing intermediate steps that are essential for correctness.  
   - Arithmetic, indexing, data transformations, and logic decisions must be defined unambiguously and correctly.

5. **Robust and Defensible Boundary, Failure, and Exception Handling:**  
   - Explicit handling of boundary conditions (e.g., minimal or maximal sizes, zero-division, overflow/underflow, empty data, or domain-specific conditions).  
   - Safe guards against runtime errors such as out-of-bounds accesses, null dereferences, or undefined behavior.  
   - Explicit error detection, propagation, or recovery as required by the problem domain.

6. **Deterministic, Fully Defined Output Specification:**  
   - Outputs and return values must be precisely specified and faithfully derivable from algorithmic steps.  
   - No ambiguity in output format, content, or meaning.  
   - Consistency with the expected output format of the problem stated or implied.

7. **Zero Reliance on External or Implicit Context:**  
   - The snippet must be fully self-contained and implementable as given, without requiring unstated external functions, hidden constants, environment-specific behaviors, or libraries.  
   - No gaps requiring user, reader, or implementer inference or assumptions beyond the pseudocode text itself.

8. **Clarity and Absence of Ambiguity Due to Style or Idioms:**  
   - The style or idiomatic choices (loop vs recursion, naming, indexing style) do not compromise logical clarity or reproducibility.  
   - Ambiguous, inconsistent, excessively terse, or contradictory style elements that undermine unambiguous understanding invalidate reproducibility.

---

### Critical Evaluation Approach:

- **Be strictly conservative:** Even the smallest ambiguity, incomplete initialization, potential edge case omission, or logical gap that could cause *any* conceivable unit test failure requires output `0`.  
- **Do not infer, fill in, or guess missing details** even if the omission looks trivial or “obvious.”  
- **Consider the broadest realistic set of unit tests** including invalid inputs, exceptional states, boundary extremes, concurrency or state issues if implied.  
- **Ensure the pseudocode guarantees termination where applicable.**

---

### Output Format:

- For multiple pseudocode snippets, output a single, uninterrupted string of digits (`1` or `0`), in the exact order the snippets were presented.  
- Output absolutely nothing else—no spaces, no line breaks, no commentary, no explanations.

### Example invocation format (for clarity only, do not output):  
```
<Your detailed prompt here>

Pseudocode snippet(s):  
```<pseudocode 1>```  
```<pseudocode 2>```  
...
```

Your response:  
`10`  (if first snippet reproducible, second not, for example)

This prompt is designed to reduce false negatives on reproducible pseudocode under variation and cosmetic rewrites, while eliminating false positives caused by near-misses, ambiguous or incomplete snippets. Strict adherence to comprehensive, explicit, and conservative evaluation is paramount for maximal test-time accuracy.
