Task:  
You will be given one or more standalone pseudocode snippets, each purporting to fully and precisely specify a complete algorithmic solution to an unspecified computational problem. For each snippet, output exactly one digit (no spaces, newlines, or other characters):  
- `1` if the pseudocode is *fully reproducible*  
- `0` otherwise  

**Output Rules:**  
- The output digits must be concatenated strictly in the order the pseudocode snippets are presented.  
- Output nothing else besides these digits—no explanations, comments, or formatting.  

---

**Definition of *Fully Reproducible* Pseudocode:**  
A pseudocode snippet is *fully reproducible* if and only if it fulfills *all* the strict criteria below to guarantee any faithful, direct implementation matching this pseudocode exactly (with no additions, omissions, or guesses) will pass **all** unit tests for correctness—including normal cases, edge cases, boundary inputs, invalid inputs (if applicable), and corner cases—*within the intended problem scope*. No assumptions or external clarifications can be required.

---

**Criteria:**  

1. **Complete and Explicit Input Specification:**  
   - Clearly define input types, domains, accepted formats, and constraints.  
   - Handle all valid inputs and expected invalid or out-of-domain inputs explicitly, either by valid processing, error handling, or rejection within the pseudocode.  
   - Never rely on external or implicit input validation assumptions or unstated input sanitization.  

2. **Total Variable and Data Structure Definition:**  
   - Declare and initialize *all* variables and data structures before use, including auxiliary variables, counters, flags, indices, accumulators, temporary storage, and any state.  
   - Specify exact sizes, initial values, and contents where applicable, including data representations and memory layouts if relevant.  
   - Avoid undefined or implicitly initialized data or states.  

3. **Deterministic and Exhaustive Control Flow:**  
   - Fully specify all control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals, switches) with explicit entry, exit, and iteration/recursion invariants, guaranteeing termination without infinite loops (except if intended and explicitly handled).  
   - Cover every possible logical and input case—no missing or ambiguous branches.  
   - Avoid unreachable, conflicting, or contradictory code fragments that may impact correctness or cause ambiguity.  

4. **Precise and Unambiguous Algorithmic Steps:**  
   - Detail every computation, mutation, comparison, decision, and state update explicitly and logically consistent with the intended algorithmic behavior.  
   - No gaps, vague descriptions, or missing operations that require guesswork.  
   - Indexing and arithmetic must be clearly bounded and well-defined (e.g., no out-of-range access).  

5. **Robust Boundary and Exceptional Case Handling:**  
   - Explicitly handle boundary cases such as empty inputs, minimal/maximal input sizes, zero-value inputs, and special numeric or data structure edge values.  
   - Cover failure modes and exceptions (e.g., division by zero, overflow, underflow) where applicable.  
   - Implement safeguards within the pseudocode to avoid undefined or erroneous states, crashes, or infinite loops.  

6. **Explicit and Unambiguous Output Definition:**  
   - Define output values, formats, and data types clearly and completely, in exact correspondence with inputs and internal states.  
   - No ambiguity about output construction, ordering, or format.  
   - Conform output format strictly to problem conventions (e.g., return types, value ordering, data structures).  

7. **Fully Self-Contained with No External Dependencies or Assumptions:**  
   - The snippet must be implementable exactly as given, without depending on external context, unstated language features, implicit environment behaviors, third-party libraries, or hidden state.  
   - All primitives and operations used must be either explicitly defined or universally understood as part of standard pseudocode.  
   - Do *not* accept any “fill-in-the-blanks” or inferred meanings beyond what is stated textually in the snippet.  

8. **Clarity, Consistency, and Formal Precision:**  
   - Syntax and symbols must be used consistently, understandably, and without ambiguity.  
   - Avoid stylistic shortcuts or overly terse expressions that obscure meaning or introduce logical uncertainty.  
   - Ambiguities in control flow, data state changes, indexing, or output invalidate reproducibility.

---

**Analysis Instructions:**  
- Evaluate each pseudocode snippet *conservatively and rigorously* against all eight criteria.  
- If *any* detail is ambiguous, incomplete, unstated, conflicting, or logically insufficient to guarantee passing *all* possible unit tests for correctness, output `0` for that snippet.  
- Output `1` *only if* the pseudocode snippet is exhaustively complete and unambiguous for full correctness on every test scenario within the problem domain.  
- Consider subtle but critical issues such as: uninitialized variables, implicit defaults, missing boundary checks, ambiguous returns, potential infinite loops/recursion, incomplete case coverage, unclear output formats, or hidden dependencies.  
- Do *not* add any own assumptions, fixes, or missing info—even if seeming obvious. The pseudocode must stand utterly alone.

**Example of Inputs:**  
```  
<INSERT_PSEUDOCODE_SNIPPET_1>  
```  
```  
<INSERT_PSEUDOCODE_SNIPPET_2>  
```  
...  

---

**Expected Output:**  
A single string of digits where each digit corresponds exactly to the reproducibility evaluation of the pseudocode snippet in input order (1 = reproducible, 0 = not reproducible), with no spaces, newlines, or other text.
