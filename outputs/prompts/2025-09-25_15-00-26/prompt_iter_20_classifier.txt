Task:  
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each describing an algorithm or function intended to solve a programming problem. For each snippet, output exactly one digit:  
- Output `1` if the pseudocode is *fully reproducible*, meaning any faithful implementation strictly following it, with no external assumptions or guesses, will pass **all** conceivable unit tests for the intended functionality;  
- Output `0` if the pseudocode is *not* fully reproducible, meaning there is any ambiguity, incompleteness, logical gap, or unstated assumption that could cause failure on at least one valid test case.

Concatenate your digits for multiple snippets in the exact input order, with no spaces, newlines, or any additional characters. Output nothing else.

---

**Definition of *fully reproducible* in this context:**  
A pseudocode snippet is fully reproducible if, and only if, **every** correct implementation that strictly follows the pseudocode, without filling in missing details or making external assumptions, would pass **every** meaningful unit test related to its purpose. This includes all normal scenarios, edge and corner cases, boundary conditions, malformed input cases (if within problem scope), error conditions, and any other cases reasonably expected in the problem domain.

---

**Your Evaluation Must Rigorously Confirm Each of the Following 9 Pillars, with Zero Ambiguity or Omission:**

1. **Explicit, Exhaustive Input Handling:**  
   - All valid input types, ranges, and edge conditions (empty inputs, zeros, null/None equivalents, max/min values, invalid/malformed inputs if applicable) are either explicitly handled or logically guaranteed safe.  
   - No implicit assumptions about input correctness or constraints not stated in pseudocode.

2. **Complete and Clear Variable and State Initialization:**  
   - Every variable, data structure, accumulator, flag, index, or helper state is explicitly declared and initialized before first use.  
   - No undefined, uninitialized, or ambiguously scoped variables or states.

3. **Deterministic, Exhaustive Control Flow Coverage:**  
   - All loops, recursion, and conditional branches have explicit, reachable, and terminating/covering conditions.  
   - No infinite loops without exit conditions; no missing or partial case coverage; no dead or contradictory code affecting correctness.  
   - Control structures collectively cover every relevant input and intermediate state.

4. **Unambiguous, Correct Algorithmic Logic Without Gaps:**  
   - Each computational step, data mutation, or update is explicitly detailed and logically consistent.  
   - No essential algorithmic steps omitted or vaguely implied.  
   - Arithmetic, indexing, transformations, and decisions are clearly specified and well-defined.

5. **Complete Boundary, Special Case, and Failure Condition Handling:**  
   - Explicit handling or safe logical coverage of boundary inputs, empty data structures, zero-division, overflow/underflow, empty or unusual outputs, invalid inputs (if required), and any domain-specific edge cases.  
   - Proper safeguards against undefined behavior, out-of-range accesses, and runtime errors.

6. **Precisely Specified and Consistent Output Definition:**  
   - Output values (including intermediate and final) are fully defined and deterministically derived.  
   - No ambiguity in output format, type, or content relative to the problem's specification.

7. **Strict Self-Containment Without Reliance on External Context:**  
   - The snippet must be interpretable and implementable *as-is*, with no unstated dependencies on environment, language specifics, external functions, libraries, or undocumented mechanisms.  
   - No gaps or references forcing assumptions beyond the snippet.

8. **Clear, Unambiguous Pseudocode Style and Terminology:**  
   - Variations in pseudocode style, naming, or idioms are acceptable *only if* they maintain precise clarity, allow fully faithful implementations, and avoid any ambiguity in logic or data flow.  
   - Overly terse, inconsistent, or ambiguous expressions that impair faithful implementation are not acceptable.

9. **Robustness Against Logical, Semantic, and Implementation Pitfalls:**  
   - The pseudocode must preclude infinite recursion or loops, race conditions, order-dependent side effects, and ambiguous timing or state updates.  
   - No hidden assumptions about language-specific integer sizes, indexing bases, or runtime behavior unless explicitly stated.

---

**Decision Rule:**  
- Output `1` if and only if **all 9 pillars are fully met without any ambiguity, incompleteness, or assumption**.  
- Output `0` otherwise, including if the pseudocode is nearly complete but leaves even one possible failing test case, hidden condition, or unclear instruction.

---

**Additional Guidelines for Your Assessment:**  
- Do **not** guess missing details or infer constraints not stated or logically derivable from the pseudocode.  
- Conduct a thorough, step-by-step logical review of control flow, state changes, boundary handling, and output formatting.  
- Consider *all* conceivable unit tests based on normal behavior, edge, corner, invalid or malformed inputs consistent with the problem scope.  
- Guard rigorously against common failure modes including but not limited to:  
  - Undefined or uninitialized variables or data elements  
  - Missing loop or recursion termination conditions  
  - Ambiguous or partial condition coverage in control flow  
  - Incomplete or unclear output specification  
  - Reliance on unstated external functions or context  
  - Implicit assumptions about input validity, structure, or environment  
  - Logical contradictions or gaps in algorithmic steps  

---

**Output Format Reminder:**  
For **N** snippets, output a single string of N digits (`1` or `0`), strictly preserving the input snippet order, without spaces, line breaks, or any other characters.
