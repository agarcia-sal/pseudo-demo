Task:  
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets. For each snippet, output a single digit: `1` if the snippet is **fully reproducible**, or `0` if it is not.  
Output only the concatenated sequence of digits, corresponding exactly in order to the input snippets, with no spaces, line breaks, or any other characters or explanations.

Definition of *fully reproducible*:  
A pseudocode snippet is *fully reproducible* if and only if **every possible faithful, direct implementation strictly following the snippet—without any external assumptions, guesswork, or unspecified details—will pass all conceivable unit tests for its intended behavior**.  
This includes tests over all normal cases, edge cases, boundary values, error scenarios, invalid inputs (if applicable), and any corner or atypical cases relevant or reasonably expected from the problem domain.

Your evaluation must be *strict, precise, and conservative*. Even one single logical gap, ambiguity, omission, or unstated assumption that could cause any failing or undefined behavior must lead to output `0`.

Instructions for evaluating EACH pseudocode snippet:

1. **Complete and explicit input specification and validation**  
   - Confirm that all relevant input forms and values—including empty inputs, zeros, null-equivalents, min/max values, special characters, invalid or malformed inputs (if within problem scope)—are either explicitly handled or logically ensured by the snippet itself without relying on outside guarantees.  
   - No silent assumptions about input validity or constraints allowed.

2. **Clear and comprehensive state declaration and initialization**  
   - Every variable, list, array, flag, counter, state element, or data structure must be explicitly declared and initialized before use with no ambiguity or potential undefined references.  
   - Confirm no uninitialized or partially initialized states that could affect correctness.

3. **Deterministic, logically complete, and fully accounted control flow**  
   - All loops, recursion, and conditional branches must have clearly defined, reachable entry and exit conditions. Confirm no risk of infinite loops, premature exits, dead or unreachable code that might break correctness, or early returns that skip necessary processing.  
   - Every conditional must exhaustively and unambiguously cover all logical possibilities related to the input and intermediate states (no missing branches or partial coverage).  
   - Recursive calls or repeated structures should be clearly bounded and terminate properly under all circumstances.

4. **Explicit, unambiguous, and logically consistent algorithmic steps**  
   - Each computational step, update, and intermediate transformation must be fully specified, with no vague instructions or implicit steps left to inference or guess.  
   - Algorithmic logic should reflect the intended solution clearly, with no missing or implicit essential steps.  
   - Arithmetic, indexing, data transformations, and control must be precisely defined and consistent throughout.

5. **Robust boundary, error, and special case handling**  
   - Check all domain boundaries thoroughly (empty inputs, minimal and maximal sizes, zero or special values, out-of-range indexing, divide-by-zero, possible overflow or underflow conditions, empty outputs, and other corner cases).  
   - Confirm that the snippet contains explicit safeguards or clearly logically inevitable protections to avoid undefined or erroneous states on these boundaries.  
   - Proper handling of invalid inputs or error conditions is required if these fall within problem domain expectations.

6. **Deterministic and fully specified output formation**  
   - The output or return value(s) must be clearly and precisely defined in format, type, and content as derived from the algorithm's prior computations.  
   - No ambiguous, partial, or underspecified outputs allowed.  
   - Output must be consistent with the intent and problem specification.

7. **Absolute self-containment and independence**  
   - The snippet must be fully implementable as-is, without requiring unstated external context, external functions, language-specific behaviors, hidden environment assumptions, implicit library calls, or missing definitional details.  
   - No implicit knowledge beyond the snippet’s self-contained content should be needed to fully describe its behavior.

8. **Clarity of expression and absence of ambiguity in pseudocode style**  
   - Variations in style, idiomatic expressions, or formatting are acceptable only if they maintain full clarity, precision, and unambiguity in logic, control flow, and state management.  
   - Terse, shorthand, ambiguous, or inconsistent styles that cause divergent interpretations or gaps disqualify reproducibility.  
   - Ensure indexing, notation, and naming are consistent and unambiguous.

---

**Decision rule:**  
- If **all eight criteria are met fully, unambiguously, and without any logical gap or unstated assumption**, output `1`.  
- If **any single criterion is not met or is ambiguous, incomplete, or potentially inconsistent**, output `0`.

---

**Additional critical assessment guidelines:**

- Do **not** fill in missing details even if they seem reasonable or typical; lack of explicit specification counts as failure.  
- Do **not** assume or infer constraints unless explicitly stated or logically guaranteed by the snippet itself.  
- Rigorously imagine all conceivable unit tests—including edge, corner, invalid, and stress cases—and confirm the snippet’s correctness and safety under all.  
- Verify absence of silent failure modes: infinite loops/recursions, undefined variable usage, out-of-bound accesses, ill-defined outputs, or partial computations.  
- Confirm that every variable/element used is properly initialized before reference.  
- Confirm every control path—even less likely paths—are well-defined and terminate correctly.  
- Confirm output is precisely constructed from prior states, in a format consistent with the problem statement.  
- Confirm no external or environmental assumptions are needed.

---

Output format reminder:  
- Produce a single string of digits composed of only `1` or `0` for each snippet, concatenated **in the exact order snippets are given**.  
- Output nothing else — no explanations, no whitespace, no newlines.
