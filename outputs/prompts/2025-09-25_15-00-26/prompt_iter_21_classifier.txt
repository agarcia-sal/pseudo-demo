Task:  
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets. For each snippet, output a single digit — `1` if the pseudocode is **guaranteed fully reproducible**, or `0` otherwise.  
Output only the concatenated sequence of digits in input order with no spaces, newlines, or any additional characters.

**Definition of *fully reproducible*:**  
A pseudocode snippet is *fully reproducible* if and only if **any faithful implementation strictly following it, with no external assumptions or unstated details, will pass every conceivable unit test for the problem’s full input and output domain**, including normal cases, boundary conditions, error and invalid input handling, and corner cases — without failure, undefined behavior, or ambiguity.

---

**Instructions for evaluation:**  
Assess each snippet under the strictest standards below. If *any* aspect is incomplete, ambiguous, undefined, or logically insufficient—even if it passes most tests—output `0`. Only output `1` where the snippet meets **all** criteria with absolute certainty.

---

**Key Evaluation Criteria (all must be fully satisfied):**

1. **Explicit and exhaustive input domain handling**  
   - All valid inputs (types, ranges, formats, and boundary cases such as empty input, zeros, special characters, maximum/minimum values) are explicitly considered or their handling is logically unavoidable.  
   - Any potential invalid or malformed inputs within the problem scope are either prevented or explicitly managed.  
   - No implicit promises about input cleanliness or constraints not stated in the snippet.

2. **Complete and explicit variable and state initialization**  
   - Every variable, data structure, flag, index, accumulator, or helper value is explicitly declared and initialized before use without ambiguity.  
   - No usage of undefined or partially defined variables, no hidden or assumed initial values.

3. **Deterministic, logically sound, and fully covered control flow**  
   - All loops, recursion, and branches have clear, reachable, and terminating conditions, preventing infinite loops or premature/incorrect exits.  
   - Branch conditions collectively cover all input and intermediate states without gaps or contradictions.  
   - No unreachable, dead, contradictory, or partially defined control paths that affect correctness.

4. **Complete, unambiguous algorithmic logic**  
   - Every computational step, update, or mutation is thoroughly and explicitly described with no logical gaps, contradictions, or missing essential details.  
   - Arithmetic operations, indexing, data transformations, and logic decisions are stated clearly and consistently.  
   - The overall algorithmic approach fully captures the functionality intended, without leaving steps implicit or suggested.

5. **Explicit boundary and error condition management**  
   - Boundary cases—including minimal and maximal input lengths, empty cases, zero-division prevention, overflow/underflow checks, empty or special outputs—are specifically handled or guaranteed by logic.  
   - Invalid, exceptional, or error states are clearly addressed if relevant to the problem scope (e.g. invalid input, failure returns).  
   - No reliance on external environmental or language-specific error handling.

6. **Deterministic, fully specified output**  
   - The output or return values are precisely defined with no ambiguity about format, type, or computation.  
   - Output construction relies solely on declared states and computations in the snippet; no unspecified formatting or external state.  
   - Output is guaranteed consistent and reproducible for the same input under the snippet’s logic.

7. **Absolute self-containment**  
   - The snippet contains all necessary declarations, definitions, and logic needed to implement it exactly as is, with no references to hidden or external context, undefined external calls, or assumptions about libraries, language features, or external environment.  
   - No placeholder calls, incomplete abstractions, or gaps requiring guesswork or external knowledge.

8. **Clarity preserving style and idiomatic constructs**  
   - Pseudocode style (loops vs recursion, indexing style, naming) is allowed to vary but must maintain logical clarity and completeness.  
   - No overly terse, ambiguous, or inconsistent styling that would permit multiple conflicting interpretations.

---

**Decision Approach:**  
- Carefully **analyze all facets** of the snippet according to the criteria above.  
- **Output `1` if and only if absolutely all 8 criteria are met without exception or uncertainty.**  
- Otherwise, output `0`.

---

**Additional Notes:**  
- **Do not infer, supplement, or guess missing elements**, even if the missing detail seems reasonable or typical.  
- **Do not shortcut analysis:** consider all possible inputs, edge cases, and failure modes carefully.  
- Treat nearly perfect or "almost correct" snippets as non-reproducible if any minor gap exists.  
- **Do not output anything other than the digit sequence** (no spaces, no explanations, no newlines).
