Task:
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets. For each snippet, output a single digit — `1` if the pseudocode is fully reproducible, or `0` otherwise.  
Output only the sequence of digits (one per snippet), concatenated exactly in input order, with no spaces, newlines, or any other characters.

Definition of *fully reproducible*:  
A pseudocode snippet is considered *fully reproducible* if **any faithful implementation strictly following the snippet, with no external assumptions, unstated details, or guesswork, will pass every possible unit test related to its intended functionality** — including all normal cases, edge cases, boundary conditions, error handling, invalid input scenarios, and any atypical or corner cases implied or reasonably expected from the problem domain.

Key instructions:  
- Do **not** infer or assume any missing details, implicit constraints, or unstated initializations.  
- Do **not** overlook ambiguous, partial, or incomplete logic, control flow, or state definitions.  
- Be rigorously conservative: if there is *any* uncertainty, incompleteness, or logical gap that could cause failure or unpredictable behavior in *any* conceivable unit test, output `0`.  
- Cosmetic differences, stylistic variations, or idiomatic pseudocode constructs should **not** influence your judgment unless they introduce ambiguity or incompleteness in logic, initialization, or output.

Rigorous Criteria Checklist: For EACH snippet, verify all these with zero ambiguity or omission:

1. **Explicit and comprehensive input handling**  
   - All valid input types, ranges, and edge cases (empty inputs, zeros, null-equivalents, min/max values, special characters, unusual or boundary conditions, etc.) are explicitly addressed or logically inevitably handled without unstated assumptions.  
   - No reliance on implicit input guarantees, nor ignoring possible malformed or unexpected inputs if they fall within the problem scope.

2. **Complete and clear state initialization and definition**  
   - Every variable, structure, and state element is properly declared and initialized before use, with no undefined or ambiguously scoped references.  
   - Includes any data structures, accumulators, flags, indices, counters, or helper state.

3. **Deterministic, logically sound, and fully covered control flow**  
   - All loops and recursion have clear, reachable, and terminating conditions that prevent infinite loops or premature exits that break correctness.  
   - All conditional branches collectively cover every logical scenario; no missing cases, no contradictions, no unreachable or dead code that interferes with correctness.  
   - Control structures (if/switch/while/for/recursion) must explicitly or implicitly handle all relevant input and intermediate states.

4. **Complete, unambiguous, and correct algorithmic logic**  
   - Each computational step, state update, and mutation is explicitly detailed, with no logical contradictions or gaps.  
   - The intended algorithm is thoroughly captured — no essential steps omitted or vaguely implied.  
   - Arithmetic operations, indexing, data transformations, and logical decisions must be clearly stated and consistent.

5. **Robust handling of boundaries, special cases, and failure modes**  
   - Explicit attention to boundary conditions such as minimal/maximal input sizes, zero-length structures, zero-division, overflow/underflow, empty outputs, or domain-specific corner cases.  
   - Proper checks or safeguards to avoid undefined behavior, out-of-bounds accesses, or runtime errors.  
   - Clear handling of error states, invalid inputs, or exceptional conditions if the problem domain requires it.

6. **Fully specified, deterministic output construction**  
   - Outputs and return values (including intermediate and final) are precisely defined and deterministically derived from prior steps.  
   - No ambiguity about what is returned, how outputs are formed, or their format.  
   - Consistent with the problem statement's expected output type and format.

7. **Absolute self-containment with no reliance on unstated external context**  
   - The snippet must be interpretable and implementable *as-is*, with no hidden assumptions about external functions, language-specific behavior, environment, libraries, or data.  
   - No gaps requiring the reader or implementer to fill in missing details or to infer unstated mechanisms.

8. **Style, formatting, or pseudocode idioms must not threaten clarity or reproducibility**  
   - Variations in pseudocode expression—such as loops vs recursion, array indexing style, or naming conventions—are acceptable *only if* they maintain full clarity and completeness logically.  
   - Ambiguous, overly terse, or inconsistent style causing misunderstanding or interpretative differences disqualify reproducibility.

Decision rule:  
- Output `1` if and only if **all** the above 8 criteria are fulfilled completely and without any ambiguity or omission.  
- Output `0` otherwise, including near-perfect but imperfect snippets that risk failing some test case.

Output format:  
- For multiple snippets, output a single string of digits (`1` or `0`), directly concatenated in the same sequence as input.  
- Output nothing else — no explanations, comments, whitespace, or other characters.

Additional rigor notes:  
- Do **not** guess or fill missing information even if it seems reasonable.  
- Do **not** shortcut detailed logical evaluation of control flow, state initialization, or boundary checks.  
- Consider *all* conceivable unit tests for correctness: edge cases, extremes, unusual inputs, error conditions, and invalid inputs consistent with problem scope.  
- Guard against common pitfalls such as infinite recursion/loops, uninitialized variables, incomplete boundary checks, ambiguous return definitions, implicit assumptions, and unstated dependencies.
