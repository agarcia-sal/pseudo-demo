Given the intricacies revealed by the evaluation (confusions around near-miss and cosmetic versions and subtleties of correctness), a more robust, explicit, and methodical prompt is needed—one that guides the reasoning step-by-step, doesn't allow short ambiguous answers, weighs structural and semantic clarity, and insists on decisive reproducibility judgments based on correctness against *all* possible unit tests.

---

**Here is the improved, detailed, and principled prompt:**

---

**Prompt:**

You will be provided with one or more pieces of pseudocode, each representing a solution to a programming problem. For each pseudocode snippet, determine if it is *fully reproducible*, meaning that it can **correctly and unambiguously pass all its intended unit tests without any failure or ambiguity**. A pseudocode is reproducible only if:

- Its logic is complete and consistent for *all valid inputs* as defined or implied by the code,
- There are no ambiguities or contradictions in the instructions,
- It handles all edge cases and boundary conditions correctly,
- It uses well-defined and implementable operations without undefined behavior,
- It clearly defines all variables and control flows, and
- The output it produces corresponds exactly to the problem specification it intends to solve, guaranteeing full correctness.

Your goal is to verify reproducibility solely from the pseudocode provided, *not* from any external assumptions or language-specific semantics.

---

**Instructions for your evaluation:**

1. Carefully analyze every step, loop, conditional, data structure, and operation described.
2. Consider input coverage, boundary and edge cases, variable initialization, and termination conditions.
3. Check for any logical or conceptual errors that would cause the pseudocode to fail any unit test aimed at typical or corner cases.
4. If the pseudocode meets *all* the above reproducibility conditions and passes a thorough logical correctness inspection, output **1** for that snippet.
5. Otherwise, output **0**.
6. Output a single integer (0 or 1) per pseudocode snippet, in the order they are given.
7. Output *nothing else*—no explanations, no additional text, just a sequence of 0s and 1s corresponding to the pseudocode inputs received.

---

**Format:**

Pseudocode:  
```<INSERT_PSEUDOCODE_HERE>```

Output: 1 or 0

---

**Example scenarios:**

- Pseudocode that clearly specifies every step, contains all necessary edge case handling, and corresponds perfectly to a well-known algorithm that passes comprehensive tests: output **1**.
- Pseudocode that is missing initialization, skips handling empty input, or contains ambiguous steps that would fail or be undefined on some inputs: output **0**.
- Pseudocode that almost works but fails some boundary tests or halts prematurely: output **0**.
- Pseudocode that is superficially different from a known working version but logically equivalent and complete: output **1**.

---

**Important:** You must prioritize correctness and completeness of the solution as per the pseudocode itself, not partial correctness or heuristic similarity to known algorithms.

---

By following these detailed evaluation principles, your output will reflect an accurate, reproducibility-focused binary classification for each pseudocode snippet provided.
