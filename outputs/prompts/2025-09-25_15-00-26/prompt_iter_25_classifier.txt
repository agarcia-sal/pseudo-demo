Task:  
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each purporting to fully define the logic of a solution to an unspecified computational problem. For each snippet, output exactly one digit:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is *completely reproducible*, meaning **any faithful implementation strictly and directly following this pseudocode—without adding, removing, inferring, or guessing any details—will pass every conceivable unit test** verifying full correctness under the entire problem domain, encompassing typical, edge, boundary, error, invalid, and corner cases.  
- `0` otherwise.  

Output format:  
- Output all digits concatenated in the same order as the input snippets appear.  
- Do not include any spaces, newlines, formatting, explanations, or additional text. Only output the digit string.

**Definition of Complete Reproducibility:**  
A pseudocode snippet is fully reproducible *only if* it *unambiguously* and *exhaustively* specifies a correct algorithm that guarantees the following:  

1. **Precise and Comprehensive Input Specification**  
   - Clearly and exactly defines input types, domains, and constraints, without leaving assumptions unstated.  
   - Explicitly handles or rejects **all** valid inputs *and* any in-scope invalid or unexpected inputs, including empty, minimal, maximal, malformed, or boundary-value inputs.  
   - Does not rely on any external input validation; input assumptions must be embedded in the pseudocode itself.  

2. **Explicit and Complete Variable and Data Structure Declaration**  
   - Every variable, array, or data structure is declared, typed (conceptually), sized, and initialized before use.  
   - No variables may be left implicitly initialized or undefined.  
   - All state and auxiliary storage required for correctness must be fully and precisely described.

3. **Deterministic, Well-Defined, and Thorough Control Flow**  
   - All control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals, switches) must have clear, unambiguous entry, progress, and termination conditions, ruling out infinite loops or premature exits that jeopardize correctness.  
   - Every branch for all possible conditions must be covered; no logical gaps or ambiguities allowed.  
   - No contradictory, unreachable, or undefined behavioral branches should exist that affect outcome.

4. **Complete, Accurate, and Unambiguous Logical and Computational Steps**  
   - All computational steps, calculations, mutations, and decision points are spelled out explicitly and logically consistent with intended functionality.  
   - Arithmetic, indexing, comparisons, and other operations are clearly defined, respecting data boundaries and types.  
   - No vague statements, missing operations, or implicit assumptions exist.

5. **Robust Handling of Boundaries, Edge Cases, and Exceptional Conditions**  
   - Explicit checks for boundary cases (empty inputs, zero or maximal values, overflows, underflows, zero divisors, etc.) must be present and handled to prevent undefined behaviors.  
   - Includes error handling, alternative flows, or graceful rejection for any exceptional or invalid input scenarios within domain scope.  

6. **Precise and Deterministic Output Definition**  
   - Output format, structure, and contents are explicitly specified and unambiguously derived from prior computations.  
   - No assumptions or ambiguities exist about final or intermediate outputs’ form or meaning.

7. **Total Self-Containment With No Hidden Dependencies or Assumptions**  
   - The pseudocode can be implemented exactly as given, relying only on explicitly defined constructs or universally standard pseudocode primitives.  
   - Does not depend on external libraries, implicit environment behaviors, language-specific features, global state, or any unstated context.  
   - No filler or assumptions required from the implementer; every detail necessary for correct implementation is included.

8. **Clarity, Consistency, and Unambiguous Notation and Style**  
   - Syntax and semantic idioms are clear and consistent throughout.  
   - Ambiguities caused by terse notation, inconsistent terminology, or conflicting expressions invalidate reproducibility.  
   - Style variations are allowed only if they preserve complete semantic clarity and logical rigor.

**Evaluation Instructions:**  
- Analyze each snippet with maximal rigor and conservatism against *all* the above criteria—interpret every ambiguity, omission, or minor inconsistency as a failure to guarantee reproducibility.  
- Consider the *full spectrum* of possible unit tests, including *all normal, edge, corner, incorrect, and boundary inputs* relevant to the problem scope.  
- Return `0` upon encountering *any* uncertainty, ambiguity, incompleteness, logical flaw, or missing detail that could cause *any* faithful implementation to fail *any* unit test.  
- Return `1` *only if* the snippet *completely satisfies* all criteria, ensuring guaranteed pass of *all* valid and relevant unit tests under exact faithful implementation.  
- Do *not* infer or supply missing assumptions, constraints, or validations—even if they seem obvious.  
- Do *not* tolerate reliance on external validation, implicit environment behavior, or hidden context.  
- Detect and disallow subtle unreproducibility risks: uninitialized state, implicit defaults, missed boundary checks, ambiguous control flow, infinite looping, dangling conditions, partial logic coverage, or unclear output specification.

**Example:**  
If you receive:  
```<INSERT_PSEUDOCODE_HERE>```  
Output must be a single digit `1` or `0` according to the above rules.  

---

**Summary:**  
Your goal is to *distill and formalize* the reproducibility verification of arbitrary pseudocode *in a strictly binary manner*, ensuring high precision in detecting whether the snippet can be implemented *as-is* to pass *all* unit tests *without guesswork*.  

Your output must be exactly one string of digits (0/1), one digit per snippet in input order, with no additional characters or formatting.
