Task:  
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets. For each snippet, output a single digit:  
- `1` if the snippet is *strictly fully reproducible*, i.e., any faithful direct implementation of it (with no external assumptions or guesswork) will pass **all** unit tests for its intended functionality.  
- `0` otherwise.  

Output only the concatenated sequence of digits for all snippets, in the exact input order, with **no spaces, newlines, or any other characters**.

---

**Definition of Strict Full Reproducibility:**  
A pseudocode snippet is *fully reproducible* only if it guarantees passing every conceivable unit test for its intended purpose, **including all normal, edge, boundary, invalid, and corner cases**, without relying on any external, implicit, or assumed context.

---

**Rigorous Evaluation Instructions:**  

For each snippet, rigorously check the following criteria **with zero tolerance for ambiguity, incompleteness, or implicit assumptions**. If *any* criterion is not fully met **without doubt**, output `0`. Only output `1` if **all** of the following are conclusively true:

1. **Complete and explicit input handling:**  
   - All inputs, valid or invalid (including empty, zero, null-equivalents, maximum/minimum possible values, special characters, or unexpected types if in-scope), are explicitly handled or logically guaranteed to be handled correctly.  
   - No assumptions that inputs conform to unstated constraints; malformed inputs are addressed if the problem domain includes them.

2. **Explicit state initialization and declaration:**  
   - Every variable, data structure, and state element is clearly declared and initialized before use.  
   - No use of variables or structures that might be undefined, ambiguous, or externally injected.

3. **Deterministic and logically sound control flow:**  
   - All loops and recursion have well-defined start, progress, and guaranteed termination to prevent infinite execution or premature exits causing incorrect results.  
   - All conditional branches cover all possible logical cases, with no missing or contradictory branches, and no unreachable code that alters correctness.  
   - Control structures explicitly or unmistakably cover every possible input scenario and intermediate state.

4. **Explicit, complete algorithmic logic reflecting the intended problem solution:**  
   - Every significant algorithmic step—calculations, updates, mutations—is clearly and unambiguously described.  
   - No essential operations or steps omitted or vaguely implied.  
   - Arithmetic, indexing, data transformations, and logical decisions are consistent and free from contradictions.

5. **Strict boundary and corner case management:**  
   - Edge situations (e.g., empty inputs, zero-length arrays, minimum/maximum boundaries, zero-division risks, overflow/underflow possibilities) are explicitly considered and correctly handled or logically impossible to fail.  
   - Error states, invalid inputs, or exceptional scenarios pertinent to problem scope have clear, explicit handling.

6. **Deterministic and fully specified output construction:**  
   - Outputs and return values (including intermediate outputs if relevant) are fully defined in format, content, and behavior with no ambiguity.  
   - Output formats and types strictly conform to problem requirements without contextual assumptions.

7. **Absolute self-containment, with no dependencies on unstated external context:**  
   - The snippet is implementable exactly as-is with no reliance on external functions, language-specific features, environment side-effects, or unspecified libraries.  
   - No details left to the implementer’s discretion or guesswork; all necessary information is present.

8. **Clarity and unambiguity in expression and style:**  
   - Stylistic choices, pseudocode idioms, and formatting variations are acceptable **only if** they do not introduce any interpretive uncertainty or gaps in logic.  
   - Overly terse, ambiguous, or inconsistent styles that hinder precise implementation disqualify reproducibility.

---

**Decision:**  
- Output `1` only if **all** above 8 points are fully satisfied with no gaps or ambiguity.  
- Output `0` otherwise, including in cases that are nearly complete but contain any uncertainty or possibility of incorrect behavior.

---

**Additional strict mandates:**  
- Do **not** infer, fill in, or guess any missing information or assumptions—even if plausible.  
- Do **not** shortcut detailed logical analysis of control flow, initialization, boundary checks, or output correctness.  
- Consider **all** conceivable unit tests: all normal, edge, corner, invalid, and error cases consistent with problem scope.  
- Explicitly guard against common implementation pitfalls: infinite loops/recursion, uninitialized usage, incomplete branches, ambiguous outputs, hidden dependencies, and boundary failures.

---

**Output format reminder:**  
- For multiple snippets, output a single concatenated string of `1` and `0` digits in input order.  
- Output nothing else—no whitespace, no newlines, no punctuation, no explanations.
