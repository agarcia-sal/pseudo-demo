Task Description:  
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each purporting to fully define the logic of a complete algorithm for an unspecified computational problem. For each snippet, output exactly one digit only:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is *fully reproducible* — that is, if **any faithful implementation created directly and strictly following every element of this pseudocode (without adding, omitting, or inferring any detail) will correctly pass every conceivable unit test for full correctness**. This includes normal, boundary, edge, invalid, exceptional, and corner cases within the problem’s scope.  
- `0` otherwise.  

Output Format:  
- Concatenate the output digits in the exact input order of the pseudocode snippets, with no spaces, line breaks, or extra characters.  
- Output nothing else — no explanations, no formatting, no whitespace.  

Strict Definition of *Fully Reproducible*:  
A pseudocode snippet qualifies as fully reproducible *only if* it satisfies rigorously and completely all these eight criteria:

1. **Explicit and Complete Input Specification**  
   - Fully defines input domain, types, constraints, limits, and valid value ranges without relying on reader assumptions.  
   - Explicitly enumerates or logically covers all valid inputs, including empty, minimal, maximal, and boundary cases.  
   - Addresses expected invalid/malformed inputs *within the problem scope*, either by explicit handling or by defining their exclusion.  
   - Does **not** assume input validity implicitly or rely on external validation.

2. **Comprehensive Variable and Data Structure Declaration**  
   - Declares all variables, parameters, data structures, and their types or forms upfront or clearly at first use.  
   - Specifies initialization values explicitly; no use of undefined, implicitly defaulted, or externally scoped variables.  
   - Details sizes and contents of arrays, lists, matrices, maps, or other aggregates where applicable.

3. **Deterministic, Exhaustive, and Sound Control Flow**  
   - All loops, recursion, conditionals, and case selections have explicitly stated and unambiguous entry, continuation, and termination criteria that guarantee progress and prevent infinite loops or premature termination unless correct.  
   - Conditionals exhaustively cover all possible input/intermediate states, with no missing or ambiguous branches.  
   - Control flow paths are logically consistent with no unreachable, conflicting, or contradictory code blocks that could alter correctness or cause ambiguity.

4. **Precise, Unambiguous, and Complete Algorithmic Steps**  
   - Each computational step (assignments, updates, arithmetic, comparisons, mutations) is fully specified, logically consistent, and captures the intended procedure without gaps.  
   - Indexing, arithmetic expressions, and boundary conditions are clearly defined and respect data structure bounds.  
   - No vague descriptions, omissions, or essential operations left unspecified or deferred to implementation guesswork.

5. **Explicit Handling of Boundary, Edge, and Exceptional Cases**  
   - All relevant boundary values (e.g., smallest/largest inputs, empty collections, zero or special values) are tested, checked, and handled explicitly or logically.  
   - Includes safeguards against undefined behaviors (e.g., division by zero, out-of-range access, null references).  
   - Specifies error handling or graceful alternatives for invalid or exceptional inputs if applicable.

6. **Exact, Deterministic, and Fully Specified Output**  
   - Defines output type(s), format(s), and structure(s) precisely and unambiguously.  
   - Output values and forms are clearly derived solely from previous computation steps.  
   - No ambiguity or optionality in output formatting, encoding, or meaning.

7. **Self-Containment and Zero External Dependencies**  
   - The snippet is entirely self-sufficient; contains all needed declarations, operations, and decisions.  
   - Does not rely on external libraries, environment assumptions, language-specific behaviors, or unstated knowledge.  
   - Implementation can be performed strictly adhering to the pseudocode without adding or inferring missing logic or context.

8. **Clarity, Consistency, and Precision of Notation**  
   - Pseudocode uses clear, consistent, and precise notation and terminology, with well-defined semantics.  
   - Style variations are allowed only if they preserve complete logical clarity and remove ambiguity.  
   - Ambiguity, contradictions, or inconsistencies arising from style or notation invalidate reproducibility.

Evaluation Protocol — How to Decide Output for Each Snippet:  
- Thoroughly analyze the snippet against *all eight criteria* above without exception.  
- If the pseudocode meets **each and every one** of these criteria rigorously and completely, output `1`.  
- If **any doubt, ambiguity, missing detail, incompleteness, or potential for test failure** exists, output `0`.  
- Do **not** guess missing information or relax specifications based on intuition or typical interpretations.  
- Consider all conceivable unit tests, including edge, boundary, invalid, and unforeseen cases relevant to the problem scope.

Additional Guidance (Strict):  
- Treat even subtle or indirect omissions as grounds for `0`. For example: uninitialized variables, incomplete input domain definitions, unspecified boundary conditions, partial control flow coverage, or tolerance of implicit assumptions.  
- Explicitly confirm termination conditions for all loops and recursion.  
- Confirm outputs are clearly derived and fully defined for *all* possible input scenarios.  
- Do not accept pseudocode that depends on default language-specific features (e.g., automatic zero-initialization, implicit type conversions, external environmental state).  
- Remain conservative and strict: favor `0` if any uncertainty exists.
