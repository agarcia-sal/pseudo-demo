Task: You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets. For each snippet, you must determine **with complete and unquestionable certainty** if the pseudocode is *fully reproducible*. Output `1` if it is, or `0` if it is not. Output only digits, concatenated in order of the input snippets, with no spaces, newlines, or any other characters.

Definition:  
A pseudocode snippet is *fully reproducible* if an implementation strictly following it — without any external assumptions, additions, or guesswork — would **pass all conceivable unit tests** designed for its functionality, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, error situations, input variations, and atypical scenarios.

You must perform a rigorous evaluation against these eight **non-negotiable** verification pillars for each snippet:

1. **Explicit and exhaustive input handling**  
   - All valid inputs, including edge cases (empty inputs, zero, null-equivalents, max/min values, special characters where relevant) are explicitly managed or correctly accounted for.  
   - No reliance on implicit input constraints or hidden prerequisites.

2. **Complete initialization and definition of state**  
   - Every variable, data structure, or state element is declared and initialized **before** any use.  
   - No references to undefined, uninitialized, or ambiguously scoped variables or structures.

3. **Clearly defined, logically sound control flow**  
   - All loops and recursion have clearly stated and reachable termination conditions, ensuring no infinite loops or premature exits that break correctness.  
   - Conditional branches collectively cover all necessary logical cases—no missing or contradictory conditions.  
   - No dead code or unreachable logic that interferes with intended behavior.

4. **Precise and unambiguous algorithmic logic**  
   - Every computational step, update, and state mutation is clearly described with no logical gaps or contradictions.  
   - The intended algorithm is fully and explicitly captured; no crucial steps omitted or only implied.

5. **Thorough boundary and special-case management**  
   - Explicit attention to edge conditions, including smallest/largest input sizes, overflow/underflow risks, zero-division, empty outputs, and any domain-specific corner cases.  
   - Correct handling or explicit checks to avoid domain/range errors or undefined operations.

6. **Deterministic, correct output definition**  
   - Outputs or return values, including intermediate results, are fully specified and derived strictly from prior steps.  
   - No ambiguity in what is returned or how the final result is constructed.

7. **No dependence on unstated external factors**  
   - The snippet must be entirely self-contained: no reliance on external helper routines, implicit language-specific features, or contextual knowledge not provided.  
   - No assumptions that the reader fills gaps or infers missing details.

8. **Style and syntax neutrality with respect to correctness**  
   - Variations in pseudocode style, formatting, or idiomatic expressions are permissible **only if** they do not threaten logical clarity or completeness.  
   - Minor cosmetic or structural style differences should not influence the decision.

**Decision rule:**  
- Output `1` if **and only if** all 8 pillars above are fully met with **zero ambiguity or omission**.  
- Output `0` otherwise — even if the snippet is very close but has **any** unclear, missing, or logically inconsistent part that could cause failure on any unit test.

**Output formatting:**  
- If given multiple pseudocode snippets, output a sequence of digits (each `1` or `0`), in the same order, **without spaces, newlines, or any other characters**.  
- No explanations, no comments, **only** the digit sequence.

**Additional strict instructions:**  
- Be absolutely conservative: do not guess, infer, or fill in unstated details.  
- Ambiguity or incompleteness in control flow, initialization, boundary cases, or output is a disqualifier.  
- Consider that passing *all* unit tests requires flawless handling of every scenario described or implied by the pseudocode’s problem domain.  
- Guard against common pitfalls such as infinite loops, missing edge case handling, ambiguous variable scope, implicit assumptions, or incomplete return definitions.
