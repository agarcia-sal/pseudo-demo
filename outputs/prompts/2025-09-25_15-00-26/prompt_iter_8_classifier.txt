Given the complexity and ambiguity often present in pseudocode, especially regarding subtle correctness and completeness issues, a more detailed and explicit prompt framing is necessary to improve precision in determining reproducibility (defined as passing *all* unit tests without error or ambiguity).

A key weakness in the original prompt is that it relies on a vague notion of "correctly passing all its intended unit tests" without explicating what criteria or checks the evaluator should consider, nor cues for distinguishing near-miss behavior, subtle edge cases, or incomplete specifications. Ambiguous or underspecified pseudocode can easily trick a model into overly optimistic or pessimistic assessments.

Moreover, the prompt should guide the evaluation towards a *systematic*, comprehensive, and logically rigorous inspection of the pseudocodeâ€™s *functional completeness*, *determinism*, *boundary condition handling*, *semantic clarity*, and *algorithmic correctness*, rather than relying on superficial or partial interpretation.

# Enhanced prompt (designed for best reproducibility classification accuracy):

**Prompt:**

You will be given one or more pieces of pseudocode. For each piece of pseudocode, your task is to determine **if it is fully reproducible**, which means the pseudocode is described with **sufficient clarity, correctness, and completeness** to:

- deterministically and unambiguously implement the intended algorithm,
- correctly handle all relevant input cases including edge and boundary conditions,
- and consequently pass *all* the unit tests designed to validate its correctness.

**Reproducible** here refers to whether the pseudocode can be directly translated into a correct implementation that passes every associated test case without runtime errors, logical bugs, or incorrect results.

Your answer must be exactly one numeric digit for each pseudocode input, with **1** indicating *reproducible* and **0** indicating *not reproducible*. You must not provide any explanations, reasoning, or text other than the sequence of 1s and 0s corresponding to the order of the pseudocode inputs given.

When evaluating each pseudocode, consider the following criteria thoroughly:

1. **Completeness:**  
   - Are all variables, data structures, and states properly initialized?  
   - Are all goals of the function clearly stated and achievable by the pseudocode?  
   - Are all possible input ranges and scenarios considered (including empty inputs, minimal/maximal sizes, and invalid/corner cases)?

2. **Clarity and Unambiguity:**  
   - Is the pseudocode precise about control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion), data access, and operations?  
   - Are there ambiguous operations or undefined behaviors?  
   - Are variable updates and conditions logically explicit and consistent?  
   - Are indexing operations within valid bounds?  
   - Is the order of execution clear and deterministic?

3. **Correctness and Logic:**  
   - Does the pseudocode implement the correct algorithm to solve the stated problem?  
   - Are built-in functions, operations, or methods used consistently and correctly or adequately approximated?  
   - Are arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations correctly composed?  
   - Does it handle special cases (like integer overflow, string trimming, base cases in recursion) in a stable manner?

4. **Consistency with Specifications:**  
   - Does the pseudocode align with standard problem constraints and expected behavior?  
   - Are return values and output types clearly specified and coherent with the problem domain?

5. **Error and Exception Handling (Explicit or Implicit):**  
   - If the problem domain requires it, does the pseudocode handle invalid input or exceptional states gracefully?  
   - Is the termination guaranteed (no infinite loops)?

---

**Final output instructions:**

- After reading each pseudocode input, **output immediately and only one digit: 1 or 0**.  
- The output sequence must abide strictly by the order of the pseudocode inputs given, concatenated without spaces or delimiters.  
- No explanations, no additional text, and no formatting beyond the digits.

---

**Example usage:**

```
Pseudocode 1: <pseudocode here>  
Pseudocode 2: <another pseudocode here>  
...

Output: 10
```

In the example above, the first pseudocode is reproducible (1), the second is not (0).

---

**Summary:** Carefully evaluate each pseudocode *in depth*, applying the completeness, clarity, correctness, and consistency checks listed. Your output will precisely convey reproducibility, maximizing accuracy in line with true ability to pass *all* associated unit tests.

**This enhanced prompt explicitly guides the evaluator (human or model) to analyze structural, logical, and semantic qualities beyond surface syntax, making it robust against cosmetic variations or near-misses, and improving differentiation between truly reproducible and non-reproducible cases.**
