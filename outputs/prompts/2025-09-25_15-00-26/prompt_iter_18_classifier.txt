Task:  
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets. For each snippet, output a single digit — `1` if the pseudocode is absolutely reproducible, or `0` otherwise.  
Output only the concatenated sequence of digits corresponding exactly to the order of snippets given, with no spaces, newlines, or additional characters.

Definition of *absolutely reproducible*:  
A pseudocode snippet is *absolutely reproducible* if **any faithful implementation that strictly and solely follows its explicit instructions, without any external assumptions, unstated behaviors, or inferred details, would pass every conceivable unit test designed to validate the intended functionality.** This includes normal inputs, all edge, boundary, corner, malformed, exceptional, and domain-relevant invalid cases. The pseudocode must be unambiguous, comprehensive, and fully self-contained.

Core Instructions (apply these strictly to each snippet):  
- Do **not** fill in or guess missing details, implicit constraints, or unstated initializations, even if they appear reasonable.  
- Do **not** ignore any ambiguity, partial logic, hidden control flow, or implicit state that could lead to failure or undefined behavior.  
- Err on the side of caution: if there is *any* potential gap or uncertainty affecting correctness or completeness for *any* unit test, output `0`.  
- Do **not** consider cosmetic variants, style, or idiomatic pseudocode as disqualifying unless they introduce logical ambiguity or incompleteness.  
- Assume the problem’s full input domain includes all valid and reasonably expected inputs unless explicitly restricted.

Exhaustive Reproducibility Checklist (all criteria below must be satisfied without equivocation):  

1. **Explicit and exhaustive input and domain coverage**  
   - Inputs, their types, valid value ranges, and all special/edge cases (empty, zero-length, minimal, maximal, null-like, malformed, or unusual inputs relevant to the domain) are explicitly handled or inevitably covered by the logic as defined, **with no assumptions or omissions**.   
   - No reliance on implicit guarantees from the problem statement or environment.  
   - Error cases and invalid inputs are addressed if within scope, or safely left unreachable or invalid by explicit input constraints.

2. **Complete, unambiguous state initialization and declarations**  
   - All variables, data structures, accumulators, flags, indices, counters, and helper states are clearly declared and explicitly initialized before any use.  
   - No use of undefined, implicitly typed, or ambiguously scoped objects or states.   
   - Modifications to state are precise and fully accounted for.

3. **Deterministic, logically coherent, and fully covered control flow**  
   - All control structures (loops, recursion, branches, switches) cover **every possible path and condition** completely and explicitly.  
   - Loop and recursion conditions guarantee termination without premature exits, infinite loops, or skipped necessary cases.  
   - No path is left undefined, ambiguous, or logically contradictory.  
   - Dead or unreachable code must not interfere with correctness or intent.

4. **Algorithmic logic detailed and gapless**  
   - Each computational and state update step is explicitly delineated with no missing or vaguely implied operations.  
   - Arithmetic, indexing, data transformations, and logical decisions are clearly correct and consistent at every step.  
   - The end-to-end intended algorithm or procedure is fully and explicitly expressed, including any preprocessing, iteration, or postprocessing steps essential to correctness.

5. **Robust boundary conditions and exceptional case handling**  
   - Edge cases for input size, value extremes, empty or singleton inputs, zero divisors, overflows/underflows, or domain-specific boundary conditions are explicitly handled or inevitably resolved without assumption.  
   - Potential runtime errors, out-of-bounds accesses, or undefined operations are prevented or guarded against by explicit checks or logic.  
   - Error or invalid input scenarios—if part of the problem’s input domain—are clearly managed or safely excluded.

6. **Precise, deterministic output specification**  
   - Output values or return results are fully defined in type, structure, and format, deterministically derived from inputs and states.  
   - No ambiguity about what is returned or output, including intermediate and final states.  
   - Output semantics fully conform with the implied or stated problem requirements.

7. **Absolute self-containment and no implicit dependencies**  
   - The snippet must be fully interpretable and directly implementable without requiring any external context, implicit functions, language-specific behavior, environment features, third-party libraries, or unstated conventions.  
   - No logic or correctness depends on assumptions outside the snippet text.

8. **Clarity-preserving style and pseudocode conventions**  
   - Variations in style, naming, or idiomatic constructs are acceptable only if they unequivocally maintain full logical clarity and completeness.  
   - Ambiguities introduced by terse, inconsistent, or unclear expression that impede faithful implementation or verification disqualify reproducibility.

Decision logic:  
- Output `1` if and only if **all** eight criteria are fulfilled completely, unambiguously, and with no exceptions or gaps.  
- Otherwise, output `0`, including for near-perfect or near-complete snippets that admit any risk of failure or missing coverage under some unit test.

Output format:  
- For multiple snippets, output a single concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s in the exact order snippets were received, without spaces or line breaks.  
- Output nothing else.

Strict evaluation notes:  
- Do **not** interpret implied intent beyond the text provided.  
- Perform comprehensive logical reasoning about input domain, control flows, state changes, and output formulation.  
- Consider all conceivable unit tests: edge cases, extreme and invalid inputs, error states, and unusual boundary conditions consistent with the snippet’s problem domain.  
- Guard against subtle flaws: infinite or premature loop exits, uninitialized use, partial input coverage, ambiguous returns, hidden state dependencies, tacit environment assumptions, unclear output format, or incomplete logic.
