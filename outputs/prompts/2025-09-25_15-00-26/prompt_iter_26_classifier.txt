Task:  
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets. Each snippet purports to fully describe a solution’s algorithmic logic for an unspecified computational problem. Your task is to determine, for each snippet, whether it is *fully reproducible* according to the strict criteria below.  

For every pseudocode snippet, output exactly one digit without spaces, newlines, or any extra characters:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is *fully reproducible*, meaning **any faithful implementation adhering strictly and only to the pseudocode, without supplementing, omitting, or inferring any detail, will pass every possible unit test validating full correctness across all normal, edge, boundary, error, invalid, and corner cases within the problem’s scope**.  
- `0` otherwise.  

Concatenate all digits in the order of the input snippets. No other output is allowed.  

Definition of *fully reproducible*:  
A pseudocode snippet is *fully reproducible* if and only if **every aspect** of the algorithm and input/output behavior is specified exhaustively, unambiguously, and with no assumptions beyond what is explicitly written, so that any developer could produce a correct, passing implementation straight from the snippet alone.  

Evaluate each snippet against *all* of the following rigorous criteria:  

1. **Explicit and comprehensive input specification**  
   - Inputs, their types, domains, constraints, and formats are *fully defined* without any implicit assumptions.  
   - All valid inputs including boundary values (empty, minimal, maximal, zero-length, null-equivalents) are addressed.  
   - All invalid or out-of-spec inputs within the problem’s scope must be handled explicitly (via rejection, exception, error return, or defined fallback behavior), or explicitly excluded from possible inputs.  
   - No reliance on external validation or “trusted” input assumptions.  

2. **Complete and clear state definition**  
   - All variables, data structures, and states—primitive or complex—are fully declared, initialized, and typed before use.  
   - Sizes, contents, and initial values of data structures are specified explicitly where relevant.  
   - No use of undefined or implicitly defaulted variables, fields, or indices.  
   - No reliance on hidden or external state.  

3. **Deterministic, exhaustive, and sound control flow**  
   - All control paths (loops, conditionals, recursion, switches) are fully specified: entry conditions, progress steps, exit conditions, and termination proofs exist and are unambiguous.  
   - Branches cover *all* relevant cases and states without gaps or ambiguity.  
   - No contradictory, unreachable, or logically inconsistent branches that could alter correctness.  
   - No potential for infinite loops or premature termination violating correctness.  

4. **Exact and unambiguous algorithmic operations**  
   - Every step—assignment, computation, state mutation, comparison, arithmetic, indexing—is spelled out explicitly and correctly.  
   - No vague, missing, or guesswork-required operations or intermediate steps.  
   - Indexing and boundary checks are clearly defined and respected to prevent out-of-range access.  

5. **Robust handling of all boundaries, edge, and special cases**  
   - Edge cases such as minimum/maximum input sizes, empty data, zero divisors, overflow/underflow risks, null values, and all special cases are addressed explicitly.  
   - Failure modes, error conditions, exceptional inputs are anticipated and handled or safely excluded explicitly within the pseudocode.  
   - Returns, exceptions, or error flags are consistently and clearly defined along all paths.  

6. **Fully specified, deterministic, and correct output definitions**  
   - Output format, values, types, and derivation from inputs/internal states are exact and unambiguous.  
   - Intermediate outputs, if any, are also clearly specified.  
   - Output matches problem conventions precisely and completely, leaving no room for interpretation or variation.  

7. **No unimplemented dependencies, assumptions, or external context**  
   - The snippet is *self-contained*, relying solely on primitives and constructs defined explicitly or universally recognized in pseudocode (e.g., integer arithmetic, basic control structures).  
   - No dependencies on external libraries, runtime environments, language-specific behaviors, hidden state, or undocumented helpers.  
   - No assumptions about implicit defaults, global variables, or external validation/support.  

8. **Clarity, consistency, and precision in style and semantics**  
   - Pseudocode uses consistent notation, meaningful variable names, and unambiguous syntax and idioms.  
   - Ambiguity caused by terse expression, style inconsistency, conflicting interpretations, or shorthand that obscures logic is disallowed.  
   - Carefully mechanics that maintain exact semantic correspondence to an implementable algorithm without guesswork.  

**Strict evaluation guidance:**  
- If *any* detail is missing, ambiguous, incomplete, contradictory, or could plausibly lead to failure on *some* valid unit test (including edge, corner, or error cases), output `0` for that snippet.  
- Output `1` *only* if the snippet satisfies *all* eight criteria fully and rigorously, guaranteeing correct behavior across *all* conceivable tests within the problem domain.  
- Do *not* supply or infer any missing constraints, operations, data domains, or assumptions.  
- Do *not* overlook subtleties such as implicit indexing assumptions, uninitialized variables, implicit short-circuiting, or unclear output formatting.  
- Thoroughly imagine corner cases, unusual inputs, and non-obvious execution paths, and demand explicit handling or exclusion for all.  
- Guard against common reproducibility pitfalls: partial/incomplete logic, unsound termination, ambiguous state, implicit knowledge, or unstated conventions.
