Task:  
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each describing a solution to an unspecified computational problem. For each snippet, output exactly one digit:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is *fully reproducible*, meaning that **any faithful, literal implementation of this pseudocode will pass every conceivable unit test related to its intended functionality without requiring any unstated assumptions**.  
- `0` otherwise.  

Output only a sequence of digits (one per snippet), concatenated in the same order as the inputs, with no spaces, newlines, or any other characters. No explanations or extra text.

Definition of *fully reproducible* pseudocode:  

A pseudocode snippet is *fully reproducible* if it unambiguously and comprehensively specifies all details necessary for a correct and complete implementation that passes every valid unit test relevant to its problem domain, including:  
- All normal and edge cases  
- Boundary and corner cases  
- Error conditions and invalid inputs (if within problem scope)  
- Exceptional, atypical, and degenerative inputs  
- Any other plausible inputs or states logically implied by the snippet  

This implies zero reliance on guesswork, implicit constraints, external context, or filling in any missing information.

---

Instructions and evaluation criteria:  

When analyzing each pseudocode snippet, rigorously verify that ALL of the following 9 criteria are satisfied **without any ambiguity, uncertainty, or incompleteness**. If **any** single criterion is violated, output `0` for that snippet.

1. **Clear input specification and exhaustive input handling**  
   - The snippet explicitly or logically guarantees correct handling of all valid input types and ranges defined or reasonably inferable from context.  
   - Includes explicit consideration of empty inputs, zero values, maximum/minimum sizes, special characters, null-equivalents, malformed or invalid inputs (if applicable).  
   - No assumptions that inputs will be well-formed or pre-validated unless explicitly declared.

2. **Complete and unambiguous state and data initialization**  
   - Every variable, data structure, accumulator, flag, counter, index, and helper state used is clearly declared, initialized, and properly scoped before first use.  
   - No undefined or partially defined states, no reliance on default or implicit initial values.

3. **Deterministic and foolproof control flow and termination**  
   - All loops, recursion, and conditional branches have clearly defined, reachable, and logically sound conditions ensuring correct execution order and termination with no infinite loops or premature exits that could break correctness.  
   - All conditional scenarios are covered, mutually exclusive where necessary, with no missing or unreachable branches that affect logic or correctness.  
   - Control structures must explicitly handle all input and intermediate data-driven cases relevant for correctness.

4. **Explicit, correct, and complete core algorithmic logic**  
   - Each computational step, state mutation, arithmetic operation, indexing, and transformation is fully specified without vague or ambiguous statements.  
   - The logical algorithm flow and necessary processing steps are completely detailed, with no omissions of critical operations or dependencies.  
   - No contradictions, partial formulas, or symbolic placeholders that require interpretation beyond literal reading.

5. **Robust boundary, error, and special case management**  
   - The pseudocode explicitly addresses boundary conditions, such as empty arrays, zero length strings, zero divisions, potential arithmetic overflow or underflow, out-of-bound indices, and any domain-specific edge situations.  
   - Proper verification or guard conditions are present to prevent undefined or runtime errors.  
   - Adequate handling of error states, exceptions, invalid inputs, or atypical cases expected given problem context.

6. **Well-defined, finalized, and deterministic output formulation**  
   - The output values, return data, or resultant states are precisely defined and directly attributable to the input and computed intermediate states.  
   - No ambiguity about output type, format, or content.  
   - Output results conform clearly to intended problem requirements or expected output patterns implied by the snippet.

7. **Self-containment and zero reliance on unstated external context**  
   - The pseudocode must be directly implementable “as is” without requiring additional assumptions about environment, language features, libraries, external functions, or execution context.  
   - Any helper procedures or subfunctions used must be defined within the snippet or clearly indicated as built-in and standard.  
   - No gaps where the implementer is forced to fill in missing logic or guess unspecified details.

8. **Clarity and unambiguity in notation, style, and phrasing**  
   - Pseudocode syntax, idioms, loop constructs, naming conventions, and expressions do not introduce confusion or alternative interpretations that could affect correctness.  
   - Concise or idiomatic constructs are acceptable only if their semantics are crystal-clear and logically complete.  
   - Overly terse, inconsistent, or ambiguous styling that hinders precise comprehension disqualifies reproducibility.

9. **Explicit handling of all conceivable unit tests implied by problem scope**  
   - Your evaluation must consider *all* possible test cases—including trivial, edge, worst-case, and malformed inputs consistent with the problem domain—and verify the pseudocode would behave correctly under each without failing or requiring assumptions.  
   - Even if a single plausible input could cause failure due to missing detail or ambiguity, output `0`.  
   - Prioritize safe, conservative judgment over optimistic assumption or interpretation.

---

Decision Protocol:  
- If and only if **all nine criteria above hold completely and unequivocally**, output `1` for that snippet.  
- Otherwise, output `0`.  
- For multiple snippets, output their results concatenated in literal input order, without any delimiters or whitespace.

---

Additional notes for your internal use (do not output):  
- Do not guess missing information, even if it seems reasonable or typical.  
- Verify logical soundness and completeness of control flow and key computation steps in detail.  
- Treat implicit assumptions, incomplete initialization, missing edge checks, or partial output definitions as fatal flaws.  
- Ignore cosmetic or stylistic differences unless they cause unclear meaning or logic ambiguity.

Format to expect and respond with:  
Input:  
```<PSEUDOCODE_SNIPPET_1>```
```<PSEUDOCODE_SNIPPET_2>```
...  

Output:  
A string of digits, e.g. `1010` if you received 4 snippets, meaning snippets 1 and 3 are reproducible and 2 and 4 are not.  

**No other output, text, or whitespace allowed.**
