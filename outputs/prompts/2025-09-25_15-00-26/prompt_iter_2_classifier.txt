Given the complexities observed in the evaluation and common failure modes—such as confusing near-complete but slightly flawed pseudocode, misclassifying cosmetic variants, and missing subtle logical or syntactical ambiguities—a deeper, more nuanced prompt is warranted.

Below is a comprehensive, multi-step, precision-focused prompt designed to rigorously analyze the pseudocode’s reproducibility in a general way. It incorporates:

- Explicit clarity checks (no ambiguity, full specification of control flow and data operations).
- Correctness validation against the *definition* of reproducibility as passing *all* unit tests.
- Robust consideration of edge cases and near-miss scenarios.
- Distinguishing cosmetic variants that do not affect reproducibility from true failures.
- Using an internal logical consistency and completeness analysis, not just surface form.
- An emphasis on *precise binary* output matching the order of inputs, no extra text or commentary.

### Enhanced Prompt:

```
You are given one or more pieces of pseudocode to analyze, each intended to solve a programming problem with associated unit testing.

Your task is to evaluate **each pseudocode independently** and determine whether it is **fully reproducible**, defined as meeting all of the following criteria:

1. **Unambiguous**: The pseudocode explicitly and completely specifies all variables, data structures, control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion), and return values without contradictions or missing steps that would prevent an implementation from passing all unit tests.
2. **Semantically sound**: The logic correctly handles all standard and edge cases implied by the problem context, including proper initialization, boundary conditions, termination, and error handling where applicable.
3. **Complete**: The pseudocode is sufficiently detailed that an experienced developer could implement it directly to obtain a solution that **would pass all provided unit tests without modification or guesswork**.
4. **Consistent**: The pseudocode maintains consistency in variable naming, data usage, and control flow constructs to avoid ambiguity or undefined behavior.
5. **No latent subtle bugs or minor oversights**: Even near-miss pseudocode that fail some unit tests (>80% passing) should be marked as **not reproducible** (output 0).
6. **Cosmetic and stylistic differences** that do not affect the above criteria should not cause the pseudocode to be marked non-reproducible.

Your output must be a sequence of digits, one per pseudocode input, in the exact order received:

- Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (passes all unit tests).
- Output **0** if it is not reproducible.

**Output nothing else. No explanations, comments, or formatting.**

For each piece of pseudocode provided:

1. Analyze variable and data structure declarations and initializations: ensure they are sufficient and correctly formulated.
2. Examine loops, recursion, and conditionals: confirm they cover all valid input cases and terminate properly.
3. Check that return statements align with the expected output format and are reachable.
4. Verify explicit handling of special cases and boundary conditions (empty inputs, maximum/minimum values, zeroes, etc.).
5. Identify any ambiguous wording, missing operations, or inconsistent logic that would introduce uncertainty when implementing.
6. Confirm that the pseudocode accurately models the intended solution and algorithmic approach.
7. Evaluate modifications or cosmetic variations to ensure they do not unintentionally degrade reproducibility.
8. Discard pseudocode that passes some but not all unit tests (i.e., near misses).
9. Validate that the pseudocode allows implementation with no added assumptions or external fixes.

**Example (summary of process):**

Input pseudocode:  
`FUNCTION add(a, b) RETURN a + b END FUNCTION`  
- Clearly defined, simple, no ambiguity -> output 1

Input pseudocode:  
`FUNCTION myFunc(x) IF x > 0 THEN RETURN 1 END FUNCTION`  
- Missing branch for x ≤ 0, potentially ambiguous -> output 0

---

**Remember:**

- Your output must be concise, exact, and limited to a sequence of 0s and 1s corresponding to the input order.
- Use nothing but digits in the output, no whitespace or punctuation.
- Assume the unit tests are comprehensive; only pseudocode that would pass *all* unit tests should yield a 1.

### Why this is superior:

- It bridges semantic, syntactic, and structural verification to cover all failure modes observed.
- It explicitly includes near-miss handling as a strict failure mode.
- It captures the nuance that cosmetic changes should not impact reproducibility but logical or structural issues must.
- It reminds the evaluator to consider completeness and unambiguity, problems previously missed.
- It mandates strict binary output with no noise, avoiding downstream parsing issues.
- It handles multiple pseudocode inputs robustly in order.
- The instructions are exhaustive yet generalizable, suitable for arbitrary pseudocode inputs.

This prompt will guide any reasoning or language model to deeply verify the logical, structural, and semantic correctness of pseudocode under the definition of reproducibility, thereby significantly improving precision across all categories.
