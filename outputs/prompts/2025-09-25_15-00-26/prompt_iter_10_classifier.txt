Given the pseudocode below (one or more snippets provided sequentially), your task is to analyze each independently and determine **with complete and unambiguous certainty** whether it is *fully reproducible*.  

**Definition of Fully Reproducible:**  
If the pseudocode were translated precisely and implemented exactly as described, it would correctly and consistently pass **all** of its intended unit tests without causing any error, failure, or semantic ambiguity. In other words, it would behave exactly as expected under all input scenarios, including edge and corner cases.

---

### Evaluation Criteria

For each pseudocode snippet, you must verify that all of the following hold true **explicitly and clearly** within the pseudocode instructions:

1. **Correctness of Algorithm:**  
   - The logic and operations implement the intended core algorithm correctly and completely.  
   - No logical contradictions, missing steps, or flawed conditions.

2. **Completeness:**  
   - All necessary variables, data structures, and states are fully initialized before use.  
   - All relevant cases (including edge cases such as empty inputs, minimal/maximal values, zero or negative numbers, and special characters) are explicitly handled or covered by the flow.

3. **Explicitness & Precision:**  
   - The pseudocode contains explicit, unambiguous instructions on flow controls: loops, conditionals, recursion, and termination conditions.  
   - No ambiguous language, no implicit assumptions about variable values, environment, or behavior.  
   - All increments, decrements, index bounds, and string/array slicing are clearly specified.  
   - The pseudocode is free from infinite loops, unreachable code, or early exits not accounted for in the logic.

4. **Consistency with Intended Return/Output:**  
   - The return values or outputs are clearly defined, consistent, and correspond to the final intended result.  
   - Side effects, mutations, or state changes do not contradict or invalidate the final output.

5. **Boundary and Error Handling:**  
   - Conditionals or guards are in place to handle boundary conditions, overflow/underflow (if applicable), and invalid or unexpected inputs.  
   - The pseudocode does not rely on external assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated.

6. **Determinism & Reproducibility:**  
   - Given the same input, the pseudocode’s behavior is deterministic and reproducible.  
   - No randomness, no dependence on external state, no underspecified behavior.

### Output Instructions

- For **each** pseudocode snippet provided (in the order given), output a **single digit**:  
  - `1` if the pseudocode snippet meets **all** the above criteria and is guaranteed to pass **all** unit tests without error.  
  - `0` if it fails to meet **any** one or more criteria — i.e., if there is any ambiguity, incompleteness, error, missing case, or inconsistency that would cause the implementation to fail some test(s) or be unclear.

- The output must be a **continuous string of digits** (`1`s and `0`s) corresponding exactly in order to the input pseudocode snippets.  
- No extra text, explanation, punctuation, whitespace, or formatting.  
- Do **not** guess based on partial correctness or probable intent — your judgment must be absolute and verifiable solely from the provided pseudocode.

### Additional Guidance

- **Ignore superficial stylistic or cosmetic differences** such as variable names, formatting, or structural variations that do not affect logical correctness or completeness.  
- **Consider subtle logical flaws, missing edge case handling, or incomplete initialization as failures.** For example:  
  - Loop bounds that miss the last element.  
  - Missing return statements on some branches.  
  - Imprecise or incomplete handling of zero-length inputs.  
  - Unclear or unspecified index calculations.  
- **Recursive or iterative flows must have clearly specified base/termination cases.**  
- Pay special attention to potential integer overflow, empty inputs, zero values, string indexing, and mutations of shared state.  
- Consistency in variable usage and data structure manipulation is critical — any mismatch or ambiguity renders the pseudocode non-reproducible.

### Format for input pseudocode snippet(s):

```
<PSEUDOCODE SNIPPET 1>

<PSEUDOCODE SNIPPET 2>

...

<PSEUDOCODE SNIPPET N>
```

---

### Your final response after analyzing the input pseudocode snippets must be:

```
<sequence_of_1_and_0_digits>
```

where each digit corresponds to snippet 1 through N respectively.
