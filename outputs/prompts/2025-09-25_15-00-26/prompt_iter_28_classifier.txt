Task Description:  
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each representing a complete solution to an unspecified computational problem. Your sole task is to **output a sequence of digits (one digit per snippet, concatenated in input order) where each digit is either:**  
  
- `1` if the pseudocode snippet is **fully reproducible**, meaning any faithful and literal implementation of the snippet, without adding, omitting, or inferring details, would pass *all* conceivable unit tests verifying complete correctness (including normal, edge, boundary, invalid, error, and corner cases) within the problemâ€™s scope;  
- `0` otherwise.  
  
**You must output nothing but the exact sequence of digits in the input order, without spaces, newlines, or any extra characters or explanation.**

**Precise Definition of Full Reproducibility:**  
A pseudocode snippet is *fully reproducible* **if and only if** it satisfies *all* the criteria below with absolute clarity, completeness, and no ambiguity or hidden assumptions:

1. **Explicit, complete, and precise input specification**  
   - Input domains, types, valid ranges, and structures are unambiguously defined or logically implied with zero assumptions left to the reader or implementer.  
   - All relevant invalid, malformed, null, empty, or boundary inputs within the problem scope are explicitly handled or safely and deterministically excluded.  
   - The snippet must never rely on external validation or implicit input correctness assumptions.

2. **Thorough and explicit variable, state, and data structure declaration and initialization**  
   - Every variable, index, flag, accumulator, and data structure is declared with clear type/structure, fully initialized before usage.  
   - No undeclared or implicitly assumed variables or data structures; no external or environment-dependent symbols or types.  
   - Sizes, initial values, default states, and memory layouts must be explicitly stated where relevant.

3. **Deterministic, exhaustive, and sound control flow coverage**  
   - All loops, recursion, and control structures have clearly defined and logically sound entry, progress, and termination conditions preventing infinite loops, dead code, partial executions, or premature exits that could result in incorrect behavior.  
   - Conditional branches and switch cases collectively and exhaustively cover all input and intermediate states, leaving zero ambiguity about flow.  
   - No contradictory, overlapping, or unreachable branches that affect correctness.

4. **Complete, unambiguous, and logically consistent algorithmic operations**  
   - Each computational operation, update, mutation, comparison, indexing, or return value is fully specified without gaps, vague terms, or "assumed" steps.  
   - Arithmetic and indexing respects boundaries and data type limits explicitly; no out-of-bounds or undefined behavior possible.  
   - Sequencing of operations matches the intended algorithmic logic precisely.

5. **Robust and explicit boundary, edge case, error, and exceptional condition handling**  
   - Minimal, maximal, empty, zero, invalid, overflow, underflow, or error-prone conditions are clearly and explicitly handled or accounted for.  
   - Error handling or graceful degradation paths are specified if the problem scope expects them.  
   - No undefined or unsafe states at any execution step.

6. **Deterministic, fully defined output specification**  
   - Outputs (return values, data, status, formats) are unequivocally specified, derived strictly from prior computation with no interpretation ambiguity.  
   - Output types, formats, and contents adhere fully to expected problem conventions without gaps or underspecifications.

7. **Complete self-containment and zero reliance on external or implicit assumptions**  
   - Implementation requires no external context, libraries, system or language behaviors, hidden states, or environment dependencies.  
   - All needed primitives, definitions, and logic are present in the snippet itself or universally understood in pseudocode conventions.  
   - No details left for implementer inference, intuition, or guesswork.

8. **Clarity, consistent notation, and unambiguous syntax ensuring unique interpretation**  
   - Pseudocode style, keywords, and idioms, while flexible, must be uniform, clear, and free from conflicting interpretations or ambiguities.  
   - No terse, cryptic, or inconsistent expressions that can cause divergent implementations or doubts about logic.

**Evaluation Instructions:**  
- Perform a *rigorous and conservative* analysis of each pseudocode snippet against *all 8 criteria* above.  
- **If there is any ambiguity, incompleteness, missing detail, logical contradiction, or unstated assumption that could plausibly cause any unit test failure under any reasonable interpretation, output `0` for that snippet.**  
- **Output `1` only if the snippet meets every criterion without exception, guaranteeing a faithful implementation would pass every possible correctness test under the problem domain.**  
- This decision is holistic and must consider correctness over the full input domain and corner cases, not just typical scenarios.

---

**Strict Prohibitions:**  
- Do *not* supply or infer any missing details from intuition or external knowledge beyond the snippet.  
- Do *not* accept implicit assumptions about input validity, environment behavior, language features, or data structures undefined inside the snippet.  
- Do *not* tolerate partial or heuristic correctness; partial test passing is insufficient.  
- Watch for subtle flaws such as uninitialized variables, incomplete loop bounds, ambiguous control flow, missing boundary checks, or inconsistently described outputs.

---

**Your Response Format:**  
- For input pseudocode snippets in the order given, output a single line consisting of only digits `0` and `1`, one digit per snippet, concatenated in input order.  
- Do not output any other text, whitespace, explanations, or formatting.
