Given the pseudocode below, carefully evaluate whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”that is, it must include all necessary and unambiguous logic, steps, and details required to deterministically pass every relevant unit test for its intended functionality. Consider whether any critical information is missing, ambiguous, or incomplete in the pseudocode that could prevent correct implementation or testing.

**Output only a single digit:**
- **1** if the pseudocode is complete and leaves no doubt it can pass all unit tests as-is.
- **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, or missing details that would cause failure in any unit test.

**The output must be exactly one character ("1" or "0") with no extra text, formatting, or explanation.**  
Multiple pseudocode inputs will be evaluated in sequence, and your outputs should correspond, line-by-line, to each input's reproducibility assessment.
