Analyze the given pseudocode carefully to determine if it is fully detailed, logically consistent, and free from ambiguity or omissions that would prevent a correct implementation from passing every unit test. Specifically, verify that all necessary steps, input/output specifications, control flows, and edge cases are clearly and unambiguously described without contradictions or gaps. Based on this analysis, output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible—that is, sufficiently and precisely specified to guarantee a correct implementation passing all tests—or **0** if it is incomplete, unclear, contradictory, or insufficient for guaranteed success. Only output the single digit **1** or **0**, without any additional text, explanation, or symbols. The outputs must correspond exactly in order to the sequence of pseudocode inputs given.
