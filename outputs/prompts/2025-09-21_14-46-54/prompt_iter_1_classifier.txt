Given the input pseudocode, analyze whether it is complete, unambiguous, and logically coherent such that it can be implemented to pass all unit tests. Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (i.e., sufficient and clear enough to be correctly implemented and pass all tests), or **0** if it lacks necessary detail, contains contradictions, or is incomplete making it impossible to pass all tests. Output only the digit **1** or **0**, nothing else.
