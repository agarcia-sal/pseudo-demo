Given the following pseudocode, rewrite it to produce a version that preserves all its original functionality while being as different as possible in structure, style, and expression. Keep all function names exactly the same as in the original code. Keep all class names and their hierarchy unchanged, including the same organization of classes and objects. Your output should consist solely of the rewritten pseudocode without any additional explanations or commentary.
