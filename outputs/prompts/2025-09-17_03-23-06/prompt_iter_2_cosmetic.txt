Given the provided pseudocode, produce a fully rewritten version that retains all original functionality and logic but is transformed to be as syntactically and stylistically distinct as possible. You must:  
- Keep every function name exactly the same.  
- Retain all class names, their hierarchies, and the organization of classes and objects exactly as in the input.  
- Change all other aspects freely, including variable names, control flow constructs, formatting, commenting style, ordering within functions (where semantically safe), and code structureâ€”aim for maximum divergence from the input pseudocode without altering behavior.  
Output only the rewritten pseudocode without any explanations, comments, or additional text.
