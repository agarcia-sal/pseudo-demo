Given a problem description, write concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode that captures the solution using compact, high-level natural language. Use symbolic assignments and abbreviations where appropriate. Format the pseudocode as numbered lines starting from 1, avoiding any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations. Prefer one-liners and simple control structures. Follow this style:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce only the pseudocode, nothing else. Your output should be optimized for clarity and brevity within a 5-second generation limit.
