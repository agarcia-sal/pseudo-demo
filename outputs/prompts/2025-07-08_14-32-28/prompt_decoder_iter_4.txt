Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code. Your code must:

- Be enclosed entirely within a single triple backtick Python code block:
```python
# your code here
```
- Use plain `input()` calls without prompt strings for all input operations.
- Include all necessary imports and use any standard Python packages as needed to maximize correctness and performance.
- Be optimized for clarity, correctness, and execution speed, ensuring it finishes within 5 seconds.
- Avoid any extraneous comments, explanations, or text outside the code block.
- Handle inputs from standard input and output results via standard output exactly as implied by the pseudocode logic.

Do not add or assume any input prompts, separators, or user interaction beyond what the pseudocode specifies.
