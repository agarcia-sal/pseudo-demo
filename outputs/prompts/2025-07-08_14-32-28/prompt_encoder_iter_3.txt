Given a problem description, write concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode that captures the solution using compact, natural, and high-level language. Use symbolic assignments and common abbreviations where suitable. Express control flow with simple, one-line structures (e.g., `while condition: action`, `if condition: action`). Omit all purpose statements, summaries, explanations, comments, and notes. Provide only the pseudocode as numbered lines starting from 1, using no separator lines or extraneous formatting. Follow this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode uses natural but succinct language to maintain readability and brevity, enabling fast generation (within 5 seconds) and easy understanding. For example:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
8.   set min_i ← i  
9.   for j ← i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
10.    set min_i ← j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
11.   swap A[i], A[min_i]  
12. print all elements of A
