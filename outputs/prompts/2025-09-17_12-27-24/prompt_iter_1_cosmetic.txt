Given the input pseudocode, rewrite the pseudocode to produce a version that is as different as possible in structure, style, and expression while preserving all original functionality exactly. Maintain the same function names, class names, and class/object hierarchies as in the original pseudocode. Your output should contain only the rewritten pseudocode without any explanations or additional text.
