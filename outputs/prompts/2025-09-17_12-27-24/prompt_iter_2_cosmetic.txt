Given the input pseudocode, generate a completely restructured and rephrased version that preserves every original functionality and logic exactly, while maximizing differences in syntax, control flow, variable usage, and overall organization. You must retain all original function names, class names, and maintain the exact same class and object hierarchies and relationships without alteration. Your rewrite should use alternative constructs, different loop and conditional styles, varied indentation and spacing patterns, distinct naming of temporary variables (except function and class names), and any other syntactic or stylistic changes to make the pseudocode substantially distinct in appearance and flow from the original. Output only the rewritten pseudocodeâ€”no explanations, comments, or extra text.
