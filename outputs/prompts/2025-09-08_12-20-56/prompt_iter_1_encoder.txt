Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Make it easy to read and understandable by using natural language mixed with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Use mostly one-liners and compact constructs. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should reflect the logic clearly and succinctly within a 5-second generation time.
