Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations. Present steps as numbered lines, preferring one-liners and high-level instructions. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, comments, or explanatory notes—only pseudocode. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode is compact and understandable. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best output within this limit.
