Given the pseudocode below, carefully evaluate whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”meaning it is complete, logically consistent, unambiguous, and sufficient to pass **all** unit tests for its intended behavior.  
For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit per case: **1** if reproducible, or **0** if not. Produce no additional text, explanations, or formatting. The outputs must appear in the exact order of the inputs provided.  
Pseudocode:  
```  
{input}
