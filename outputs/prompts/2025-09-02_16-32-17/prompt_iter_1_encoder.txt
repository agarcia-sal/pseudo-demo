Given a problem description, write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that captures the core algorithm in a compact, high-level style using natural language, one-liners, symbolic assignments, and abbreviations. Do not include purpose, summary, overview, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Use a numbered line format as in:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode is understandable and follows this style, prioritizing clarity and brevity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible output within that limit.
