Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be written in a compact, high-level style using natural language, one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format exactly, numbering each line:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and brevity, making the logic straightforward and understandable. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best output possible within this limit.
