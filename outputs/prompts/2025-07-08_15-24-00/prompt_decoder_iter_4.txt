Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic Python code that correctly implements the described logic. Your code must:

- Use standard input/output via `input()` and `print()` without custom prompts or messages.
- Produce exactly the expected output format with no extra text or separators.
- Handle inputs robustly and efficiently to run within 5 seconds on typical constraints.
- Be contained entirely within one Python code block formatted as:

```python
# Your full Python solution here
```

You may use any standard Python libraries to optimize clarity, correctness, and performance.  
Do not include explanations or comments outside the code block. Only output the Python code.
