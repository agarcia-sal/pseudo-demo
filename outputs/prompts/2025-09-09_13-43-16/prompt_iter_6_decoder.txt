Translate the following pseudocode into fully functional, idiomatic, and efficient Python code.  
- Use the exact function names and signatures as specified in the pseudocode.  
- Implement all necessary helper classes or imports that the pseudocode implies or requires, so that the code runs independently.  
- Optimize for clarity, correctness, and performance within a 5-second execution limit.  
- Enclose only the complete Python code inside a single fenced code block using triple backticks and specify the language as python, for example:  
```python  
# your fully implemented code here  
```  
- Do not include any text, explanation, comments, or anything outside the code block.  
- You may use any standard Python library or package if it improves readability or efficiency.
