Create concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description, preserving original function and variable names exactly. Use natural language combined with symbolic operators and common abbreviations to ensure readability and brevity. Prefer one-liners and inline simple control structures, minimizing line count without losing clarity. Begin with:

in function <function_name>

Declare variables naturally, e.g.:

let n be integer

Follow this exact numbered format, without additional separator lines or comments:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid explanations, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode. Use idiomatic, compact constructs (for loops, conditionals, assignments) and keep everything high-level. The style should be natural but succinct, easily understood, and optimized for rapid generation within 5 seconds.
