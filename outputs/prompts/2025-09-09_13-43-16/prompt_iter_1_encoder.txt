Create pseudocode from the given problem description without including any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not add notes or explanations. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language but kept compact and high-level. Use concise one-liners, symbolic operators, and abbreviations where appropriate. Prefer a format like:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Focus on clarity and brevity. Avoid comments. Follow this style strictly. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible output within this time.
