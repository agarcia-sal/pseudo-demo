Create pseudocode from the given problem description adhering strictly to the original function name.  
Produce concise, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode using natural language with symbolic operators and standard abbreviations.  
Use mostly one-line statements and avoid detailed implementation specifics or low-level code.  
Do NOT include any purpose, summary, explanation, notes, comments, or overview statements—output only the raw pseudocode.  
Follow this numbering and formatting style exactly (no separator lines):  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use clear control structures and assignment statements. Prefer brevity without sacrificing clarity.  
Respect typical pseudocode conventions but keep it compact and natural.  
Output should be formatted as numbered lines with clear indentation for nested blocks, maintaining logical structure but minimizing verbosity.  
Always keep the original function name as given, and do not redefine or rename functions or variables unnecessarily.  
Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best concise and clear pseudocode within this limit.
