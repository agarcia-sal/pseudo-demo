Translate the given pseudocode into complete, executable, and idiomatic Python code that strictly preserves the function names and signatures from the pseudocode.  
- Implement all implied or required helper classes, functions, and necessary imports to ensure the code is self-contained and runs correctly without modifications.  
- Prioritize correctness, readability, and performance; your solution must execute efficiently within a 5-second time limit.  
- You may use any built-in or standard Python library/module to enhance clarity or performance.  
- Provide the entire solution enclosed in a single Python fenced code block, exactly as shown below:  
```python  
# your full implemented Python code here  
```  
- Include no additional text, explanations, comments, or output outside the code block.  
- Avoid partial implementations; submit the complete code that directly corresponds to the pseudocode.
