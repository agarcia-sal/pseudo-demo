Write pseudocode for the given problem description. Do not include a purpose, summary, or overview—only the pseudocode itself. Use clear, easy-to-read, high-level, and compact instructions with natural language, favoring concise one-liners, symbolic notation, and abbreviations. Avoid comments or explanations. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Your pseudocode should be efficient and straightforward, suitable for understanding the solution quickly. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible concise pseudocode within this limit.
