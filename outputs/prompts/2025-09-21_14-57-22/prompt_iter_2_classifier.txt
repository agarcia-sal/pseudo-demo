Analyze the provided pseudocode thoroughly to determine if it is precisely, unambiguously, and completely defined such that it can deterministically pass all unit tests that verify full correctness of the intended algorithm. Consider logical flow, coverage of all input cases, necessary variable initializations, termination conditions, absence of contradictions, and sufficient detail that leaves no room for interpretation or missing steps.  
Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is fully reproducible by these criteria (completely specified, logically sound, and sufficient for full correctness). Output **0** otherwise (includes any ambiguity, incompleteness, logical errors, or missing essential details).  
Your output must be exactly one character: either 1 or 0, with no additional text, commentary, or formatting.  
If multiple pseudocodes are given as input sequentially, output a corresponding sequence of digits in the same order, each being either 1 or 0.
