Evaluate the given pseudocode and determine if it is fully specified and logically consistent to the extent that it can pass all unit tests for its intended functionality without ambiguity or missing steps.  
Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (i.e., correctly and completely describes an algorithm that can pass all unit tests), or **0** if it is not reproducible (i.e., incomplete, ambiguous, logically incorrect, or missing critical details).  
Your output must be exactly one character: either 1 or 0. No explanations or additional text.
