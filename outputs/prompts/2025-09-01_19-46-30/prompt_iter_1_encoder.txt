Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable, using natural language, symbolic representations, abbreviations, and preferably one-liners. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, notes, or comments—only the pseudocode itself. Follow a numbered step format like this:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for compactness and clarity within a 5-second timeout to produce the best possible result.
