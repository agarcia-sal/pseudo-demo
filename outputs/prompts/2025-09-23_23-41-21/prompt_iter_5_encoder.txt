Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that directly implements the solution without any purpose, summary, overview, notes, or comments. Use compact, high-level expressions with natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Prefer one-liners and clear control structures. Output only the pseudocode.
