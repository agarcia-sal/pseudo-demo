```python
Translate the input pseudocode into a complete, clean, and idiomatic Python implementation that is fully executable and test-ready.  
Enclose your entire solution strictly within a single Python markdown code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.  
Your implementation must:  
- Preserve all class names, method/function names, and signatures exactly as in the pseudocode, including their full nesting and structure.  
- Convert all null-like literals (`null`, `Null`, `None`, etc.) to Python’s `None`.  
- Automatically and reliably detect any implied complex data structures such as binary trees, linked lists, graphs, or disjoint sets, by analyzing input parameters, their types, or standard coding challenge conventions, including nested list representations.  
- For each detected complex data structure:  
  • Provide robust, well-typed, and reusable helper class definitions with idiomatic constructors (e.g., `TreeNode`, `ListNode`, `UnionFind`).  
  • Provide comprehensive conversion functions that transform typical coding-challenge input forms (e.g., nested lists with `None` placeholders for missing nodes in trees) into these complex structures, with thorough sanity and type checks.  
  • Integrate input data normalization and conversion seamlessly inside the main solution methods, ensuring no input parameter representing a complex structure remains as a raw list or primitive—handle all conversions internally without requiring any caller preprocessing.  
  • Include safe 'defensive' programming constructs that handle empty, `None`, or malformed inputs gracefully without raising runtime exceptions, supporting all edge cases.  
- For algorithms involving trees, linked lists, or graphs, ensure proper traversal, modification, and data manipulation using Pythonic iterative or recursive patterns with clear and maintainable code flow.  
- Use only Python’s standard library plus built-in typing modules; no external dependencies unless absolutely essential and widely accepted in Python ecosystem, and then justify briefly by comment.  
- Adhere to modern Python best practices: use type annotations everywhere, leverage dataclasses or `__slots__` where appropriate for classes if it improves readability or performance, favor list comprehensions or generator expressions for concise constructions, and use meaningful variable names.  
- Thoroughly handle edge cases to guarantee zero runtime errors: consider empty input lists, single-node trees, `None` as root or head, invalid lists containing items of unexpected types, and other corner conditions standard for coding platforms.  
- Write clear, idiomatic code emphasizing readability, maintainability, and correctness, while also optimizing for runtime efficiency (within a 5-second execution limit). Avoid micro-optimizations that obscure logic.  
- Add comments only for complex or non-trivial logic; avoid redundant comments on straightforward code lines.  
- Import all necessary modules inside the same code block, placed clearly at the top right after the opening ```python line.  
- Do not output any explanations, text, or markdown outside the single Python code block.  
- Ensure the returned code block contains a fully working, runnable solution: no incomplete code snippets, placeholders, pseudocode, or stubs.  
- Ensure all input/output transformations and utility functions live inside the code block; do not require users to add any external helper code.

Return only this Python code block with the entire translated solution.
