```python
Translate the given pseudocode into a single, fully functional, idiomatic Python implementation enclosed strictly within one Python markdown code block (```python ... ```).  
Your translated code must:  

- Preserve every class name, function name, method signature, and their exact nesting hierarchy from the pseudocode.  
- Convert all null-like values (`null`, `Null`, `None`, etc.) in inputs, literals, or comments into Python’s `None`.  
- Detect any usage of common complex data structures (e.g., binary trees, linked lists, graphs, union-find) from input parameter types, variable names, or context clues:  
  • Provide complete, standard helper class definitions (`TreeNode`, `ListNode`, `UnionFind`, etc.) with properly typed `__init__` methods.  
  • Implement robust converter functions that transform raw inputs (e.g., lists, nested lists with `None`) into these data structures exactly as used in typical coding challenge conventions.  
  • Inline necessary type checks and conversions inside the main solution methods so all inputs automatically convert to the appropriate structure at runtime, without external preprocessing.  
- For any function parameter representing complex data structures (list of nodes, edges, etc.), never leave it as a raw list in your solution’s logic; always convert it internally and defensively. Handle edge cases like empty or malformed inputs gracefully without crashing.  
- Use only Python’s standard library and built-in types—no external dependencies unless absolutely justified and minimal.  
- Employ modern Python 3.8+ typing annotations for all function signatures, classes, variables, and return types for maximum clarity.  
- Write clear, efficient, and maintainable code prioritizing correctness and readability. Avoid overly clever or complex micro-optimizations, but do ensure the solution comfortably fits a 5-second runtime limit on typical input sizes.  
- Comment *only* on non-obvious or intricate logic to keep the code self-explanatory and clean.  
- Organize imports neatly within the code block; do not import unnecessary modules.  
- Do not output any explanatory text, notes, logs, or markdown outside the single Python code block; only output the entire translated solution enclosed within ```python ...```.  
- The code block must start with exactly three backticks and the word `python` followed immediately by a newline, and end with exactly three backticks on a new line, with no trailing spaces or lines after it.  

Return only the single, complete Python code block containing your solution, ready to run and pass rigorous tests unchanged.
