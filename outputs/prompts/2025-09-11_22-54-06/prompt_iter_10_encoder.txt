Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode from the given source code. Preserve all original class and function names, parameters, and nested structure exactly as in the source, including indentation. Use mainly natural language with standard symbols and common abbreviations, favoring compact one-line statements by combining conditions and actions wherever possible. Express control flow and data operations simply and precisely without added explanations, comments, or summaries. Number each output line sequentially starting from 1, in this exact format with no extra text or separators:

1. let n ‚Üê 0  
2. while n < limit: n++

Keep data structures and control flow faithful to the source but use generalized pseudocode constructs understandable independently, avoiding ambiguous or language-specific syntax. Do not add input/output operations unless explicitly present in the original code. The output must be self-contained, easy to read, and interpretable on its own. Complete efficiently within 5 seconds.
