Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given code with these requirements:

- Preserve all original class and function names exactly, maintaining original indentation and nesting.
- Produce pseudocode that is easy to read, clear, and compact, using mainly natural language with standard symbols and common abbreviations.
- Prefer concise one-line statements combining conditions and actions wherever possible.
- Faithfully represent control flow, data structures, and operations simply and precisely, avoiding verbosity, ambiguous syntax, or language-specific constructs.
- Do not add input/output commands unless explicitly present in the original code.
- Output only the pseudocode, numbered line by line starting at 1, in this exact format without extra text, comments, separators, or explanations:
  
  1. x ‚Üê 0  
  2. while x < n: x++

- Do not include introductory or summary statements.
- The output should be self-contained, independently understandable, and complete efficiently within 5 seconds.
