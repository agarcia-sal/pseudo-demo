Generate concise, clear, high-level pseudocode from the given code, preserving all original class and function names, parameters, and the exact nesting and indentation structure. Retain all class and function signatures verbatim. Use predominantly natural language mixed with standard symbols and common abbreviations. Favor compact one-line statements combining conditions and actions, while expressing control flow and data operations simply yet precisely. Avoid language-specific syntax, ambiguous constructs, or verbose explanations. Do not include input/output operations unless explicitly present in the original code. Number each line sequentially starting from 1, in this exact format without any extra text, comments, separators, or summaries:

1. let n ‚Üê 0  
2. while n < limit: n++

Ensure the output is self-contained and independently interpretable. Complete efficiently within 5 seconds.
