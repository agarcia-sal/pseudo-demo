Generate a concise, clear, and compact high-level pseudocode from the given code. Keep the original class names, function names, parameters, and indentation exactly as in the source. Use primarily natural language enriched with standard symbols (‚Üê, +, -, *, /, XOR, etc.) and common abbreviations. Favor one-line statements that combine conditions and actions where possible. Represent control flow (loops, conditionals) and data operations simply but precisely without verbosity or explanations. Do not include input/output commands unless they exactly appear in the original code. Number each output line sequentially in this exact format with no extra text, comments, separators, or summaries:

1. line content  
2. line content

Preserve all class and function definitions verbatim with their original indentation and nesting. Reflect data structures and control flow faithfully using generalized pseudocode constructs universally understandable without assuming language-specific syntax or types. Avoid ambiguous or overly verbose phrasing; write pseudocode that can be read and interpreted independently. Complete response within 5 seconds.
