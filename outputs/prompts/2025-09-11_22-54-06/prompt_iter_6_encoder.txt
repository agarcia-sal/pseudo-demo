Generate concise, clear pseudocode strictly reflecting the original code’s structure: retain all class names, function names, parameters, and nesting exactly as given. Use readable natural language combined with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Favor compact one-line statements wherever possible. Output only pseudocode lines numbered sequentially in this exact format with no extra text, comments, or explanations:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Prefer high-level constructs and straightforward assignments. Avoid verbosity, redundant detail, or summaries. Express control flow and data operations simply but precisely. Retain all function and class signatures verbatim. Do not include separator lines or notes. Your output must be self-contained pseudocode that can be understood in isolation. Complete efficiently within 5 seconds.
