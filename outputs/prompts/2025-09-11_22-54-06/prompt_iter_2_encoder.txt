Generate concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem, preserving all original class names, function names, and their nesting structures exactly as in the source code. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand, using natural language enriched with symbolic notations and common abbreviations. Emphasize compactness and clarity by favoring one-line statements and minimal verbosity. Do not include any comments, explanations, summaries, or descriptions—output only the pseudocode itself. Follow this exact numbered step format without separators:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use clear, simple control structures and straightforward variable assignments. Retain function and class signatures as in the original. Avoid verbose phrases and redundant detail. Complete the response efficiently within 5 seconds for best results.
