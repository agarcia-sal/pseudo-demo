Generate clear, concise pseudocode for the given problem that preserves all original class names, function names, and their exact nesting and signature structure. Use natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep the pseudocode high-level and easily understandable. Prefer compact one-line statements and minimize verbosity without losing essential detail. Output only the pseudocode—no comments, explanations, summaries, or extra text. Follow this exact numbered step format (no separators):

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Maintain consistent indentation reflecting code structure. Use simple control flows and straightforward assignments. Preserve all original class and function signatures precisely. Avoid redundant wording and do not rephrase or rename identifiers. Ensure output completion within 5 seconds for best performance.
