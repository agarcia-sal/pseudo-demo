Generate concise, clear pseudocode from the given code using predominantly natural language enhanced with common symbols and abbreviations. Preserve all original class and function names, parameters, and indentation exactly as in the source, reflecting class/object structures precisely. Write compact, high-level statements, favoring single-line expressions that combine conditions and actions where natural. Use generalized pseudocode constructs easily understood without language-specific syntax or ambiguous forms. Do not add input/output commands unless present in the original code. Number every line starting at 1, following this exact format with no extra text, comments, separators, or explanations:

1. let n ‚Üê 0  
2. while n < limit: n++

Output only the pseudocode, omitting summaries, explanations, or clarifications. Keep the output self-contained and immediately interpretable. Complete efficiently within 5 seconds.
