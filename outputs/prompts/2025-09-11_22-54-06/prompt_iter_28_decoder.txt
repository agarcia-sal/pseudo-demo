```python
Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, clean, idiomatic, fully executable Python solution enclosed in a single Python code block (```python ... ```).  
Your translation must strictly follow these enhanced, comprehensive guidelines:

- Preserve **all** original class names, method/function names, signatures, argument order and types, and structural nesting verbatim as presented in the pseudocode.  
- Convert every variant of null-like literals (`null`, `Null`, `NULL`, `none`, `None`, etc.) in pseudocode or sample inputs into Python’s `None`. Handle this conversion robustly at the top level so user inputs containing `null` can be passed directly to your solution code without further modification or causing exceptions.  
- Automatically detect **all complex data structures** (e.g., linked lists, binary trees, graphs, N-ary trees) from context, parameter names, or standard LeetCode-style conventions (such as `ListNode`, `TreeNode`, adjacency lists, etc.). For each:
  - Provide minimal, fully featured Python helper classes (e.g. `ListNode`, `TreeNode`) with modern Python 3.9+ type hints and dataclasses where appropriate, including all essential constructor parameters.  
  - Write robust, reusable converter functions that convert common input representations (e.g., nested Python lists with embedded `None`s, arrays, tuples, or dicts for graphs) into these data structures. These converters must safely handle any edge cases, including empty inputs, malformed data, unexpected types, excessive nesting, or `None` values, ensuring no runtime errors occur.
  - Inside every solution method that accepts complex structure inputs, implement **internal, defensive preprocessing** to detect raw, non-structured inputs (e.g., list[int] for a tree root) and convert them invisibly before executing solution logic, so users never need to pre-process inputs externally.  
- Support multiple common data structure types uniformly and independently — binary trees, linked lists (singly and doubly), graphs (directed/undirected), N-ary trees, and others commonly seen in pseudocode problems.  
- Import **only** from Python’s standard library, except when a well-known, minimal, widely accepted third-party library (e.g., `dataclasses`) significantly improves clarity or robustness; avoid any dependencies otherwise.  
- Rigorously handle **all edge cases and invalid inputs** gracefully:
  - Empty inputs or empty containers, e.g. `[]`
  - Inputs where expected nodes/values are `None`
  - Non-list inputs or malformed nested data structures
  - Mixed type elements or nesting irregularities  
  Ensure correctness, consistent behavior, and zero runtime exceptions regardless of input.  
- Write idiomatic, clean, and maintainable Python 3.9+ code; use modern features such as type hints (`from typing import ...`), `@dataclass` for simple data classes, `collections` efficiently (e.g., `deque`), and expressive comprehensions.  
- Avoid inefficient or redundant code, but **prioritize readability and correctness** over micro-optimizations.  
- Add clear, succinct comments only for subtle, non-obvious portions to maximize maintainability and understandability.  
- Place **all** your code, including import statements, helper classes, converters, and solution classes, inside a **single contiguous Python code block** starting with ```python and ending with ```.  
- Do **not** output any additional text, markdown, explanation, or separators outside this code block.  
- Ensure the output Python code runs as-is, correctly handling typical test scenarios from the pseudocode and ready to be tested on hidden test cases without modification or preprocessing.  
- Retain original method and class formatting and spacing as given in the pseudocode but format consistently and cleanly per Python conventions.  
- For built-in operators in pseudocode (e.g., XOR), map to Python idiomatic operators (`^`), and implement any implicit logic explicitly and correctly.  
- Your final code must act as a fully self-contained solution: **automatically parse, validate, and convert raw inputs internally as needed**, then perform the required computations, returning or printing results exactly as per pseudocode specification.

Return only a pristine, fully functional Python code block with the entire translated solution.
