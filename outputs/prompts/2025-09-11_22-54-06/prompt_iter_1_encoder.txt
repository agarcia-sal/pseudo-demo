Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Prefer one-liners and compact statements. Do not include purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format precisely:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure your pseudocode uses simple control structures and clear variable assignments without verbose phrasing. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible output within this limit.
