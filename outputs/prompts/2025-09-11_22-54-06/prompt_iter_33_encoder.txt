Generate concise, clear, high-level pseudocode from the given code, preserving all original class and function names, parameters, and nesting exactly as in the source. Use mainly natural language with standard symbols and common abbreviations. Favor compact one-line statements whenever possible, combining conditions and actions. Express control flow and data operations simply yet precisely without verbosity or summaries. Number each output line sequentially in this exact format with no extra text, comments, separators, or explanations:

1. let n ‚Üê 0  
2. while n < limit: n++

Retain all class and function signatures verbatim with their original indentation. Reflect data structures and control flow faithfully but in concise, readable terms. Avoid ambiguous or language-specific syntax, using generalized pseudocode constructs understandable on their own. Do not include input/output commands unless they appear explicitly in the original code. The output should be self-contained and independently interpretable. Complete efficiently within 5 seconds.
