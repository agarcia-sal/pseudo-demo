Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode from the given code, preserving all original class names, function names, parameters, and their nesting structure exactly as in the source. Keep the pseudocode compact and readable, using mostly natural language combined with standard symbols and widely recognized abbreviations. Favor one-line statements with combined conditions and actions when appropriate. Represent control flow and data operations directly and precisely without added explanations, summaries, or clarifications. Do not include any input/output operations unless explicitly present in the original code. Number each pseudocode line sequentially starting from 1 in this exact format with no extra text, comments, separators, or notes:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Maintain verbatim class and function signatures with original indentation and accurately reflect data structures and control flow. Use generalized pseudocode constructs that are language-agnostic and unambiguous. The output must be fully self-contained and independently understandable. Complete the task efficiently within 5 seconds.
