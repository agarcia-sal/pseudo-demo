Evaluate the following pseudocode carefully and decide if it is fully reproducible, meaning that it contains all necessary steps, is unambiguous, logically complete, and correct to pass **all** unit tests without any assumptions, extra information, or missing details.  
Your output must be exactly one digit:  
- **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible as defined,  
- **0** otherwise.  

There must be **no explanations, no additional characters, and no whitespace** other than this single digit in your output.  
When multiple pseudocode inputs are given sequentially, your outputs must correspond exactly in order, one digit per pseudocode.
