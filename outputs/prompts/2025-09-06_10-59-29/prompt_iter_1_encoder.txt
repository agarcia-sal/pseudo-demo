Write pseudocode that directly implements the solution to the given problem without any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not include comments or explanatory notes. Use concise, high-level, easy-to-read language with natural phrasing, employing one-liners, symbolic operators, and standard abbreviations. Follow the format of numbered steps like:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Keep pseudocode compact and focused purely on the logic and control flow. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to produce the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
