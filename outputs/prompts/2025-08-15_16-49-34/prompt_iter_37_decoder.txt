Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python code that strictly and accurately implements all described operations and logic. Your solution must adhere to these requirements:

- Output your entire solution inside a single Python code block using triple backticks and the language specifier:  
  ```python  
  ...  
  ```  
- Use only bare `input()` calls or optimized alternatives such as `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')` if appropriate to maximize input reading speed; do not include any prompt strings or extraneous output before reading input.  
- Minimize unnecessary comments, blank lines, or any non-functional code; include only what is essential for correctness, clarity, and optimal performance.  
- Use Python standard libraries and built-ins liberally to implement the solution as efficiently and concisely as possible. Third-party packages are allowed only if they are part of the Python Standard Library.  
- Accurately reflect the pseudocodeâ€™s control flow and data processing while exploiting Pythonic idioms, comprehensions, concise constructs, and fast I/O techniques to meet the strict 5-second runtime limit.  
- Your code should be immediately runnable without any modification or scaffolding, yielding the exact output implied by the pseudocode.
