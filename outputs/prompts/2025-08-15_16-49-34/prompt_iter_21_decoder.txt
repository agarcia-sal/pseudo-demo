Translate the provided pseudocode into clear, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that exactly replicates the original algorithmâ€™s logic and behavior. Your solution must:

- Use only `input()` for reading inputs without any prompt strings.
- Avoid any unnecessary comments, blank lines, or separator lines.
- Enclose the entire code in a single Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.
- Apply Python best practices for readability and performance, leveraging any relevant Python Standard Library modules or widely adopted packages when they improve clarity or efficiency.
- Produce code that is runnable as-is without additional modification.
- Optimize for correctness and computational efficiency, mindful of a strict 5-second runtime limit.
- Ensure well-structured control flow and data handling that map directly to the pseudocode steps.
