Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python code that precisely reproduces the logic and functionality of the original algorithm. Your output must meet all the following requirements:

- Use `input()` exactly as is for all inputs, without any prompt strings or extra text.
- Do **not** include comments, blank lines, or any separator lines; output only the minimal working code.
- Enclose the entire code snippet in a single, properly formatted Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.
- Prioritize correctness and performance within a strict 5-second execution time limit.
- Utilize Python’s Standard Library and widely used third-party libraries when they can shorten, clarify, or optimize your solution—import them explicitly as needed.
- Maintain a clear, direct mapping from the pseudocode to your code’s control flow and data structures, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- Ensure your code runs as-is without requiring any modifications to input/output or dependencies.
