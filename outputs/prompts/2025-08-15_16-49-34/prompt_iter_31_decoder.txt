Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that precisely implements the described logic. Your output must meet the following criteria:

- Enclose your entire solution within a single Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```  
- Use only bare `input()` calls for reading input; do not include any prompt strings or extraneous output before input.  
- Avoid all extraneous comments, blank lines, or any kind of separator lines—only include code essential for functionality.  
- Strive for correctness, clarity, and optimal performance, mindful of a strict 5-second runtime limit.  
- Use Python’s built-in functions and standard libraries freely whenever they improve readability or efficiency, including `sys.stdin.readline` for faster input if appropriate.  
- Ensure control flow and data transformations directly mirror the pseudocode steps while taking advantage of Pythonic constructs and idioms.  
- Your code must be runnable immediately without requiring modifications.
