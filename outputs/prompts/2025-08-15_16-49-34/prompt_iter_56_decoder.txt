Translate the provided pseudocode into a single, complete, and immediately executable Python program enclosed strictly within a triple-backtick python code block (```python ... ```). Produce only code—no explanations, comments, extra output, blank lines, or any formatting beyond the code block itself.

Your translation must:

- Faithfully implement the pseudocode’s logic and output exactly.
- Optimize for performance and clarity using idiomatic, concise Python constructs.
- Use `input()` for reading inputs unless the problem scale or context strongly implies large input volumes; in such cases, use `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')`.
- Utilize appropriate data structures, built-in functions, comprehensions, generator expressions, and standard libraries (`sys`, `collections`, `itertools`, `heapq`, `bisect`, `math`, `functools`, `operator`, `re`, etc.) or well-known third-party packages if beneficial.
- Avoid redundant variables, repeated computations, and verbose constructs.
- Name variables clearly and meaningfully; preserve pseudocode variable names if given.
- Manage all necessary imports compactly at the top of the code block only.
- Ensure the code runs correctly and efficiently within typical competitive programming constraints and Python’s 5-second timeout.
- Produce no debug prints, prompts, separators, or explanations—output exactly as the pseudocode specifies.
