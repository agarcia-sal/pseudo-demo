Translate the given pseudocode into idiomatic, clean, and efficient Python code that precisely preserves the original logic. Use standard Python conventions and ensure the code is ready to run as-is, reading inputs with plain `input()` calls without any prompt strings. You may leverage any Python standard library or widely used packages if they help optimize clarity or performance. Avoid extraneous comments or separator lines, and enclose your entire code solution within a single Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```. Prioritize readability, correctness, and computational efficiency, delivering your complete response within 5 seconds. Here is the pseudocode to translate:
