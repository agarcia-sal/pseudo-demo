Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python code that precisely implements the described algorithm. Your solution must:

- Use `input()` without any prompt strings for all inputs.
- Avoid unnecessary comments, blank lines, or separator lines.
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block formatted as ```python ... ```.
- Prioritize concise, readable, and performant code using Pythonic constructs and the standard library. You may employ any widely used Python packages if they meaningfully enhance clarity or efficiency.
- Generate code ready to run immediately, requiring no modifications.
- Carefully structure control flow and data handling to directly reflect the pseudocode logic.
- Optimize to run correctly within a strict 5-second time constraint, utilizing efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Handle all subtleties and edge cases implicit in the pseudocode, including input normalization or parsing as needed.
