Translate the given pseudocode into a single, self-contained, and immediately runnable Python script enclosed in a single code block formatted as ```python ... ```. Your translation must strictly adhere to the following criteria:

- Use plain `input()` for reading all input unless the pseudocode or context clearly implies very large input, in which case use the fastest appropriate standard input method (e.g., `sys.stdin.readline()`), importing modules only if needed.
- Produce only the minimal necessary code that exactly implements the pseudocodeâ€™s logic and output, with zero extraneous comments, prompts, blank lines, or console messages.
- Optimize for readability and performance by using Pythonic idioms (comprehensions, built-ins, unpacking), efficient data structures, and standard or widely accepted third-party libraries if they improve clarity, correctness, or runtime speed.
- Avoid unnecessary computations, redundant variable assignments, or verbose constructs; instead aim for code that is both clear and performant.
- Preserve any subtle logic or edge-case behavior implied by the pseudocode without alteration.
- Do not add any extra output formatting beyond what the pseudocode specifies.
- Ensure your code runs within 5 seconds on typical input sizes implied by the pseudocode.
- Import only what is strictly necessary for the solution.
- Do not include separator lines or extraneous formatting in your output.
