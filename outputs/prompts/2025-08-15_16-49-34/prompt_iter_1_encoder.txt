Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should use natural language with symbolic shortcuts and abbreviations, be compact and high-level, avoid comments, explanations, purpose statements, summaries, or overviews. Use mostly one-liners and clear control flow resembling this style:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Follow this format strictly. Output only the pseudocode without any additional text or notes. Your function has a 5-second timeout; prioritize clear, efficient pseudocode within this limit.
