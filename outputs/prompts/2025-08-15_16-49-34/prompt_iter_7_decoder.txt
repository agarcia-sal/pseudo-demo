Translate the following pseudocode into idiomatic, well-structured, and optimized Python code. Your translation must:

- Preserve the exact logic and flow of the pseudocode.
- Be concise, readable, and efficient, using Pythonic constructs and standard libraries where appropriate.
- Handle all input using plain `input()` calls without prompt strings.
- Include necessary imports explicitly if used.
- Enclose the entire translated code within a single fenced Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.
- Avoid extraneous comments or separator lines.
- Prioritize clarity and correctness over unnecessary optimization but apply common-sense improvements (e.g., proper integer division, avoiding redundant variables, using built-in functions).
- Complete the translation within 5 seconds.
