Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and efficient Python 3 code. Your translation must strictly preserve the original logic and flow, produce fully runnable code, and handle inputs using raw calls to `input()` without prompt strings. Use Python standard libraries freely if they help simplify or optimize the implementation. Format your entire code inside a single Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```. Avoid adding explanations, comments, or any text outside the code block. Prioritize code clarity, correctness, and efficiency, and ensure your response completes within 5 seconds. Here is the pseudocode:
