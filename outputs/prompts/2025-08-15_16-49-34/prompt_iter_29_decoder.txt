Translate the given pseudocode into idiomatic, optimized, and fully runnable Python code that precisely implements the original logic. Your code must:

- Read all inputs strictly via `input()` (no prompt strings).
- Produce output exactly as implied by the pseudocode.
- Use clear, concise syntax with no extra comments, unnecessary blank lines, or separators.
- Enclose the complete solution within a single Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.
- Leverage Python standard libraries or well-known packages only when they improve clarity or performance without compromising simplicity.
- Maintain clean control flow directly mirroring the pseudocode structure with appropriately named variables.
- Optimize both runtime efficiency and memory usage to meet a strict 5-second time constraint on typical inputs.
- Avoid assumptions about input format beyond what is stated in the pseudocodeâ€”handle edge cases robustly.
- Deliver code that requires no edits and can be run immediately as-is in a Python 3 environment.
