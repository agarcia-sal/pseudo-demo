Translate the given pseudocode into fully executable, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that strictly preserves the original logic. 

- Use only plain `input()` calls for reading input, without any embedded prompt strings or extra output.  
- Write concise, clean, and readable code while maximizing runtime efficiency and memory use.  
- Leverage Python’s standard library and widely used packages where they enhance clarity or performance—avoid reinventing well-known functionality.  
- Avoid unnecessary comments or decorative separators; deliver only the logically essential code.  
- Enclose your entire solution within a single Python code block using triple backticks and the language identifier ```python ... ```.  
- Ensure the code runs correctly as-is and returns the precise outputs implied by the pseudocode, adhering exactly to all control flows, data transformations, and computations indicated.  
- Keep your response focused and minimal; do not output explanations or supplementary text.  
- Your execution time constraint is 5 seconds; optimize accordingly.
