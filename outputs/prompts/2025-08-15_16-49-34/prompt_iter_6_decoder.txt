Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and well-structured Python code that precisely implements the described logic. Prioritize correctness, readability, and efficiency. Use meaningful variable names consistent with the pseudocode, but adapt syntax appropriately to Python conventions. Enclose your entire solution within a single Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.  
- Your code should handle inputs using plain `input()` calls without prompts or messages.  
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries if they help maintain clarity or performance.  
- Avoid adding explanations, comments, or any text outside the code block.  
- Ensure your translation is faithful to the pseudocode logic and completes within 5 seconds.
