Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that exactly replicates the given logic. Your code must:

- Use standard Python coding conventions and best practices, prioritizing readability, correctness, and performance.
- Handle input exactly as shown, using plain `input()` calls without any prompt strings.
- Include all necessary imports explicitly if external Python standard libraries or widely accepted third-party packages improve clarity or efficiency.
- Avoid any unnecessary comments, blank lines, or separator lines.
- Output only the complete solution enclosed in a single Python code block: start with ```python and end with ```.
- Optimize variable naming and control structures to be both concise and expressive.
- Assume your solution will be executed within a strict 5-second runtime limit, so strive for computational efficiency without sacrificing code clarity.
