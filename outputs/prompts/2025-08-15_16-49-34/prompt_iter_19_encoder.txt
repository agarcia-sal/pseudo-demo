Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description.  
- Use mostly one-line statements with simple indentation for nested blocks.  
- Express control flow naturally with keywords: let, set, read, print, if, else, for, while, break, return.  
- Use symbolic operators: ← for assignment, =, ≠ for comparison, +, –, *, /, mod for arithmetic.  
- Use common variable abbreviations like idx, cnt, rv, tmp.  
- Keep pseudocode compact, high-level, and focused on core logic only—no comments, explanations, summaries, or notes.  
- Number lines sequentially starting at 1.  
- Avoid separator lines, extra formatting, or verbose statements.  
- Prefer natural language phrasing but keep it minimal and precise.  

Follow exactly this style:

1. let n be integer  
2. read n  
3. cnt ← 0  
4. for i in 1 to n:  
5.  if i mod 2 = 0: cnt ← cnt + 1  
6. print cnt
