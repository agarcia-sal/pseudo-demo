Translate the given pseudocode into idiomatic, well-structured, and efficient Python code.  
- Preserve the exact logic and intent of the pseudocode without introducing unrelated functionality.  
- Use concise and clear variable names consistent with the pseudocode.  
- Handle input exactly as described, using `input()` with no prompts or extra arguments.  
- Include imports if and only if they are necessary for the implementation.  
- Avoid explanatory comments, but write clean, readable code that a Python developer would understand immediately.  
- Conform to Python conventions (PEP8) and use appropriate constructs (e.g., `for`, `while`, comprehensions, built-ins).  
- Return your entire code snippet enclosed within a Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.  
- Do not add any extra text outside the code block.
