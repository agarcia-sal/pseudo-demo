Translate the given pseudocode into fully executable Python code with these requirements:

- Use the exact function name and parameter names as specified in the pseudocode.
- Include all necessary support classes, helper functions, and imports that are required by your implementation.
- Write clean, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that runs correctly within 5 seconds.
- Ensure the output code is self-contained and runnable as-is without any external dependencies beyond the Python standard library or commonly preinstalled packages.
- Do not wrap your solution in any additional classes unless explicitly shown in the pseudocode.
- Return the complete solution enclosed within a single Python code block using the syntax below.
- Do not include extra explanations, comments outside the code block, or extra formatting such as separator lines.
- Ensure that the returned code can be directly called or tested without references to undefined variables or classes (e.g., do not assume a 'Solution' class unless part of the pseudocode).
- Complete all control structures and handle all edge cases as implied by the pseudocode.
- Add type hints if they appear naturally and improve clarity, but only if present or suggested by pseudocode; otherwise, keep signatures as in pseudocode.
- If pseudocode uses commonly known data structures or concepts (e.g., linked lists), implement necessary class definitions explicitly.
