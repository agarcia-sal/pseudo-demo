Generate pseudocode that is clear, compact, and easy to read, using mostly natural language enriched with symbolic operators and concise abbreviations. Preserve the original function name exactly as given. Write mostly one-line, high-level statements expressing logic with minimal lines while maintaining clarity. Use simple numbering and indentation for blocks. Do not add any comments, explanations, summaries, or notes—output only pure pseudocode. Avoid separators or headers. Follow this exact format and style:

1. functionName(params)  
2. x ← 0  
3. while x < n: x++

Use short but descriptive variable names, symbolic conditions, and control structures. Emphasize brevity with readability, prioritizing expressions in one line whenever possible. Keep the entire output strictly limited to actionable pseudocode within 5 seconds.
