Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language, one-liners, symbolic operators, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode steps themselves. Follow this format with step numbering:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your pseudocode should directly address the problem logic within a 5-second response time.
