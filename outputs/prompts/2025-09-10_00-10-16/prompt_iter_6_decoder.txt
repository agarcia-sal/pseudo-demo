Translate the given pseudocode into Python code with the following requirements:

- Implement the function using the exact same function name and parameters as described in the pseudocode.
- Include any necessary supporting classes or imports that the solution depends on.
- Write clean, readable, and efficient Python code optimized to run within 5 seconds.
- Do not wrap your solution inside any extra classes unless explicitly shown in the pseudocode.
- Provide fully self-contained code that can be executed as-is without external dependencies beyond the standard library (you may import standard Python packages if appropriate).
- Enclose your entire solution in a single Python code block using the syntax below.
- Do not include any explanatory text, comments outside the code block, or separator lines.
