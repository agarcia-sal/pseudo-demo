Translate the given pseudocode into complete, ready-to-run Python code with the following strict instructions:

- Preserve the exact function name and parameter names as given in the pseudocode.
- Include all necessary imports, helper functions, and support class definitions explicitly—do not assume anything is predefined.
- Provide a fully self-contained solution that can be executed as-is without any external dependencies beyond Python’s standard library and widely preinstalled packages.
- Do NOT encapsulate the solution inside any classes unless the pseudocode explicitly defines such a class.
- Complete all control structures fully, handle all implied edge cases rigorously, and ensure the code is logically correct and efficient.
- Add type hints only if they clearly align with or improve understanding based on the pseudocode’s context.
- Return ONLY the Python code, enclosed within a single code block like below, without any extra explanation, comments outside the code, or decorative formatting.
