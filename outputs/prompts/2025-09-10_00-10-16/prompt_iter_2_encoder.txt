Generate concise, high-level pseudocode directly from the problem description, preserving the original function name exactly. The pseudocode must be clear, readable, and expressed primarily in natural language with efficient use of symbolic operators, abbreviations, and one-liners to maximize compactness and clarity. Avoid any comments, explanations, purpose statements, summaries, or notes—output only numbered pseudocode steps. Format steps with simple numbering and indentation for blocks, using minimal lines while fully capturing the logic.  
Example format:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Ensure variables and control flows are clearly expressed; use natural phrasing but keep brevity. Do not include separators or extraneous text. Focus on producing directly actionable pseudocode within 5 seconds.
