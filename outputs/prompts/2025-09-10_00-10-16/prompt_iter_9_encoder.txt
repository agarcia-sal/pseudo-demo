Generate clear, concise pseudocode from the problem description, preserving the exact original function name. The pseudocode must be compact, high-level, and predominantly natural language enriched with symbolic operators and abbreviations. Express logic primarily in one-liners where possible to maximize brevity without sacrificing clarity. Use simple numbering and indentation for blocks, no comments, explanations, summaries, or extra notes—only numbered pseudocode lines. Prefer natural, readable phrasing with concise variable names and control flow constructs. Follow this exact formatting style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Begin pseudocode with the function name as in the original code, e.g.:  
1. functionName(params)  

Then proceed with algorithm steps using minimal lines and clear logic. Do not add separators, headers, or extraneous text. Keep output strictly to actionable pseudocode within 5 seconds.
