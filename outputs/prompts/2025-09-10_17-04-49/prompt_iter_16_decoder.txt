```python
Translate the provided pseudocode into fully runnable, idiomatic, and efficient Python 3 code, strictly preserving all class names, method/function names, parameter names, and their exact hierarchy and signatures as given.

Enclose your entire output within a single Python code block as follows:
```python
# your translated Python code here
```

Follow these comprehensive, enforceable directives to maximize correctness, robustness, readability, and performance:

1. Names and Structure:
   - Retain all class names, method names, parameter names, and method signatures exactly as presented; do NOT change names, reorder parameters, or alter class hierarchies.
   - Preserve all type hints from the pseudocode; if missing but logically clear, add precise Python 3 type annotations.
   - Maintain @staticmethod or @classmethod decorators exactly where pseudocode implies or requires.

2. Syntax and Semantic Accuracy:
   - Convert all pseudocode syntax into valid Python syntax:
     * Assignments use `=`
     * Null/nil/None/`null` everywhere become Python `None`
     * Boolean constructs map correctly to Python truth values (`True`, `False`)
     * Control flow (if, for, while) converted properly and indented correctly
   - Use Python native types and idioms for clarity and performance (e.g., list comprehensions, unpacking, generators).
   - Avoid any pseudocode tokens such as `null` or `nil` in output; only use Python `None`.

3. Input Processing and Safety:
   - **Automatically detect any input parameter(s) potentially representing trees, linked lists, or graphs expressed as nested lists with `None` placeholders.**
   - For such inputs, internally convert them into their respective class instances at the very start of the method before any usage.
   - This prevents runtime errors like attribute access on raw lists.
   - Do NOT assume inputs are already class instances; always do these conversions internally, transparently to calling code.
   - If a tree or list class is used but no builder/conversion function is defined, create a robust builder function inside the appropriate class (as @staticmethod or standalone helper near the class).
   - These builder functions must handle empty lists, incomplete/skewed structures, and all edge cases.

4. Custom Data Structures and Builders:
   - Provide canonical, idiomatic Python class definitions for standard structures encountered (e.g., ListNode for linked lists, TreeNode for binary trees, GraphNode as needed), including `__init__` with type hints.
   - Include well-tested, production-grade builder methods for these data structures that convert from typical test input forms (lists with None) to fully linked instances.
   - These builders must never raise exceptions for valid input, and must always create a correct, usable in-memory structure.

5. Imports and Dependencies:
   - Import only the minimal necessary standard libraries to ensure correctness and efficiency (e.g., typing, collections, heapq, math, itertools).
   - Use explicit imports from `typing` for Optional, List, Dict, Tuple as required by type hints.

6. Performance and Clarity:
   - Use Pythonic, optimal algorithms and data structures wherever possible, balancing runtime efficiency with code clarity.
   - Avoid redundant operations and excessive memory usage.
   - Use generators, comprehensions, cached computations, and built-in library functions for speed and readability.

7. Output Format:
   - Output only one contiguous Python code block containing the complete translated solution with the correct classes, methods, and supporting code.
   - Do NOT include any explanations, comments (beyond minimal inline clarifications if absolutely necessary), or separators.
   - The code should be directly runnable and submit-ready.

By rigorously following these detailed guidelines, your translation will be accurate, robust against corner cases, safe against attribute errors on raw inputs, and performant for production or competitive use.
