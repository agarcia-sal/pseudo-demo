Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, notes, or comments—just the pseudocode. Use easy-to-read natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Prefer one-liners and compact expressions. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and brevity in all steps. Your output should be structured and ordered logically, focusing solely on the algorithm. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
