```python
Translate the input pseudocode into complete, executable, idiomatic, and efficient Python 3 code, strictly preserving all class names, method/function names, parameters, signatures, and hierarchies exactly as given.

Follow these enhanced, mandatory instructions carefully to produce robust, clear, performant, and test-ready code:

1. Identity & Structure Preservation:
   - Keep all class names, method/function names, parameter names, and full signatures exactly as in the pseudocode; do NOT rename, reorder, or restructure them.
   - Retain all class inheritance and nesting structure exactly.
   - Preserve existing decorators such as @staticmethod and @classmethod precisely.

2. Precise Type Annotations:
   - Preserve all existing type hints exactly.
   - If missing or partial annotations can be logically inferred, add clear, precise Python 3 type hints using standard conventions.
   - Import required typing elements explicitly (e.g. List, Optional, Dict, Tuple) only as needed.

3. Correct Syntax & Semantics:
   - Replace all pseudocode tokens (e.g., null, nil) with Python-native equivalents (`None`).
   - Translate pseudocode control flow (if, elif, else, for, while) into valid, properly indented Python.
   - Use Python assignment syntax `=`.
   - Translate booleans to `True`/`False` correctly.
   - Convert data structures to Python built-in types and idiomatic patterns (e.g., list comprehensions, unpacking).
   - Eliminate any pseudocode leftover tokens or non-Python conventions.

4. Input Normalization and Safe Conversions:
   - Detect input parameters expected to represent trees, linked lists, or graphs, typically given as nested or flat lists that include `None` placeholders (e.g. `[1,2,null,3]`).
   - Internally convert such raw inputs into their corresponding in-memory class instances at the very start of each relevant method, transparently to caller code.
   - Do NOT assume inputs are pre-constructed objects or nodes; always safely build them internally.
   - For trees (binary or N-ary), linked lists, or graph nodes, if no builder/conversion method is given, implement robust, canonical @staticmethod builder functions inside the relevant classes.
   - These builder functions must handle all edge cases, including empty inputs, missing children, skewed or incomplete structures; never raise exceptions on valid input.
   - Use breadth-first search (BFS) or suitable algorithms to construct structures correctly from list inputs.
   - Ensure builder function names reflect intuitive naming like `from_list`, `build_tree`, `build_linked_list`.

5. Canonical Data Structure Classes:
   - Provide, if needed, canonical class definitions for widely used data structures encountered in inputs or problems:
       * `ListNode` for singly-linked lists
       * `TreeNode` for binary trees
       * `GraphNode` or appropriate for graphs (if applicable)
   - These classes must have clear, typed `__init__` methods, following Python conventions.
   - Include robust, production-quality builder methods to create instances from test-style list inputs with `None`.
   - Place these classes and builders before the main solution classes.

6. Minimal, Explicit Imports:
   - Import only standard Python libraries absolutely necessary for the solution (e.g., typing, collections, heapq, math, itertools).
   - Import specific objects from typing explicitly (e.g. `from typing import List, Optional`).
   - Avoid wildcard imports or unused imports.

7. Performance & Readability:
   - Write efficient code using Python's built-ins, comprehensions, generators, caching where appropriate.
   - Avoid unnecessary variable copying and redundant passes.
   - Use clear variable naming for readability without redundancy.
   - Balance optimal algorithms with code clarity.

8. Output Format and Constraints:
   - Output ONLY one contiguous Python code block surrounded by triple backticks ```
   - Do NOT add explanations, comments (except minimal inline clarifications if absolutely necessary), or divider lines.
   - The full solution must be directly runnable and submission-ready.
   - Keep all given function, method, and class interfaces exactly as the pseudocode has specified.
   - Do NOT assume the presence of any code outside what you output.

By following these enhanced guidelines strictly, your translated code will be syntactically correct, robust to all corner cases including raw nested input forms, idiomatic, and efficientâ€”ready for immediate, error-free use in testing, production, or competitive programming environments.
