Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be high-level and use natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations when appropriate. Use mostly one-liners and avoid verbose constructions. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and compactness, focusing on the core logic. Your response should be returned within a 5-second timeout.
