Given the pseudocode below, determine if it is explicitly complete, unambiguous, and directly translatable into correct, fully functioning, and test-compliant code that will pass **all unit tests for every valid input** without needing any external assumptions, interpretation, or additional context.

Base your assessment strictly on these criteria:

1. **Explicit completeness:** All function and data inputs, outputs, intermediate steps, and state changes are clearly and exhaustively defined with no omissions.  
2. **Logical correctness:** The pseudocode’s algorithm accurately implements the problem requirements under all normal and edge cases, producing correct results.  
3. **Unambiguity and determinism:** Every operation, control flow decision, and data manipulation is precisely described with no vagueness, conflicting statements, or undefined behavior.  
4. **Proper control flow:** Loops, conditionals, and recursion are well-structured, terminate appropriately, and handle every possible scenario—no infinite loops, dead code, or missing branches.  
5. **Implementation readiness:** The pseudocode can be reliably converted into executable code without requiring assumptions about data types, environments, naming conventions, or hidden details.  
6. **Robustness and error handling:** Boundary cases, exceptional conditions, and potentially invalid inputs (where relevant) are addressed so that all unit tests, including edge cases, are satisfied.

**Instructions:**  
- Examine each pseudocode input in the exact order supplied.  
- For each, output **only one character**: `1` if the pseudocode meets all criteria and is reproducibly correct, or `0` otherwise.  
- Do not provide explanations, comments, or any other text.
