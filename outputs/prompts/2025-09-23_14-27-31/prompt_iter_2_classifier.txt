Given the pseudocode below, your task is to determine whether it is precisely and unambiguously reproducibleâ€”that is, whether the pseudocode can be straightforwardly implemented as working code that will pass **all** unit tests for every valid input without any logical flaws, omissions, or ambiguities.  
To do this, carefully evaluate whether:  
- All required inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps are clearly defined and complete  
- The control flow and operations are logically sound and sufficient for correctness  
- There are no missing conditions, infinite loops, or undefined behaviors  
- The pseudocode can be consistently translated into executable code without the need for assumptions or external context  

**Output a single digit: `1` if the pseudocode is reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests; otherwise, output `0`.**  

Your response must be exactly one character (`1` or `0`) and must not include any explanations, comments, or additional text.  
The outputs you provide for multiple pseudocode inputs will be considered in the same order as the inputs are given.
