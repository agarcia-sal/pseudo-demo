Given the pseudocode below, determine if it is fully reproducible: specifically, whether it can be implemented exactly as described—without requiring any assumptions, external information, or clarifications—and will function correctly to pass **all** unit tests for **every** valid input.  
To decide, rigorously check that the pseudocode:  
- Clearly and completely specifies all inputs, outputs, and every intermediate operation needed  
- Defines all control flows, conditions, loops, and computations unambiguously and cohesively  
- Lacks logical errors, missing cases, infinite loops, or undefined/ambiguous behaviors  
- Can be directly translated into executable code that behaves as intended under all inputs  

Considering these points, output exactly one character and nothing else:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests  
- `0` otherwise  

Your response must be a single `1` or `0`, with no explanation, formatting, or extra text.  
The outputs for multiple pseudocode inputs must be returned in the exact order they are given.
