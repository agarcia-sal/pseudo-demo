Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable, using natural language, one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow a clear numbered step format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your function must complete within 5 seconds; prioritize producing the best possible pseudocode within this constraint.
