Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce a rewritten version that **preserves all original functionalities, side effects, outputs, and hierarchical structure exactly**—including all function names, method signatures with parameter order and names, class names, and nesting—but appears as a completely independent, highly refactored, and lexically divergent implementation. Your rewritten pseudocode must maintain **strict semantic equivalence** with the original, satisfying these directives:

1. **Identifier Renaming:** Systematically rename every local variable, parameter, loop counter, and temporary placeholder to novel, semantically plausible names that differ entirely from the originals, ensuring no reused names except for function and class identifiers.

2. **Control Flow Transformation:** Replace each control structure with a semantically identical but structurally distinct alternative, such as but not limited to:
   - Convert `for` loops into `while` loops, recursion, or functional iteration constructs (e.g., map, filter patterns).
   - Re-implement `while` loops as `for` loops or recursion.
   - Replace nested conditionals with guard clauses, early returns, or De Morgan’s law equivalents.
   - Transform conditional expressions by logical inversion, De Morgan's laws, or predicate rearrangement.
   - Unroll or regroup loops and conditionals where it improves structural divergence.
   - Switch between different loop variable progression orderings or indexing methods.

3. **Expression Refactoring:** Rewrite all expressions (arithmetic, logical, relational) using alternative mathematically or logically equivalent forms, including:
   - Swapping operand order where commutative.
   - Introducing negations to simplify or invert expressions.
   - Using equivalent operations (e.g., `x != y` becomes `!(x == y)`).
   - Breaking complex expressions into multiple simpler steps or combining multiple steps into one.

4. **Data Access and Traversal Alteration:** Modify the means of iterating or accessing collections and data:
   - Swap index-based loops for element-iteration (e.g., iterator-based or for-each style loops).
   - Employ queues, stacks, recursion, or other data navigation schemes without changing results.
   - Change slicing, subsetting, or substring methods to alternative but equivalent constructs.

5. **Statement Reorganization and Grouping:** Reorder statements freely where no data dependencies exist, restructure compound statements by splitting or merging expressions, or reorder independent calculations while preserving output order where necessary.

6. **Formatting and Style Revamp:** Completely alter all surface-level formatting aspects:
   - Use different indentation styles and levels, whitespace patterns, and line breaks.
   - Change comment style, placement, or remove comments if present.
   - Vary grouping of statements, presence or absence of explicit block delimiters.

7. **Maintain API Stability:** Do not change any function or method signatures, class names or their nesting, global variables, or external interfaces. Do not add or remove functions or classes. Do not reorder functions or class declarations.

8. **Preserve Behavior and Outputs:** Ensure all I/O, return values, side effects, and output data structures remain semantically identical with identical ordering, including outputs of nested functions or method calls.

**Output Requirement:** Produce **only** the rewritten pseudocode snippet. **Do not include explanations, comments, notes, or annotations.**

Your goal is for the rewritten pseudocode to look like a fully independently authored implementation that accomplishes the exact same tasks flawlessly but exhibits maximal lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic departure from the original code.
