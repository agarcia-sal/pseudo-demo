Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a functionally identical pseudocode rewrite that strictly preserves all original behaviors, outputs, return values, class names, function names, method signatures, and class/method nesting exactly as in the original. Produce an independently authored version that achieves **maximum possible syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence** from the original snippet without altering any functionality:

- Systematically rename **every variable, parameter, and local identifier** to fresh, meaningful alternatives disjoint from original names.

- Remodel control flow by exhaustively applying these transformations where feasible:
  - Convert all loop types (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) into other semantically equivalent forms including recursion, comprehension-style iterations, or iterator-based loops.
  - Replace nested conditionals and multi-branch constructs with guard clauses, early returns, inverted logic (using Boolean algebra like De Morganâ€™s laws), `switch`/`case`-style alternatives, or flattened logical expressions.
  - Unroll or restructure loops and conditionals by splitting or merging statements while exactly preserving effects and order dependencies.
  - Use non-standard yet equivalent flow control patterns (e.g., replace index-based iteration with element iteration or recursion).

- Transform all expressions and computations by applying equivalent rewrites:
  - Swap operand order where order independence holds.
  - Apply algebraic and Boolean identities to rewrite expressions.
  - Replace operators with synonymous alternatives.
  - Rewrite complex expressions in simpler or differently nested forms.

- Reorder independent statements, rearrange series of operations, fuse or split expressions and intermediate calculations without affecting semantics or side effects.

- Change data structure iteration methods, replacing index-based access with iterator-based loops, recursive tree/graph traversals, or higher-level iteration constructs.

- Revise formatting styles thoroughly: vary indentation schemes, whitespace distribution, line breaks, statement grouping, comment placement and style (if present), while not removing existing comments.

- **Critically: Do not introduce, omit or reorder any functions, classes, or methods; do not modify their signatures including parameter names and order; do not change the hierarchy or nesting of classes and methods.**

- Preserve all input/output behavior flawlessly and ensure identical return values and side effects.

Your output must be **exclusively** the rewritten pseudocode snippet, with **no explanation, commentary, annotations, or extraneous text**.

**In summary:** Produce a carefully transformed, semantically equivalent pseudocode that appears as a wholly independent implementation with substantially different lexical, syntactic, and structural characteristics, while strictly retaining all original class/function names, signatures, placement, and behavior.
