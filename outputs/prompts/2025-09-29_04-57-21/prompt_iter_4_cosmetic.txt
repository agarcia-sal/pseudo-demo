Given an input pseudocode snippet, rewrite it to produce an output pseudocode that strictly preserves **all original functional behavior and logic** without any additions, removals, or alterations to function names, class names, method signatures, or their nested structure. Your rewritten version must be as syntactically and structurally **distinct** as possible from the input, employing comprehensive transformations including but not limited to:

- Fully renaming **variables, temporary identifiers, and parameters** to semantically meaningful but entirely different names.
- Converting one style of control flow to fundamentally different constructs (e.g., replacing `for` loops with equivalent `while` loops or recursion, flattening nested conditionals into guard clauses or switch/case statements, unrolling or regrouping loops, etc.).
- Rearranging computations, extracting or combining intermediate expressions, and changing calculation sequences internally as long as output logic remains the same.
- Rewriting all expressions using logically equivalent alternatives, including employing De Morganâ€™s laws, alternative arithmetic or logical identities, and different ordering of operands where allowed.
- Altering the formatting style thoroughly: indentation, spacing, line breaks, statement grouping, and comment removal/addition (if any comments exist).
- Changing the approach used for traversing data structures, replacing explicit index manipulation with iterators, or vice versa.
- Refactoring statement order and combining or splitting statements where semantic equivalence holds.
- Avoid changing the external API: keep all function and class signatures, returned values, and the overall class/object layout exactly as in the input.

Your output must be **only** the rewritten pseudocode, with no explanatory text, commentary, or annotations.

**Strictly do NOT modify:**  
- Function names  
- Class names and their hierarchical placement  
- Method signatures (names, parameters, order) and nesting  
- External behavior or outputs  

The goal is maximal syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence from the original pseudocode while maintaining exactly the same computed results and external API. Your rewritten pseudocode should look and feel like a completely different implementation that preserves the original contract perfectly.
