Given any input pseudocode snippet, produce a rewritten pseudocode version that matches **all original functionality exactly**, preserving every output, side-effect, and overall data flow, while strictly maintaining **all original function names, class names, their nested/hierarchical structure, and method signatures exactly as given** (including parameter names and order). The rewritten code must differ as radically as possible from the input in every other dimension, specifically by applying diverse, systematic, and thorough transformations such as:

- Replace **every variable, parameter, and temporary name** with fresh, context-appropriate alternatives that bear no superficial resemblance to the originals, yet remain meaningful.

- Restructure all control flow by leveraging semantically equivalent but syntactically distinct forms, including but not limited to:
  - Convert `for` loops to `while` loops, recursion, stream-like iterations, or comprehensions where applicable.
  - Replace nested `if`-`else` blocks with guard clauses, early returns, inverted conditionals, or switch/case constructs (or appropriate analogues).
  - Split, merge, unroll, or regroup loops and conditionals to alter their shape and sequencing without changing logic.

- Rewrite expressions extensively by applying alternative logical, arithmetic, and Boolean identities:
  - Use equivalent operator substitutions (e.g., replace `!=` with negated `==`, `a - b` with `a + (-b)`).
  - Leverage operand reordering, De Morgan’s laws, double negations, or equivalent numeric transforms.
  - Expand or compress complex expressions into stepwise calculations or condensed one-liners as fits.

- Change how data structures are traversed or manipulated:
  - Switch between index-based access, element iteration, iterator protocols, recursion, or built-in functional methods.
  - Re-express collection operations using different iteration orders, navigation techniques, or intermediate data structures.

- Reorganize independent computations by safely changing statement order, splitting or consolidating statements, and refactoring complex steps into smaller or larger units.

- Completely overhaul formatting and styling choices, including indentation patterns, line breaks, statement grouping, comment style and placement (if comments exist), and naming case conventions, ensuring the output’s visual structure is strikingly distinct yet semantically identical.

- Do not alter any class hierarchy, method or function name, method signatures or parameter lists, return statements, or the sequence and grouping of classes and methods.

Your final output must contain **only** the rewritten pseudocode snippet, **with no explanations, comments, or annotations whatsoever**.

This rewriting should produce a pseudocode implementation that looks independently authored and maximally divergent from the input at lexical, syntactic, and structural levels, while perfectly retaining all original behaviors and interfaces.
