Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce a rewritten pseudocode version that fully preserves **all** original functional behavior, logic flow, input/output relationships, function names, class names, method signatures (including nesting and order), and class/object hierarchies **exactly** as in the input.

Your rewritten pseudocode must achieve **maximum syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence** compared to the original code. To do so, apply deep, varied transformations such as but not limited to:

- Renaming **all** local variables, parameters, loop indices, and temporary identifiers to entirely different but semantically consistent names.
- Replacing all loops with equivalent forms (e.g., `for` ↔ `while`, loops ↔ recursion, loop unrolling/rolling, changing iteration order or step direction).
- Transforming conditionals by applying logical equivalences, De Morgan’s laws, negations or rearrangements, converting nested conditionals into guard clauses, switch/case-like constructs, or flattened structures.
- Changing traversal methods over data structures: from index-based to iterator/enumerator style and vice versa, or by using different traversal orders or techniques consistent with output.
- Refactoring computations by reorganizing expressions, factoring them differently, changing evaluation order, extracting or inlining intermediate results as long as semantics stay identical.
- Substituting all expressions with logically equivalent alternatives, including arithmetic identities, Boolean expression equivalences, reordered operands, alternative casting or conversions.
- Modifying statement groupings, splitting or combining statements, adjusting control flow while preserving program meaning and external behavior.
- Thoroughly altering formatting, spacing, indentation, line breaks, and optionally introducing, removing, or rewriting comments in a different style or language.
- Ensuring **no addition, removal, or change** to any function or class **names**, signatures, hierarchies, or their external behavior and API contracts.

Your output should **only** be the fully rewritten pseudocode, adhering strictly to these constraints, with **no explanatory text, notes, or metadata.**

This rewriting should result in a pseudocode version that looks and feels like an entirely independent implementation, while keeping the original external contract and computed results perfectly intact.
