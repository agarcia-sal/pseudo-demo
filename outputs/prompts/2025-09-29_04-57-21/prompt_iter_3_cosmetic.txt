Given the input pseudocode, generate a fully transformed version that retains **exactly the same behavior and functionality**, including all function signatures, class names, method names, and the exact class and object nesting/structure. Your rewrite must:

- Preserve all **function names**, **class names**, and their **structural organization** without any addition, removal, or renaming.
- Retain all input/output interfaces, method visibility (if present), and parameter lists intact.
- Maintain precise logical equivalence: no semantic changes, no added or removed features.

While doing so, maximize syntactic and structural divergence from the original pseudocode by extensively applying these transformations wherever possible without violating the above constraints:

1. **Variable and temporary identifier renaming:** Use completely different, yet context-appropriate, meaningful names.
2. **Control flow reworking:** Replace any loops with equivalent recursion or vice versa; refactor conditionals (e.g., if-else to guard clauses or switch-case); reorder independent statements; inline or extract helper computations within methods.
3. **Expression and operator refactorings:** Rewrite arithmetic and logical expressions using alternate but logically equivalent computations, including De Morganâ€™s laws, distributive properties, different operator order, or usage of equivalent functions.
4. **Data structure and traversal variation:** Change iteration techniques (e.g., index-based loops to foreach; while loops to for loops or recursion); alter data structure usages if semantically identical; reorder traversal sequences if semantics permit.
5. **Statement restructuring:** Reorder statements where dependencies allow; replace compound statements with simpler forms or expand simple statements into multiple steps.
6. **Whitespace and formatting:** Vary indentation styles, line splitting, spacing, inclusion of optional delimiters, and code grouping.
7. **Intermediate variable usage:** Introduce or remove intermediate helper variables, split or combine statements, and restructure computations inside functions.

**Strictly avoid any behavior-altering modifications:** no changes to algorithm logic, return values, side effects, or external interfaces. Do NOT change function signatures, class names, or their nesting.

Only output the rewritten pseudocode itself. Do not include any explanations, commentary, or extra text.
