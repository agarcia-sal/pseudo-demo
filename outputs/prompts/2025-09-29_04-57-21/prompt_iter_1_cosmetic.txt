Given the following pseudocode, generate a version that performs exactly the same functionality but is written as differently as possible. You must keep the same function names, class names, and class/object structures unchanged. Do not add or remove any functions or classes. Change the pseudocodeâ€™s style, structure, variable names (except function and class names), control flow, formatting, and expressions to maximize difference from the original.  

Output only the rewritten pseudocode without any additional explanation or text.
