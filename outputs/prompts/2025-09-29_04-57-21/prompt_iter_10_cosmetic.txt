Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a fully rewritten version that exactly preserves **all original functionality, output behavior, side effects, and API interfaces**, including:

- **Exact retention of all function names, class names, and their hierarchical structure (nesting and placement) without any changes.**

- **Preservation of all method signatures exactly:** parameter names, order, and method placement must remain unchanged.

Your rewritten pseudocode must be **maximally distinct** from the original in all other respects, demonstrating a completely independent implementation style that differs substantially in lexical, syntactic, and structural characteristics while remaining semantically equivalent. Specifically, your transformation must include:

1. **Rename every variable, parameter, and temporary identifier** to new, plausible but entirely different names.  
2. **Rewrite control flow extensively, employing alternative but equivalent constructs**, such as:  
   - Replace all `for` loops with `while` loops, recursion, or functional iteration variants.  
   - Convert nested `if`-`else` blocks into guard clauses, inverted conditions (using De Morgan’s laws), early returns, switch/case-style logic, or other semantically equivalent control forms.  
   - Unroll, regroup, or restructure loops and conditionals where logically permissible.  
3. **Rearrange, combine, or split independent computations and statements**, preserving exact evaluation order and results.  
4. **Rewrite expressions to logically equivalent variants**, utilizing:  
   - Different arithmetic formulations (e.g., `a - b` → `- (b - a)`), Boolean identities, operand reorderings, negations, and equivalent operators.  
5. **Change iteration and data traversal methods** where applicable, such as:  
   - Replace index-based collection access with element-wise iteration or iterators.  
   - Substitute iterative approaches with recursion or queue/stack usage, if suitable.  
6. **Reformat all pseudocode stylistic elements**: alter indentation styles, line breaks, spacing, statement grouping, and comment formatting or positioning if comments exist.  
7. **Avoid any functional, structural, or API-altering changes**: maintain all return points, output formats, and side effects exactly as in the original.  

**Your output must contain only the rewritten pseudocode snippet with no explanations, annotations, or commentary.**

---

**Strict conditions summary:**  
- Keep **all function names, class names, and class/object nesting exactly as in the input**.  
- Preserve **all method signatures with parameter names and order unchanged**.  
- Maintain **all return statements and output structures without alteration**.  
- Produce a rewritten implementation that appears entirely novel, minimizing all forms of lexical, syntactic, and structural similarity with the input.  

This prompt is designed to generate pseudocode that is functionally identical but syntactically, lexically, and structurally very different, reflecting an independently authored version.
