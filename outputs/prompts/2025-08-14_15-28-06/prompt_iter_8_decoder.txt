Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code using only standard libraries or well-known Python packages. Your implementation must:

- Read input exactly as implied by the pseudocode, using `input()` without prompts.
- Produce output exactly as specified, without extra prints or explanations.
- Handle all edge cases and be optimized for performance to run within 5 seconds.
- Use meaningful variable names derived from the pseudocode but keep your code concise.
- Avoid unnecessary comments, but include minimal comments if they clarify complex logic.
- Include all code inside a single Python code block like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```

No additional text outside the code block.  
Use idiomatic Python and leverage built-in functions and libraries wherever it improves clarity or performance.
