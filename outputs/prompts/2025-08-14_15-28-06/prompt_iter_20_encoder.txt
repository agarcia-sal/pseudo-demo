Generate clear, concise pseudocode directly from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language with standard symbolic operators (←, =, mod, etc.) and brief, consistent control structures: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `function`, `read`, `print`, `let`, `set`, `return`. Output only a numbered list of steps starting at 1, favoring mostly one-line statements and minimal indenting strictly for nested control flow clarity. Prefer compact, descriptive variable and function names reflecting the problem context. Use symbolic assignment (←) and natural expressions such as “read integer n”, “for i = 0 to n-1”, “if x mod 2 = 0”, “print result”. Avoid explanations, comments, empty lines, or decorative formatting. Format output exactly as:

1. statement  
2. next statement  
3. etc.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i = 0 to n-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j = i+1 to n-1  
  if A[min_i] > A[j] then set min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
