Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code enclosed in a single Python code block. Your solution must:

- Use only standard libraries or widely used Python packages without imports unless explicitly needed by the pseudocode.
- Read input exactly as implied by the pseudocode, using plain `input()` calls without prompts or extra text.
- Output exactly as specified by the pseudocode, with no additional prints, debug info, or explanations.
- Handle all edge cases and optimize for clarity and performance to run efficiently within 5 seconds.
- Use clear and meaningful variable names influenced by the pseudocode; prioritize concise, idiomatic Python.
- Prefer built-in functions, comprehensions, and Pythonic constructs for brevity and speed.
- Add minimal comments only when the logic is non-trivial or subtle, avoiding redundant comments.
- Place all code inside one Python code block like this:

```python
# translated code here
```

No text or explanation should appear outside the code block. Do not include separator lines or extra framing.

Produce code solutions that faithfully implement the pseudocode logic precisely and optimally within these constraints.
