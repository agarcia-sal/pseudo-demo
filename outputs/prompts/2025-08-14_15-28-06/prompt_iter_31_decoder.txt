Translate the given pseudocode into a single, efficient, and readable Python 3 solution enclosed strictly within one fenced Python code block as shown below:

```python
# your implementation here
```

Your solution must:

- Use only `input()` without arguments for all input operations.
- Produce output that exactly matches the pseudocodeâ€™s expected output format; do not print extra whitespace, line breaks, or debugging information.
- Name variables clearly and intuitively, reflecting their roles as implied by the pseudocode.
- Handle all edge cases that the pseudocode suggests or that could arise realistically from input specifications.
- Optimize runtime and memory: apply efficient algorithms, data structures, and standard Python libraries as needed (e.g., `sys.stdin.readline` for fast input, `collections`, `heapq`, `itertools`, `math`, etc.).
- Import standard libraries only when they meaningfully improve performance, clarity, or correctness.
- Minimize code redundancy and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Add minimal inline comments only for non-obvious or complex logic.
- Avoid any code or text outside the prescribed single Python code block.

**Do not output anything other than the single fenced Python code block containing your complete and final solution.**
