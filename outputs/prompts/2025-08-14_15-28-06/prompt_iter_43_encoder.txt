Generate concise, readable pseudocode directly from the given problem description using mostly natural language combined with standard, minimal symbolic notation (←, =, mod, etc.). Use brief, consistent control structures: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `function`, `read`, `print`, `let`, `set`, `return`. Favor mostly one-line instructions with minimal indenting only to clarify nested control flow. Prefer compact, descriptive names that reflect problem context. Express statements simply and clearly, e.g.:

1. let n be integer  
2. read n  
3. let A be vector of integers sized n  
4. read n elements into A  
5. for all i in A  
  set min_i ← i  
  for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i ← j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
6. print all elements of A

Output only the numbered list of steps starting at 1, with no explanations, comments, empty lines, or separators. Use symbolic assignment and natural expressions, e.g., “read integer n”, “for i = 0 to n-1”, “if x mod 2 = 0”, “print result”. Do not summarize, explain, or add anything beyond the numbered pseudocode steps.
