Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language combined with standard symbolic operators (←, =, mod, etc.) and brief control structures (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `function`, `read`, `print`, `let`, `set`, `return`). Favor compact one-liners and minimal indentation only to clarify nested blocks. Use short, descriptive variable and function names relevant to the context. Prefer natural expressions like “read integer n”, “for i = 0 to n-1”, “if x mod 2 = 0”, “print result”. Avoid explanations, comments, empty lines, and decorative formatting. Output only a numbered list starting from 1, exactly as:

1. statement  
2. next statement  
3. etc.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i = 0 to n-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j = i+1 to n-1  
  if A[min_i] > A[j] then set min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
