Translate the following pseudocode into idiomatic, clean, and optimized Python 3 code that strictly adheres to the input/output specifications implied by the pseudocode:

- Use only `input()` for reading inputs with no prompt strings.
- Output exactly as required by the pseudocode; produce no extraneous prints, comments, or explanations.
- Fully handle potential edge cases and ensure the code runs efficiently within a 5-second time limit.
- Write code that is concise but readable, with meaningful variable names directly inspired by the pseudocode.
- Use Pythonâ€™s built-in functions and standard libraries (including well-known packages like `collections`, `math`, `itertools`, `re`, etc.) whenever they improve correctness, clarity, or performance.
- Avoid unnecessary comments; add only brief clarifications when the logic is nontrivial.
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python fenced code block exactly as shown below:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Do not include any text outside this code block.  
Your solution should reflect best Python practices, prioritizing correctness and optimal performance.
