Generate concise, clear pseudocode directly from the given problem description, focusing on readability and compactness. Use mostly natural language enhanced with standard symbolic operators (←, =, mod, etc.) and concise, consistent control structures: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `function`, `read`, `print`, `let`, `set`, `return`. Favor mostly one-line statements and minimal but clear indentation strictly for nested blocks. Use descriptive but brief variable and function names reflecting problem context. Use symbolic assignment (←) and natural expressions like “read integer n”, “for i = 0 to n-1”, “if x mod 2 = 0”, “print result”. Avoid explanations, comments, empty lines, or decorative formatting. Output only a numbered list starting at 1, exactly as:

1. statement  
2. next statement  
3. etc.

Example output style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i = 0 to n-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j = i+1 to n-1  
  set min_i ← j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
