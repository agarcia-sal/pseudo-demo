Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that is clear and easy to read, using mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation (←, =, mod, div, etc.). Write statements as compact one-liners or very brief control structures using consistent keywords: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `function`, `let`, `set`, `read`, `print`, `return`. Use meaningful yet brief variable and function names aligned to the problem context. Avoid comments, explanations, empty lines, or decorative formatting. Output strictly as a numbered list starting at 1, each step a complete statement or a control line with indentation only for nested blocks. Favor natural, fluent phrasing and symbolic shortcuts like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if a mod 2 = 0 then print a else print "odd"

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i = 0 to size of A exclusive  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  if A[min_i] > A[j] then set min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
