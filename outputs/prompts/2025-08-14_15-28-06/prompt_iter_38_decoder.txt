```python
# Translate the given pseudocode into a single, well-structured Python 3 program.
# Your entire solution must be enclosed in one fenced Python code block as below.
# Adhere strictly to these requirements:
# - Use `input()` without arguments for all input reading.
# - Output only what's explicitly required by the pseudocode; no extra spaces, blank lines, or debugging prints.
# - Choose clear, descriptive variable names that reflect their purpose from the pseudocode.
# - Ensure correctness by handling edge cases and all input constraints.
# - Optimize time and memory by using efficient algorithms, data structures, and if needed, standard Python libraries.
# - Use advanced I/O methods (e.g., `sys.stdin.readline`) only if they offer clear performance gains for large inputs.
# - Import only standard Python modules necessary for clarity, performance, or correctness.
# - Write clean, concise, and maintainable code with brief comments only where logic is nontrivial.
# - Avoid redundant or superfluous computations.
# - The code must be executable as-is and solve the problem efficiently.
#
# Begin implementation immediately below inside a fenced Python code block:
