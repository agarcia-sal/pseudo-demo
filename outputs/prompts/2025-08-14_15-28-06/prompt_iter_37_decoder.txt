```python
# Convert the provided pseudocode into a single, fully self-contained, and efficient Python 3 program.
# Strictly enclose your entire solution within one fenced Python code block as shown below.
# Your code must:
# - Use only `input()` without arguments to read all inputs.
# - Produce output exactly as implied, with no extraneous characters, blank lines, or debug prints.
# - Use descriptive variable names that clearly represent their role in the pseudocode.
# - Handle all edge cases and input constraints implicitly or explicitly.
# - Optimize for both time and memory: select the best algorithms, data structures, and standard libraries.
# - Apply efficient I/O methods (like `sys.stdin.readline`) only if it substantially improves performance.
# - Import only standard Python libraries strictly necessary for correctness, performance, or clarity.
# - Write concise, clean, readable, and maintainable code with minimal comments solely for complex logic.
# - Avoid redundancy and unnecessary computations.
# - Prepare the solution to run directly as-is and solve the problem correctly and efficiently.
#
# Start your implementation below and enclose it in one fenced code block:

```python
