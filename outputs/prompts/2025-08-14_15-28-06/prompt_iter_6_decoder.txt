Translate the given pseudocode into robust, efficient, and concise Python code that executes within a 5-second timeout. Write your entire solution inside one Python code block, like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Your code should:

- Use standard `input()` calls without prompts to read all inputs.
- Avoid unnecessary comments and outputs beyond what the pseudocode specifies.
- Prioritize correctness, readability, and performance, utilizing Python's built-in functions and standard libraries as needed.
- Include any needed imports at the top of the code block.
- Optimize for speed and memory, ensuring the code can handle large inputs efficiently.
- Avoid placeholder code or explanatory textâ€”provide only the runnable Python solution reflecting the pseudocode logic.
