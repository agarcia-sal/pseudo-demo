Translate the given pseudocode into a single, clean, and optimized Python 3 program enclosed in a Python code block as shown below. Your translation must:

- Use only `input()` without arguments for all input reading.
- Match the input/output behavior exactly as implied by the pseudocode.
- Avoid printing or outputting anything other than what is required â€” no extra spaces, blank lines, comments, debugging info, or explanations outside the code block.
- Use meaningful, descriptive variable names that naturally follow from the pseudocode names.
- Implement efficient algorithms and data structures to ensure correctness and performance within a 5-second runtime limit.
- Handle all edge cases robustly.
- Leverage any Python standard library modules or built-ins where they improve clarity, readability, and/or execution speed (e.g., `sys`, `collections`, `heapq`, `math`, `itertools`, `re`).
- Minimize unnecessary complexity; include brief inline comments only if critical to understanding subtle or non-obvious logic.
- Encapsulate everything in a single fenced Python code block exactly like this:

```python
# your complete Python 3 solution here
```

**No additional text or code should occur before, after, or outside this code block.**
