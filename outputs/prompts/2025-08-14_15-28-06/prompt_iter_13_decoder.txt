Translate the given pseudocode into robust, fully functional, and idiomatic Python code enclosed strictly in a single Python code block as below:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Adhere to these requirements:

- Use only `input()` without prompt strings to read input exactly as implied by the pseudocode.
- Output only what is explicitly specified, with no extra debugging prints, explanations, or blank lines.
- Choose meaningful variable names inspired by the pseudocode but keep the code concise and readable.
- Handle all edge cases correctly and write code optimized for execution within 5 seconds.
- Use standard Python libraries and well-known packages if they improve clarity or performance.
- Prefer built-in functions, list comprehensions, generators, and efficient data structures.
- Avoid unnecessary comments; include minimal comments only when clarifying non-trivial logic.
- Do not include any extra text or separators outside the single Python code block.

Your translation must produce reliable, clean, and efficient Python code perfectly faithful to the pseudocodeâ€™s logic and input/output behavior.
