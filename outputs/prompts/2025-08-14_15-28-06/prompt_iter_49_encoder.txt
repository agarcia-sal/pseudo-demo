Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language mixed with standard symbolic operators (←, =, mod, /, etc.) and brief control flow keywords: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `function`, `read`, `print`, `let`, `set`, `return`. Express statements mostly in one line; indent only to clearly show nested control flow. Use descriptive yet compact variable and function names related to the problem. Prefer simple symbolic assignments and natural phrases like “read integer n”, “for i = 0 to n-1”, “if x mod 2 = 0”, “print result”. Avoid comments, explanations, blank lines, decorative formatting, or summaries. Output a numbered list starting at 1, formatted exactly as:

1. statement  
2. next statement  
3. etc.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
