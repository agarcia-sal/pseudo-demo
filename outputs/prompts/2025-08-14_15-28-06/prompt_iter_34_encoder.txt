Generate concise, clear pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language with standard symbolic operators (←, =, mod, etc.) and minimal, consistent control keywords: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `function`, `read`, `print`, `let`, `set`, `return`. Express steps compactly, favoring one-liners; indent only to show nested control flow clearly. Choose short but meaningful variable and function names tied to the problem context. Use symbolic assignments and natural phrasing like “read integer n”, “for i = 0 to n-1”, “if x mod 2 = 0”, “print result”. Output a numbered list starting at 1, without extra spaces or empty lines, and without explanation or commentary. Format exactly as:

1. statement  
2. next statement  
3. etc.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i = 0 to n-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j = i+1 to n-1  
  if A[min_i] > A[j] then set min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
