```python
# Translate the given pseudocode into a single, self-contained, and fully optimized Python 3 implementation.
# Your solution must be enclosed strictly within one fenced Python code block as shown below.
# It should read all inputs exclusively using input() with no arguments and produce output with exact formatting as implied.
#
# Requirements to maximize correctness and performance:
# - Use clear, descriptive variable names reflective of their pseudocode meaning.
# - Implement all implied edge-case handling.
# - Employ efficient algorithms, data structures, and builtin or standard library modules where performance or clarity benefits.
# - Optimize input/output for speed (e.g., use sys.stdin.readline if beneficial), but only if it meaningfully improves performance.
# - Import only standard Python libraries that improve correctness, efficiency, or readability.
# - Write concise, readable, and maintainable code; avoid redundancy.
# - Include minimal inline comments strictly for non-trivial logic.
# - Avoid printing debug info, extra whitespace, or extraneous text.
# - Provide the entire solution solely within the single fenced python code block with no other text or explanation.
# - Your code should be ready to run as-is and solve the translated problem correctly and efficiently.
