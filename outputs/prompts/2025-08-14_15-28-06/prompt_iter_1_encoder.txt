Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations to keep the pseudocode compact and high-level. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, or notes—only provide the step-by-step pseudocode. Prefer one-liners where possible. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode is clear and understandable. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to produce the best result within this limit.
