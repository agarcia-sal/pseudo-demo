Generate concise, compact pseudocode from the problem description that is clear and easy to read.  
Use mostly natural language combined with standard symbolic operators and succinct control structures (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `function`, `read`, `print`, `let`, `set`, `return`).  
Favor one-line statements; nest only to clarify control flow. Use consistent, descriptive variable and function names reflecting problem context, but abbreviate where it keeps pseudocode compact.  
Use symbolic assignment (←) and natural expressions such as “read integer n”, “for i = 0 to n-1”, “if x mod 2 = 0”, “print result”.  
Do not include explanations, comments, empty lines, extra formatting, or separators. Output precisely as a numbered list starting at 1 with this format:

1. statement  
2. next statement  
3. etc.

Example style:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
