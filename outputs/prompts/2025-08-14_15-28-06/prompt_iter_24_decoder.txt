Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, idiomatic Python 3 code that exactly reproduces the input/output demonstrated by the pseudocode. Your translation must:

- Use only `input()` with no argument strings for all inputs.
- Produce the specified output exactly, with no extra prints, comments, debugging info, or explanations outside the code block.
- Use clear, meaningful variable names derived from the pseudocode to maximize code readability.
- Write concise, efficient code that handles all edge cases correctly and performs well under typical competitive programming constraints within a 5-second runtime limit.
- Leverage Python standard libraries and built-in modules (e.g., `collections`, `heapq`, `itertools`, `math`, `re`, `sys`, etc.) judiciously to enhance clarity and speed.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity; add minimal inline comments *only if* absolutely necessary to clarify nontrivial logic.
- Encapsulate the entire solution in a single Python fenced code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

**No text, explanation, or code outside this block should be included.**
