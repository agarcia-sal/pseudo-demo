Translate the given pseudocode into clean, correct, and efficient Python code that runs within a 5-second timeout. Your code should:

- Take input exactly as `input()` or `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\n')` without prompts or extra text.
- Use any necessary standard or widely available Python libraries to maximize efficiency and clarity.
- Produce the output exactly as specified, without extra prints or debugging information.
- Avoid unnecessary comments; include brief clarifications only if it improves readability.
- Enclose all your code within a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# your complete translated code here
```

Write idiomatic Python code that optimally implements the logic given in the pseudocode, and ensure it handles edge cases robustly.
