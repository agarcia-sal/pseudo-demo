Generate clear, concise, and compact pseudocode from the given problem description.  
Use a mix of natural language, symbolic operators, and common abbreviations to keep the code high-level and easy to read.  
Produce only the step-by-step pseudocode—omit any purpose statements, summaries, explanations, notes, or comments.  
Prefer expressing statements in one line when practical, without sacrificing clarity.  
Use consistent, minimal formatting with numbered lines like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Emphasize clarity with simple control flow and variable assignments. Use natural language phrases for common operations (e.g., “read input”, “print result”, “for each element”), but combine with symbols (←, =, mod, etc.) to keep it compact.  
Do not include separator lines or decorative elements.  
Aim for the most effective pseudocode within a 5-second runtime limit.
