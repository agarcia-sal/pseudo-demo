Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and fully functional Python code without altering any class names, function names, or their signatures and class/object structures exactly as specified. Your code must:

- Preserve all original naming and structural details precisely.
- Correctly handle all data representations implied by the pseudocode, such as converting input lists representing trees, linked lists, or other data structures into appropriate Python objects using helper functions if needed.
- Use standard Python conventions (e.g., `None` instead of `null`).
- Include all necessary imports, helper functions, and handle edge cases and boundary conditions to avoid runtime errors.
- Be optimized and efficient, adhering to a 5-second runtime limit.
- Use standard libraries or popular third-party Python libraries where they can improve correctness, readability, or performance.
- Include only comments that clarify non-trivial or complex logic; do not add extraneous explanations or unrelated commentary.
- Output the entire solution as a single Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# translated code here
```

No additional text or explanationâ€”only the code block with your complete, test-ready Python implementation.
