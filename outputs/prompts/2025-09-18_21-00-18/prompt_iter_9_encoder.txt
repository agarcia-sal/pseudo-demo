Given a code snippet containing classes, functions, and other code elements, produce a strictly structured, highly abstract pseudocode that:

- Preserves exactly all original class names, function names, parameter names, and the hierarchical class/object nesting.
- Uses consistent indentation reflecting code blocks identically to the source.
- Expresses logic and control flow precisely as in the original, including all conditions, loops, and returns.
- Uses only conventional pseudocode keywords such as CLASS, FUNCTION, IF, ELSE, FOR, WHILE, RETURN, and END FUNCTION / END CLASS.
- Represents operations at a semantic level using natural language phrasing and avoids any programming language specific syntax, symbols, or operators.
- Maps all arithmetic and logical operators into clear natural language equivalents: e.g., PLUS, MINUS, MULTIPLIED BY, DIVIDED BY, MODULO, EQUALS, NOT EQUALS, LESS THAN, GREATER THAN, AND, OR, NOT.
- Represents data manipulation with uniform abstract verbs and phrases, e.g.: SET variable TO value, INCREMENT variable BY amount, APPEND item TO list, REMOVE first/last element FROM list.
- Explicitly defines constructors and special methods using their exact original names.
- Converts complex data structure initializations or helper routines outside or inside classes into auxiliary FUNCTIONs with original names, describing only essential abstract steps without concrete implementation or data structure syntax.
- Omits all comments, explanatory notes, example explanations, and additional textâ€”output ONLY the pseudocode.
- Avoids low-level programming details, language-specific idioms, literal syntax, or any variable type annotations.
- Uses descriptive, concise terms consistently to maximize clarity and naturalness without sacrificing abstraction.
- Includes all parameters in function signatures exactly as named, excluding any type hints or language-specific constructs.
- For loops and conditionals, clearly reflect iteration over collections or ranges using natural language constructs like "FOR each element IN collection" or "FOR index FROM start TO end".
- Presents all conditionals and expressions in fully spelled-out, readable form without symbolic shortcuts.

Example style for functions:

FUNCTION example_function(parameter_list)  
    SET variable TO initial_value  
    FOR each element IN parameter_list  
        IF element GREATER THAN threshold THEN  
            INCREMENT variable BY element  
        ELSE  
            SET variable TO variable MINUS element  
        END IF  
    END FOR  
    RETURN variable  
END FUNCTION

Example style for classes:

CLASS ClassName  
    FUNCTION __init__(self, param1, param2)  
        SET self.param1 TO param1  
        SET self.param2 TO param2  
    END FUNCTION  

    FUNCTION method_name(self, param)  
        [method body at this level of abstraction]  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
