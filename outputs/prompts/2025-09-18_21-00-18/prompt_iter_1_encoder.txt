Given a problem description, generate concise, high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand, using natural language, one-liners, symbolic forms, and abbreviations. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanationsâ€”only the pseudocode itself. Aim for compactness and clarity without sacrificing readability.
