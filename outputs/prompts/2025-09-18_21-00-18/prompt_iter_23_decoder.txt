Translate the provided pseudocode into fully functional, idiomatic Python code with the following requirements:

- Preserve all original class names, function names, signatures, and class/object structures exactly as given in the pseudocode.
- Implement all logic faithfully and completely, including handling edge cases and input conversions as implied by the pseudocode.
- For inputs described as lists representing linked lists, trees, or other complex data structures, provide robust and correct helper functions within your code to convert them properly into Python data structures with correct typing and references.
- Use `None` instead of `null` and follow standard Python input/output conventions.
- Use appropriate standard Python libraries or modules to improve correctness, clarity, and efficiency; import them explicitly where needed.
- Ensure your code runs without runtime errors and meets the expected output behavior.
- Add only minimal, clear comments to explain non-obvious or complex parts, avoiding excessive or redundant comments.
- Optimize for correctness and performance within a 5-second runtime constraint.
- Return only the code inside a single Python code block using triple backticks and `python`:

```python
# Your translated and fully functional code here
```

Do not include any additional explanations or text outside the code block.
