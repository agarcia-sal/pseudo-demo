Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understandable, using natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Prefer one-liners and compact constructs. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow a numbered step format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second execution constraint.
