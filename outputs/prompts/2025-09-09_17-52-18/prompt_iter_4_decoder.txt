Translate the provided pseudocode into fully correct, clean, and optimized Python code that preserves all class names, function names, and data structures exactly as given. Enclose the entire Python code within a single code block starting with ```python and ending with ```. Your implementation must:

- Strictly follow the logic and structure of the pseudocode.
- Correctly handle edge cases and input types (e.g., convert list inputs to linked lists if relevant).
- Ensure that all methods, classes, and variables retain their original names and scopes as in the pseudocode.
- Avoid adding any explanations, comments, or code outside the code block.
- Use Pythonâ€™s standard libraries and typing module where appropriate; external packages are allowed only if they improve correctness or performance within the 5-second timeout.
- Produce code that is clean, readable, and optimized for efficiency, considering both time and space constraints.
- Guarantee that the final code runs error-free on typical inputs and respects all input/output contracts implied by the pseudocode.
