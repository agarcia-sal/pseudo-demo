Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code that precisely implements the described logic. Preserve the exact function names specified in the pseudocode. Your code must be self-contained, use standard libraries or publicly available Python packages if needed, and be optimized for clarity and performance within a 5-second execution time.

Enclose the entire implementation strictly within a single Python code block formatted as follows:

```python
# translated Python code here
```

Do not include any explanations, comments outside the code block, or additional text. Prioritize correctness, readability, and idiomatic Python style while ensuring the solution matches the pseudocode semantics exactly.
