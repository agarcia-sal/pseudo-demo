Generate clear, concise, and natural pseudocode that is compact and high-level yet easy to read and understand.  
Keep all original function names exactly as in the problem description. Use meaningful variable names derived directly from original identifiers.  
Prefer symbolic notation (←, ∈, mod, | |), inline conditionals, one-liners, comprehensions, and chained statements whenever these improve brevity without losing clarity.  
Express control structures succinctly; use standard pseudocode idioms but favor natural language expressions that are precise and unambiguous.  
Number every line sequentially from 1 as follows:

`<step number>. <instruction>`

Examples of acceptable line formats:  
`1. x ← 0`  
`2. while x < n: x++`  
`3. for i ∈ 0 to |A|-1`  
`4. return sum(|x - mean| for x ∈ numbers) / |numbers|`  

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, notes, or separators. Do not restate or describe the problem. Output only the pseudocode according to these rules. Complete within 5 seconds.
