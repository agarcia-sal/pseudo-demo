Translate the provided pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and idiomatic Python code that exactly matches the logic and function names given. Your translation must be efficient and robust, optimized to execute within 5 seconds for typical inputs. *Do not* add any explanations, comments, or text outside the code block.

Strict requirements:
- Return only Python code enclosed in a single triple backtick-delimited code block marked with `python`.
- Preserve the exact function names and signatures from the pseudocode.
- Include all necessary imports explicitly.
- Use clear and readable Python constructs, prioritizing correctness and performance.
- Avoid any extraneous output, logging, or formatting beyond required code.

You may use any standard Python libraries or built-in functions that enable concise, performant implementations. Your goal is an accurate, concise translation that can pass stringent automated correctness and runtime tests.
