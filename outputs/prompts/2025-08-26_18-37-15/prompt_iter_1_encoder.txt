Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language, one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode steps. Follow this numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for compactness and clarity within a 5-second response time.
