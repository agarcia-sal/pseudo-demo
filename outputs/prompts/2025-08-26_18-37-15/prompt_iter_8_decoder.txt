Translate the given pseudocode into complete, clean, and idiomatic Python code that strictly preserves function names and signatures as specified. Your translation should be fully self-contained and runnable within 5 seconds, optimized for clarity, correctness, and efficiency. 

- Enclose all your code **only** within a single Python code block formatted as follows:

```python
# translated code here
```

- Use type annotations when type hints are given in the pseudocode.
- Import any standard Python libraries or packages if they improve clarity or efficiency.
- Fully implement all functions, including all necessary parts such as imports, helper functions, and return statements.
- Avoid any explanatory text, comments (unless clarifying complex logic is essential), or output outside the code block.
- Assume inputs and outputs follow canonical Python data structures unless otherwise specified.

Produce a polished, idiomatic Python implementation faithfully reflecting the input pseudocode.
