Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode using natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statement, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Use a compact, high-level style with mostly one-liners following this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Structure your pseudocode clearly and logically without extra notes. Keep variable names meaningful but concise. Remember, your solution should complete within 5 seconds.
