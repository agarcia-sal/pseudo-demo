Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, efficient, and Pythonic code, strictly preserving all class names, method names, function signatures, and their nesting structures exactly as specified in the pseudocode. Your implementation must robustly handle all edge cases, maintain logical correctness, and optimize for time and space performance to comfortably run within 5 seconds on typical input sizes. You may import and utilize any standard or third-party Python libraries deemed helpful for correctness or efficiency. 

Return only the complete, ready-to-run Python code enclosed in a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# your code here
```

Refrain from including any explanation, comments, or text outside this block. Use the exact function and class names as presented in the pseudocode with no renaming or reorganization.
