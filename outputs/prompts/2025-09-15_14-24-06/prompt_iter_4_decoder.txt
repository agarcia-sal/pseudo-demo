Translate the given pseudocode into fully functioning, well-structured, and efficient Python code that preserves the exact class and function names as in the pseudocode. Your implementation must remain inside the original class and method structure without altering their names. Enclose the complete code within a single Python code block using triple backticks and the language identifier (```python ... ```). Use meaningful variable names and optimize for readability, correctness, and performance to ensure your solution executes within 5 seconds on typical inputs. Handle typical edge cases as applicable. You may utilize any standard or third-party Python libraries if needed, but do not add any extra explanations or comments. Return only the code block without any additional text. Here is the pseudocode to translate:
