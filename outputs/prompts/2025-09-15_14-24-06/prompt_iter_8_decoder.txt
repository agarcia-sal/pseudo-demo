Translate the given pseudocode into correct, efficient, and well-structured Python code that strictly preserves all class names, function names, and their signatures exactly as provided. Your implementation must remain fully inside the original class and method structure without changing any names or hierarchy. Optimize the code for clarity, correctness, and performance to ensure execution within 5 seconds for typical inputs. Handle all standard edge cases appropriately. You may freely use any standard or third-party Python libraries to improve efficiency. Return only the complete code enclosed in a single Python code block with the language identifier (```python ... ```)â€”do not include any explanations, comments, or extra text outside this block. Here is the pseudocode to translate:
