Translate the provided pseudocode into precise, fully functional, and optimized Python code. Your implementation must strictly preserve all class and function names exactly as given in the pseudocode and maintain the original class and method structure without any renaming or restructuring. Write code that is clear, concise, and efficient enough to run within a 5-second limit on typical inputs, handling common edge cases appropriately. You may leverage any built-in or third-party Python libraries if they improve clarity or performance. Return only the complete code enclosed within a single Python code block fenced by triple backticks with the language identifier (`python`). Do not include any explanations, comments, or extraneous text before or after the code block. The pseudocode to translate follows:
