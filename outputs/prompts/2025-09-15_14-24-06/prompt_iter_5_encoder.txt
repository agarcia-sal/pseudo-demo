Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand by combining clear natural language with precise symbolic notation, while remaining compact and abstract.  
- Preserve all original class and function names exactly as given, and maintain the same class and object structure without modification.  
- Prefer short, expressive one-line statements wherever possible; use standard abbreviations and symbolic operators (e.g., ←, +=, [], {}, ∞) to represent assignments, arithmetic, indexing, and comparisons succinctly.  
- Write control flow using readable natural language keywords such as IF, ELSE, WHILE, FOR, RETURN, but avoid verbose phrasing or explanation.  
- Do not include any comments, notes, explanatory text, summaries, or separator lines; output only the numbered pseudocode steps.  
- Format instructions as numbered lines starting at 1, with nested blocks indented consistently under control statements, for example:  
  1. x ← 0  
  2. WHILE x < n: x++  
- End each function explicitly with RETURN if it produces output, and denote function boundaries clearly with FUNCTION <name>(parameters) / END FUNCTION.  
- Use natural language for control structures and simple descriptions, but use symbols and abbreviations for operations and data manipulation to keep the pseudocode concise yet unambiguous.  
- Ensure no deviation from original names or structure; do not invent additional variables or classes not in the problem description unless necessary for clarity.  
- Avoid verbosity by using compact expressions and avoid repetition or redundant wording.  
- Provide only the pseudocode as output and produce it efficiently within the 5-second runtime limit.  

Example pseudocode style for a function named calc_average:  

FUNCTION calc_average(list_of_numbers)  
  SET total_sum TO 0  
  FOR each number IN list_of_numbers  
    INCREMENT total_sum BY number  
  SET average_value TO total_sum DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF list_of_numbers  
  RETURN average_value  
END FUNCTION
