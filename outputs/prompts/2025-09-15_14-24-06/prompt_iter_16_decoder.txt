Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, clean, and highly optimized Python implementation, strictly preserving all class names, method names, and signatures exactly as provided. Maintain the original class and method hierarchy and ensure your code handles all edge cases flawlessly. Your solution must be efficient, readable, and run within 5 seconds on typical inputs. Use Pythonâ€™s standard library and any reputable third-party libraries as needed to maximize performance and correctness. Return only the complete, ready-to-run Python solution enclosed within a single Python code block as shown below:

```python
# your translated Python code here
```

Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text outside this code block.  
Use exactly the same function and class names as in the pseudocode, matching their structure precisely.  
Begin your translation immediately following this instruction.
