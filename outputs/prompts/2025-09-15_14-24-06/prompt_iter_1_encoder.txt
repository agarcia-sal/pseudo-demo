Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation, preferring one-liners and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this numbering format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure clarity and understandability without verbosity or extra details. Your function must complete within 5 seconds and produce the best possible result under this constraint.
