Translate the given pseudocode into highly accurate, efficient, and clean Python code, strictly preserving all class names, method names, function signatures, and their hierarchical structure exactly as specified in the pseudocode. Your implementation must:

- Use the same class and method names without any renaming, reordering, or restructuring.
- Handle all edge cases correctly and optimize for both time (<5 seconds) and space efficiency.
- Prefer idiomatic, Pythonic constructs and leverage any standard or third-party Python libraries that improve clarity or performance.
- Include all necessary imports within the code.
- Avoid adding any comments, explanations, or extra text outside the code.

Return only the full solution enclosed in a single Python code block using the syntax:

```python
# your code here
```
