Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functioning, efficient, and clean Python implementation that strictly retains all original class names, method names, signatures, and their hierarchical structure exactly as specified. Your solution must rigorously handle all described logic and edge cases, maintain maximal computational and memory efficiency, and complete within 5 seconds on typical inputs. If useful, you may freely import and employ any standard or third-party Python libraries to enhance correctness and performance. Output only the final code encapsulated in a single Python code block using the syntax:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Avoid including any explanations, comments, additional text, or extraneous output outside this code block. Ensure the naming and structure are identical to the pseudocode input. Here is the pseudocode to translate:
