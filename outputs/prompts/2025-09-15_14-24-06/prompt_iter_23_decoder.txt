Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python code, strictly preserving all class names, method names, function signatures, and their exact hierarchies as provided—no renaming or restructuring. Your solution must correctly address all possible edge cases and aim to run optimally within a 5-second execution window on typical inputs. You may import and utilize any standard or third-party Python libraries to maximize correctness, readability, and performance. Produce a single, finalized Python solution only, enclosed entirely within one Python code block as shown below. Do not include any comments, explanations, or text outside this code block. The function and class definitions must strictly mirror the pseudocode’s interface.
