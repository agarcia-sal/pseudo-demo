Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, efficient, and idiomatic Python code, strictly preserving every class name, method name, and method signature exactly as specified in the pseudocode, without altering the class or method hierarchy in any way. Your code should be optimized for clarity, correctness, and runtime performance within a 5-second execution limit on typical inputs. Ensure your implementation robustly handles all edge cases and uses appropriate Python features and libraries, including any standard or third-party packages that can enhance correctness or efficiency. Provide only the complete solution wrapped inside a single Python code block using this exact format:

```python
# your complete code here
```

Do not include any explanations, comments, or text outside the code block. The pseudocode to translate is as follows:
