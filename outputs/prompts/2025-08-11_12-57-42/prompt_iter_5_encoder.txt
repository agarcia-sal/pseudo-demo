Generate clear, concise, and compact pseudocode from the problem description, using natural-language style that is easy to read and understand. Focus solely on the core logic—do not include any purpose, summary, explanations, comments, or overview statements. Express operations in one-line statements wherever possible, using symbolic operators, standard abbreviations, and concise control structures. Use numbered lines starting at 1 like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use straightforward variable naming and indentation to show structure (e.g., loops or conditionals). Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Produce high-level pseudocode that captures essential steps efficiently without verbosity or redundancy. Output only the pseudocode following this format.
