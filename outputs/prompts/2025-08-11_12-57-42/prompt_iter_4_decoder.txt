Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and highly efficient Python code. Your code must meet the following requirements:

- Enclose all code within a single Python code block formatted as:
  ```python
  # your translated code here
  ```
- Use plain `input()` for all input operations without any prompt strings.
- Avoid any extraneous output like debug prints or separator lines.
- Prioritize correctness, readability, and runtime efficiency to ensure completion within 5 seconds for typical inputs.
- You may import and use any standard Python library or package if it improves clarity or performance.
- Include appropriate comments or docstrings only if they clarify non-trivial logic without cluttering code.

Focus on delivering the best possible, production-ready Python translation directly runnable as-is.
