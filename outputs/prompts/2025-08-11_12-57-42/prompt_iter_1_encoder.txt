Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Use easy-to-read, natural language with compact expressions, preferring one-liners, symbolic operators, and abbreviations. Avoid comments or extra explanations. Follow a numbered line format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Make the pseudocode clear and understandable, focusing on the core logic to fit within a 5-second generation limit.
