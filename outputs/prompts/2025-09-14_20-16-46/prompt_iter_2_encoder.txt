Write concise and clear pseudocode that closely follows the original problem’s class and function names and structure. The pseudocode should be high-level and easy to read, using natural language, symbolic operators, and abbreviations as appropriate but remaining compact. Keep it structured with minimal lines, preferably one-liners and succinct loops or conditions, adhering to this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or additional notes—only provide the pseudocode. Preserve all class and method names exactly as given. Use consistent indentation to show nesting but avoid any extraneous separators or formatting.

Example style to emulate:

If the original code is:
```python
def calc_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    avg = total / len(nums)
    return avg
```

Then the pseudocode should be:
```
FUNCTION calc_average(list_of_numbers)
    SET total_sum TO 0
    FOR each number IN list_of_numbers
        INCREMENT total_sum BY number
    SET average_value TO total_sum DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF list_of_numbers
    RETURN average_value
END FUNCTION
```

Focus on clarity, correctness, and maintaining the original program’s logic while producing compact, readable pseudocode in this consistent format.
