Write concise, high-level pseudocode based on the given problem description. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understandable, using natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Avoid providing any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Prefer one-liners and compact structures following this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode reflects the logic clearly and efficiently within the time constraints.
