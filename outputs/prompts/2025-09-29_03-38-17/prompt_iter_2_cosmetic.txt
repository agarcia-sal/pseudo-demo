Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally identical form that maximizes syntactic and stylistic difference from the original. Your rewrite should explore alternative control flow constructs, data structure representations, and expression styles (e.g., use comprehensions, recursion, different loop types, conditional expressions, or mathematical notation), while preserving the exact behavior and output of the original pseudocode. Maintain all original function names exactly as they are. Maintain all original class names, preserving their hierarchy, method signatures, and object structures without any changes. Avoid any additions, omissions, or renamings beyond these constraints. The output must contain only the rewritten pseudocodeâ€”no explanations, comments, or extra text.
