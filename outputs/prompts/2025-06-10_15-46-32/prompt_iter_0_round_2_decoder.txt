Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, efficient, and well-structured Python function or script, strictly adhering to the following requirements:

- Use only `input()` calls without any prompt strings to read inputs, assuming inputs come exactly as described by the pseudocode.
- Implement all logic needed so the code runs correctly and efficiently within 10 seconds on typical input sizes.
- Utilize any standard Python libraries or packages if they can improve clarity, simplicity, or efficiency.
- Produce clean, readable, and idiomatic Python code with appropriate variable names and minimal comments only if necessary for clarity.
- Do **not** include any extra text, explanation, or testing codeâ€”output only the Python code.
- Enclose the entire code snippet inside triple backticks specifying `python`, like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Strictly follow these instructions to maximize correctness, performance, and usability of the generated code.
