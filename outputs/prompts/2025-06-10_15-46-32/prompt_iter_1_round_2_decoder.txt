Translate the provided pseudocode into a complete, correct, and performant Python program or function that meets the following criteria:

- Use `input()` exactly as needed to read all inputs; do **not** include any prompt strings or extraneous input formatting.
- Implement all logic explicitly so the generated code runs correctly on all valid inputs within 10 seconds.
- Optimize for clarity, idiomatic style, and performance; use built-in Python features and standard libraries where appropriate.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their roles, ensuring clean, maintainable code.
- Avoid unnecessary comments; include minimal comments only if they significantly improve code understanding.
- Produce only the final Python codeâ€”no explanations, comments about the code, or testing scaffolds.
- Enclose **all** code within triple backticks with `python` for language highlighting, like so:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Strictly adhere to these instructions to maximize code correctness, efficiency, readability, and suitability for immediate use.
