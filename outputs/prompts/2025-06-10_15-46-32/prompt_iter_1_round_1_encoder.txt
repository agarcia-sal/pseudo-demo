Generate concise, compact pseudocode from the given problem description.  
Use a high-level style mixing natural language, symbolic assignments, and clear abbreviations. Prefer one-line statements whenever possible without sacrificing clarity.  
Number each line starting from 1 exactly as shown in the example, and indent nested blocks with one tab or 4 spaces.  
Do not include any explanations, comments, purpose statements, or summaries—only the pseudocode steps.  
Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Use meaningful variable names but keep expressions and control structures brief and direct.  

Follow this exact style and format precisely:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Here is an example pseudocode output your solution should emulate:  

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
