Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a high-level style with natural language, symbolic assignments, and compact one-liners where possible. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanatory notes—only pseudocode. Follow this format precisely, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode is understandable and logically ordered. Your function has a 10-second timeout; produce the best output within this limit.
