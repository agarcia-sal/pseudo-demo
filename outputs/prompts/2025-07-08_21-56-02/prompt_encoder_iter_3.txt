Write pseudocode to solve the given problem description. The pseudocode should be concise, easy to read, and high-level, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where possible. Format the pseudocode as numbered lines like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Prefer one-liners and compact constructs to clearly convey the logic within a 5-second execution constraint.
