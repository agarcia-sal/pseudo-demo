Generate clear, concise pseudocode from the given problem description, keeping all original function names exactly as in the source. Write in natural language mixed with compact, high-level programming expressions. Use symbolic assignments (←, +=, -=, etc.) and prefer one-liners when possible. Avoid all explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only pseudocode. Format control structures inline when simple (e.g., `while condition: action`), indent only when multiple steps are needed inside blocks. Always use consistent, intuitive abbreviations and minimal verbosity, but ensure readability and correctness. Do not include separator lines or any extraneous formatting.

Follow this precise format for numbered lines:

1. var ← value  
2. while condition: action

Example style to emulate:

in function exampleFunc  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers with size n  
for i from 0 to n-1: read A[i]  
set sum ← 0  
for x in A: sum += x  
print sum
