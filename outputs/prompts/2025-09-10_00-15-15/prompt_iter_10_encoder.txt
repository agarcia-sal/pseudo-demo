Generate concise, clear pseudocode from the given problem description, preserving all original function names exactly. Use natural language combined with compact, high-level programming expressions. Employ symbolic assignments (←, +=, -=, *=, etc.) and prefer concise one-liners where possible. Format control structures inline if simple (e.g., `while condition: action`); indent only when multiple steps are inside blocks. Use consistent, intuitive abbreviations but ensure readability and correctness. Avoid explanations, comments, notes, summaries, and separator lines—output only pseudocode. Follow this exact numbered line format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example style to emulate:

in function exampleFunc  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
