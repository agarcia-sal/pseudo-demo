Translate the given pseudocode into a fully working Python function or class exactly as specified, preserving all function names and signatures. Your translation must be complete and syntactically correct so it can be run and tested immediately without modification.  
- Enclose the entire Python code snippet within a single code block using triple backticks and specify `python` after the opening backticks, like this:  
```python  
# your code here  
```  
- Include necessary imports if your solution requires any standard Python libraries.  
- Implement all helper classes or functions referenced in the pseudocode (e.g., `ListNode`), even if not explicitly shown.  
- Do **not** wrap functions inside a class unless the pseudocode explicitly includes a class. Do **not** assume a class named `Solution`.  
- Complete every function fully; do not truncate code or leave incomplete statements.  
- Write clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that runs correctly within 5 seconds for typical inputs.  
- Do **not** include any explanations, comments, or text outside the code block.  
- Assume inputs to functions follow the pseudocode types and constraints exactly.  
Focus on correctness, completeness, and ensuring the returned code can be executed and tested immediately as-is.
