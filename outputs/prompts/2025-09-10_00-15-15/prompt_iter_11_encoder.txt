Generate concise, readable pseudocode directly from the given problem description, keeping all original function names intact. Use clear natural language mixed with compact, high-level programming syntax, symbolic assignments (←, +=, -=, etc.), and prefer one-line statements whenever possible. Format control structures inline if simple (e.g., `while condition: action`), indent only multi-step blocks. Use minimal but intuitive abbreviations without sacrificing readability or correctness. Do not include any explanations, purpose statements, comments, or extraneous formatting such as separator lines. Follow this exact numbered line format:

1. var ← value  
2. while condition: action

Example style to emulate:

in function exampleFunc  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A ← n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j from i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i ← j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
