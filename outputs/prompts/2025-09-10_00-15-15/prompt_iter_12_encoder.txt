Generate concise, readable pseudocode from the given problem description, preserving all original function names exactly. Write mostly in natural language with compact, high-level programming expressions; use symbolic assignments (←, +=, -=, etc.) and prefer one-liners whenever possible. Format control structures inline for single actions (e.g., `while condition: action`), indent only multi-step blocks. Use consistent, intuitive abbreviations without sacrificing clarity or correctness. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, notes, or separator lines—output only pseudocode.

Number every executable line starting at 1 with the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example to emulate:

in function exampleFunc  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j from i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  if A[min_i] > A[j]: min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
