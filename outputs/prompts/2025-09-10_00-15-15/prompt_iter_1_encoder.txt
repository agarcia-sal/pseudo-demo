Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, high-level constructs, and compact expressions with one-liners and symbolic assignments. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, overviews, notes, or comments—only provide the pseudocode itself. Follow the format:

1. var ← value  
2. while condition: action  

Ensure clarity and brevity, using abbreviations and symbolic notation where appropriate. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best possible result within this limit.
