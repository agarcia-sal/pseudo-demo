```python
You are given pseudocode defining one or more functions or classes. Translate the pseudocode into fully working, idiomatic Python code that preserves all original function and class names and signatures exactly as specified.  
- Produce only valid Python code, enclosed within a single markdown code block annotated with `python`, like this:
```python
# your code here
```  
- Include all necessary imports from the Python standard library or widely accepted external packages if needed.  
- Implement **all** helper classes or functions referenced or implied by the pseudocode, even if not shown explicitly (e.g., linked list node classes).  
- Do **not** introduce any wrapping class or container (such as a `Solution` class) unless explicitly present in the pseudocode.  
- Ensure every function and class is fully implemented, without truncation or placeholders.  
- Write clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code, suitable for immediate execution and testing without modification or additional boilerplate.  
- Assume input types and constraints exactly as described or implied by the pseudocode.  
- Do **not** output any explanation, comments, or text outside the single Python code block.  
- Responses must be self-contained â€” no external assumptions or dependencies beyond what you explicitly include.  
Focus on correctness, completeness, and readiness for immediate testing within a 5-second runtime limit.
