Given any input pseudocode, produce a fully rewritten version that meets these precise, stringent criteria:

1. **Semantic Equivalence:** The output pseudocode must be functionally identical to the input, preserving all outputs, side effects, state changes, and the exact logical flow and outcomes. No behavioral differences or deviations are allowed.

2. **Interface Integrity:** All externally visible elements—including class names, function or method names, their parameter and return types, parameter order and names, class inheritance, and declared object layouts—must remain completely unchanged, both in spelling and in relative location within class structures. Do not rename, reorder, or restructure any interface or API element.

3. **Comprehensive Internal Transformation:** For all internal implementation details (local variables, temporary identifiers, parameter names if not part of interface, control flow constructs, expression trees, literals, statements, helper routines, data traversal strategies, formatting, and any in-body code):

   - **Rename Transparently:** Substitute every local variable and non-interface parameter with new, semantically unrelated and unique identifiers, avoiding any reuse or hints from the original names.

   - **Control Flow Rescripting:** Replace all loop types with alternative logically equivalent forms (for ↔ while ↔ repeat-until ↔ recursion including tail-recursion transformations), ensuring behavior and iteration counts remain unchanged. Vary ordering of independent safe operations, sequence of traversals, and branching constructs without altering effects.

   - **Expression Deep Remodeling:** Transform all expressions extensively by applying identities (arithmetic, logical, Boolean algebra such as De Morgan’s laws), rewriting constants as equivalent expressions or named constants, expanding or collapsing compound assignments, and introducing or removing intermediate variables, subexpressions, or inline expansions.

   - **Block and Statement Restructuring:** Split, merge, reorder, or nest statements and conditionals safely to maximize structural divergence. Vary early returns, deferred returns, helper function boundaries, and inline expansions with perfect semantic preservation.

   - **Helper Routine Alterations:** Replace calls to built-in or standard library functions with local helper procedures implementing identical logic, or conversely, refactor custom helpers into built-in calls where applicable. You may inline, extract, or rename helper routines internally, provided their external signatures and behavior remain consistent.

   - **Traversal and Data Access Variation:** Change iteration directions, indexing styles, or methods of accessing data structures in ways that preserve side-effect order and final results.

   - **Maximize Formatting and Stylistic Variance:** Thoroughly alter indentation, line breaking, whitespace usage, block delimiters, keyword casing, comment/elimination (if any), statement ordering (where order is semantically neutral), and any other superficial stylistic aspects to ensure minimal superficial resemblance.

4. **No Algorithmic Change:** Do not omit, merge, optimize away, or abstract any algorithmic, logical, or data structural steps or components. The conceptual solution and all its parts must remain recognizably intact.

5. **Output Requirements:** Return only the fully rewritten pseudocode as a complete, standalone fragment. Do not include explanations, comments, metadata, or extraneous text. The output should be independent and maximally orthogonal in identifier choice, control flow, expression form, helper usage, and stylistic presentation.

6. **Universality:** This prompt applies indiscriminately to any pseudocode input, regardless of problem domain, complexity, or established style.

**Emphasize extreme, layered orthogonal rewriting across all internally mutable elements and constructs to achieve maximal syntactic and structural divergence while strictly preserving all externally visible interface elements and exact program semantics.**

Output only the transformed pseudocode.
