Given any input pseudocode, produce a completely rewritten variant that absolutely satisfies all these stringent requirements:

- **Exact semantic preservation:** The output pseudocode must replicate every aspect of the original behavior identically, producing the same outputs, side effects, and preserving all logical outcomes without any deviation.

- **Interface immutability:** Retain every class name, method/function name, signature (parameters and return types), declared class hierarchy, and object layout *exactly as in the input.* Do **not** rename, reorder, restructure, or abstract any interface element, external API, or program contract identifier.

- **Maximal, multidimensional internal transformation:** For all other code elements—local variables (including parameters local to function bodies if renameable), temporary variables, control structures, expressions, literals, helper functions, data traversals, and formatting—apply aggressive, comprehensive, and layered rewriting *to maximize minimal lexical and structural overlap*, including but not limited to the following transformations. Apply these transformations creatively and in combination wherever possible to exponentially increase divergence:

  1. **Control flow restructuring:**
     - Convert all loop types into logically equivalent alternatives (for ↔ while ↔ repeat-until ↔ recursive/tail-recursive implementations).  
     - Reshape conditionals by decomposing compound conditions, merging consecutive ones, employing De Morgan’s transformations, and altering nesting depths.  
     - Rearrange early returns and deferred return variable usage interchangeably.  
     - Inline helper calls or extract inline code into new helper procedures where equivalent, choosing alternately to inline or abstract.

  2. **Identifier obfuscation:**
     - Replace all local/temporary/parameter variables with freshly generated, semantically neutral, unrelated names *entirely disjoint* from the original local identifiers—no semantic hints or reuse.  
     - Maintain parameter variable renaming if it does not violate the method/function signature preservation requirement.

  3. **Expression overhaul:**
     - Rewrite every expression by applying arithmetic and logical identities, distribute and factor expressions differently, expand or contract compound assignments, and substitute equivalent expressions (e.g., `x * 2` ↔ `x + x`).  
     - Recast condition checks using De Morgan’s laws or equivalent Boolean formulations.  
     - Represent literals as equivalent arithmetic expressions or named constants if applicable.  
     - Introduce or remove intermediate temporary variables for calculations, balancing flattening versus nesting transformations.

  4. **Data traversal variability:**
     - Change the order or method of traversing data structures (iteration vs recursion, index order reversed, or alternate traversal schemes) where semantics and side effects are invariant.  
     - Reorder safe, independent operations if the result is unaffected.

  5. **Helper routine refactoring:**
     - Swap direct built-in or standard library calls with custom helper procedures implementing identical logic, or replace original custom helpers by corresponding built-in calls if available and functionally equivalent.  
     - Rename helper routines as needed, respecting the interface immutability constraints.

  6. **Full stylistic diversity:**
     - Vary all formatting details drastically: indentation styles and levels, line breaks, whitespace and blank line placements, block delimiters or their syntax, keyword casing (upper/lower/mixed), comment removal, and overall code ordering beyond interface dependencies.

- **No algorithmic alterations:** Do not remove, add, optimize away, or introduce any algorithmic steps, data structures, or conceptual components. The original logical flow and conceptual content must remain fully intact.

- **Strict output format:** Return only the transformed, complete pseudocode as a standalone piece of code, preserving required names and class structures exactly as they appear in the input. Omit all explanations, justifications, comments, annotations, or any other text.

- **Universal applicability:** This prompt applies to any pseudocode input regardless of programming domain or problem context.

Your objective is to maximize orthogonal differences in identifiers, control flow, expressions, data traversals, subroutine structures, constants, and formatting *simultaneously* while strictly preserving all program interfaces and exact semantics.

**Output only the fully rewritten pseudocode.**
