Given any input pseudocode, produce a fully reimagined pseudocode output that satisfies all of the following requirements:

1. **Preserve complete semantic equivalence:**  
   - The transformed pseudocode must implement exactly the same functionality, logic, side effects, inputs, and outputs as the original.  
   - No changes to algorithmic steps, data structures, or fundamental concepts are allowed.  

2. **Maintain all externally visible interface elements without alteration:**  
   - Preserve all class names, including their inheritance and nesting structure.  
   - Preserve all function and method names and their exact signatures (name, parameter count, parameter order, parameter names, and return types if any).  
   - Do not rename, reorder, or restructure these interface-defining elements in any way that affects how the code is invoked externally.  

3. **Maximally and orthogonally rewrite all internal implementation details, using diverse, multilayered transformations that include but are not limited to:**  
   - **Control flow:** convert loops into equivalent alternative forms (for ↔ while ↔ repeat-until ↔ recursion ↔ tail-recursion), invert or split conditionals, reorder independent statements where safe.  
   - **Variable renaming:** replace *every* local, temporary, and parameter variable identifier with unique, arbitrary, semantically valid names unrelated to originals and mutually distinct.  
   - **Expressions:** deeply rework all expressions using arithmetic identities, logical equivalences (including De Morgan’s laws), distribution/association, expanding or contracting assignments (e.g., += vs explicit sums), rewriting constants as expressions or predefined constants.  
   - **Data traversal:** alter iteration and access order where it does not affect program semantics, including traversing collections in alternate valid orders or via different indexing strategies.  
   - **Helper functions and procedures:** inline or extract subexpressions or helper methods; replace built-in or standard library calls with custom-implemented equivalents or vice versa; interchange local helper calls with standard idioms when functionally safe.  
   - **Control structure reshaping:** rearrange nesting depths, move returns earlier or later, refactor conditional cascades and loop bodies without losing equivalence.  
   - **Statement decomposition and merging:** split complex statements into simpler ones; combine sequential simple statements into compound ones where semantics allow.  
   - **Formatting and style:** vary all whitespace, indentation, line breaks, naming casing, block delimiters, and ordering of code elements stylistically to maximize surface syntactic difference.  

4. **Do not add, remove, or abstract away any computations, checks, or data handling involved in the original code.** The transformed code must be a faithful reimplementation, not an approximation or shortcut.  

5. **Output format and constraints:**  
   - The output must be a single, complete pseudocode code block expressing the entire rewritten program or class as a standalone entity.  
   - Do not include any explanations, comments, annotations, or extraneous text — only the transformed pseudocode.  
   - This prompt applies universally to any input pseudocode regardless of its problem domain or complexity.  

**Emphasize deep, layered, and orthogonal rewriting across all internal implementation aspects (variables, flow control, expressions, data access patterns, helpers, constants, formatting) while strictly preserving all class and function names, signatures, and external interfaces verbatim and ensuring exact functional equivalence.**

**Output only the transformed pseudocode.**
