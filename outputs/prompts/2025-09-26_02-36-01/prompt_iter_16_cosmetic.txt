Given any input pseudocode, produce a fully transformed version meeting these strict criteria:

1. **Semantic identity**: Your output must implement the exact same logic, produce identical results, and preserve all side effects and behaviors of the original pseudocode without exception.

2. **Preserve all interface identifiers and structures exactly**:
   - Keep all class names, function/method names, signatures (names, parameter names and types, order, return types)—unchanged.
   - Maintain original class hierarchies and containment relationships (which classes contain which functions or nested classes).
   - Do not rename, reorder, merge, or split classes or externally visible functions/interfaces.
   - Do not alter any external or API-facing identifiers or structures.

3. **Maximal, orthogonal rewriting of all non-interface internals**, including but not limited to:

   - **Variable identifiers:** Rename every local, temporary, and parameter variable with freshly generated, semantically unrelated names; use consistent renaming per scope to avoid collisions; do not preserve any substring or semantic clues of original names.

   - **Control flow constructs:** Re-express all loops using alternate equivalent forms (for ↔ while ↔ repeat-until ↔ recursion ↔ tail recursion), preserving loop semantics exactly; reorder independent statements safely; flatten or deepen nesting of conditionals and loops.

   - **Expressions:** Systematically rewrite all expressions using algebraic/logical identities, De Morgan’s laws, expand or contract compound assignments, introduce or remove intermediate variables, rewrite literals as computed expressions or constants, and replace direct operators with equivalent constructs.

   - **Data traversals:** Change iteration orders and traversal styles where results do not depend on order; merge or split traversal loops provided semantics remain intact.

   - **Helper routines:** Inline custom helpers into original code or extract inline code into new helper functions; replace standard library or built-in calls with equivalent explicit implementations or vice versa.

   - **Statements:** Decompose complex statements into simpler ones or combine sequences into compact forms wherever behavior is preserved.

   - **Formatting and syntax style:** Thoroughly alter formatting, including indentation levels, line breaks, whitespace, keyword casing, delimiter styles, and code block structures to minimize stylistic similarity.

4. **Strict omission**: 
   - Do not add or remove any algorithmic steps, data structure declarations, or conceptual components.
   - Do not optimize, simplify, or abstract away logic—every operation and sequence from original must appear in some logically equivalent form.
   - Do not rename, reorder, or refactor externally visible identifiers or interface elements.

5. **Output format:** 
   - Output only the transformed pseudocode as a complete, standalone program in a style clearly distinct from the input.
   - The output must remain a valid pseudocode snippet executable in the same conceptual manner but with minimal lexical, syntactic, or structural similarity aside from the fixed interface elements noted above.
   - Do not include explanations, comments, annotations, or any extraneous text—only the rewritten pseudocode.

6. **Universality:** This prompt applies exactly the same way regardless of the domain, problem, or specific input pseudocode.

Your goal is to maximize syntactic, lexical, structural, and stylistic divergence at all possible orthogonal axes—identifiers, control flow, expressions, helper usage, traversals, formatting—while preserving the full interface and guaranteed semantic equivalence of the given pseudocode.

Output solely the rewritten pseudocode text.
