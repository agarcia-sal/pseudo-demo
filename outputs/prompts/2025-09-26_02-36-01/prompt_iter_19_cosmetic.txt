Given a piece of pseudocode as input, generate a fully transformed version that meets all of the following stringent criteria without exception:

1. **Preserve Behavior Precisely:** The transformed pseudocode must implement exactly the same algorithmic logic and produce identical outputs and side effects in every scenario as the original. No simplifications, removals, or additions of algorithmic steps or data structures are allowed.

2. **Maintain All Public Interfaces and Structural Names:** Keep every class name, method/function name, signature (including parameters’ names, types, order, and return types if specified), class inheritance hierarchy, and declared object layout perfectly unchanged and in their original locations. Do not rename or reorganize these in any manner.

3. **Maximally Reimagine All Other Internal Code Elements and Structures:**  
   - Substitute **all local, temporary, and parameter variable names** with new, completely unrelated names that share no lexical or semantic resemblance to originals.  
   - **Rewrite control flow constructs** exhaustively, including:  
     - Converting between all forms of loops and recursion (for, while, repeat-until, tail recursion, direct recursion), while preserving iteration counts and order of side effects.  
     - Reordering or splitting/merging conditionals as long as logic remains equivalent.  
     - Altering early returns to deferred returns via variables or vice versa.  
     - Restructuring nested blocks, flattening or deepening nesting levels without changing logic.  
   - **Transform expressions deeply and systematically:**  
     - Apply arithmetic and logical identities (associativity, distributivity, De Morgan’s laws, double negation, etc.).  
     - Rewrite constants as equivalent expressions or named constants.  
     - Expand or contract compound assignments and operators.  
     - Introduce or eliminate intermediate variables or inline expressions.  
     - Substitute built-in or standard library calls with custom helper procedures implementing identical functionality, and likewise replace custom helpers by built-in calls where possible.  
   - **Reorder statements freely** where order independence or side-effect invariance is guaranteed, including safe swaps, merges, and splits.  
   - **Modify data traversal patterns:** change iteration direction, indexing schemes, or access orders as long as output and side effects remain consistent.  
   - **Vary all formatting aspects extensively:** indentation levels and styles, line breaks, whitespace distribution, block delimiters, casing of keywords, comment removal, and ordering of logically independent code blocks.

4. **Avoid Any Changes to External APIs, Contracts, or Interfaces:** Do not rename or restructure any code elements that appear as part of the program’s external contract or interface, including exposed API signatures, class inheritance relationships, or declared attributes.

5. **Produce Only the Fully Rewritten Pseudocode:** Output the transformed pseudocode alone, as a complete, valid, standalone block, without any explanations, annotations, comments, or meta-text.

6. **Apply the Above Universally:** Your transformation approach should be domain-agnostic and applicable to any pseudocode input regardless of problem context or complexity.

Strictly adhere to these instructions. Emphasize orthogonal, multi-level transformations across identifiers, control structures, expressions, data accesses, helper functions, and formatting to maximize divergence in code appearance and structure from the input, while perfectly preserving all class/method names and exact function signatures and retaining full semantic equivalence.

**Output only the transformed pseudocode.**
