Given any input pseudocode, produce a fully functionally equivalent pseudocode rewriting that strictly adheres to the following directives:

1. Preserve all class names, method/function names, signatures (names, parameter types, order, and return types), class inheritance hierarchies, declared object attributes, and all explicit external interfaces exactly as in the input. Do not rename, reorder, restructure, or alter any of these interface-defining elements.

2. For all internal implementation details—including but not limited to local variables, temporary variables, parameter identifiers (as references only, renaming allowed internally if distinct from signature parameters), control flow constructs, expressions, constants, data traversal orders, helper functions or subroutines, and formatting—apply maximal, multi-layered, deep transformation to achieve the greatest possible lexical, syntactic, and structural divergence from the original, while maintaining exact semantic equivalence. Such transformations must include (but are not limited to):

   • Systematic and global renaming of all internal/local/temporary variables and parameter internal aliases to fresh arbitrary unrelated tokens with no semantic hints or resemblance whatsoever.

   • Exhaustive replacement of all loop constructs with alternate logically equivalent control flows selected from for, while, repeat-until, recursion, and tail recursion, guaranteeing identical iteration behavior and side effect ordering.

   • Decomposition or aggregation of statements; splitting, merging, or flattening conditionals; reordering independent statements, provided no observable semantic or side-effect changes occur. This extends to data traversal order which can be altered whenever output or side effects remain invariant.

   • Profound rewrite of all expressions leveraging arithmetic, logical, and boolean identities (e.g., distribution, factoring, De Morgan’s laws), conversion between compound and simple assignments, substitution of equivalent expressions, introduction or removal of intermediate temps, recasting constant literals as expressions or defined constants, and reformulating all conditions comprehensively.

   • Reshaping control flows by extracting or inlining subexpressions or helper procedures, moving returns to early-exit or deferred variable patterns, and altering nested conditional and loop structures extensively without changing the overall logic.

   • Systematic replacement of direct built-in or standard library calls with equivalent custom local helper routines implementing identical behavior, as well as the inverse (inlining helper calls with built-ins), wherever and whenever functional equivalence can be guaranteed.

   • Complete restyling including but not limited to arbitrary changes in indentation patterns, line breaks, whitespace, grouping delimiters, capitalization or casing of keywords, reordering of code blocks when semantics permit, and varying all formatting nuances without affecting meaning.

3. Do not introduce, remove, optimize away, abstract, or otherwise alter any algorithmic steps, data structures, fundamental procedures, or conceptual components of the original code. Logic and algorithmic behavior must remain identical and complete.

4. The output must consist solely of the entirely rewritten pseudocode text, formatted as a fully standalone, syntactically correct, self-contained code snippet, exhibiting minimal lexical or structural resemblance to the original except for the explicitly preserved interface identifiers noted above.

5. This prompt applies universally to any given pseudocode input from any domain or problem context.

6. Your response must include no explanations, annotations, comments, or any supplementary text—only output exactly the transformed pseudocode text.

Emphasize exhaustively orthogonal rewriting of all implementation parts: identifiers, control structures, expressions, helper routines, constants, data traversals, and formatting, maximizing all forms of dissimilarity from the input, while scrupulously preserving all interface names and exact program semantics.

Output only the fully transformed pseudocode.
