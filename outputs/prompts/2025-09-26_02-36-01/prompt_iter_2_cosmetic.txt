Given an input pseudocode, produce a rewritten version of the pseudocode that meets all these criteria:

- Fully preserves the original functionality exactly.
- Maintains all original class names, function names, method signatures, and their class/object hierarchy without any change.
- Changes all other aspects as thoroughly as possible to maximize syntactic and structural difference:
  - Rewrite control flows with alternate constructs if possible (e.g., replace FOR loops with WHILE loops or vice versa, unfold or fold compound statements).
  - Use different but semantically equivalent variable names (avoid original variable names except for the required class and function names).
  - Reorder statements where order is not semantically significant.
  - Replace arithmetic, conditional expressions, and data structure accesses with alternative formulations or synonyms (e.g., spelled-out math operations, alternate indexing styles, logical inversions).
  - Use varied formatting, avoid replicating the original variable declaration style (e.g., use different assignment keywords, different ways to express increments or loops).
  - Express constants, literals, and data structures differently but equivalently.
  - Introduce helper intermediate variables or break down complex expressions into multiple steps differently.
- Avoid adding any explanation, comments, or output other than the newly rewritten pseudocode.
- Output only the rewritten pseudocode and nothing else.

This prompt must apply universally, to any pseudocode input, irrespective of problem domain or content. Your rewritten pseudocode must appear as an independently authored alternative version, maximizing difference while guaranteeing full semantic equivalence and preserving original class and function names precisely as in the input.
