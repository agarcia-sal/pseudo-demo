Given an input pseudocode, generate a complete, fully rewritten version adhering precisely to the following criteria:

- Preserve **exact functional and semantic equivalence**: the output pseudocode must match the original's behavior exactly, including outputs, side effects, state changes, and interaction contracts.

- Maintain **all external interface elements verbatim without alteration**: class names, function and method names, parameter lists (names, order, and types if specified), return types, class inheritance, and the explicit object-oriented structure must be retained without any change.

- Create **maximal syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence** from the original in every other aspect by exhaustively applying numerous orthogonal transformations throughout the codebase, including but not limited to:

  • **Permutation and form alteration of control flow**: systematically convert all loops to alternate equivalent constructs (e.g., for ⇄ while ⇄ repeat-until ⇄ recursion ⇄ tail recursion), and transform conditional statements by merging, splitting, nesting or flattening, rearranging guard clauses and else-if ladders, and refactoring return points (early vs late return).

  • **Total local and temporary identifier renaming**: rename every local variable, parameter (if not externally fixed by signature), and intermediate helper identifier to entirely new, unrelated names ensuring no lexical overlap or resemblance with any original local/temporary names. Preserve original external API identifiers exactly.

  • **Expression rewriting at all levels**: deeply rewrite arithmetic, logical, Boolean, and string operations using equivalent identities, logical equivalences (De Morgan, distribution, negation), expanded or contracted operator forms (e.g., replace compound assignments with their full expansions and vice versa), alternate numeric literal encodings via formulas or decompositions, and reorganize independent computation order safely.

  • **Algorithmic structure reorganization without changing logic**: split or merge loops and conditionals, inline or extract expressions and subcomputations, change traversal orders over data structures (forward ↔ backward) maintaining result equivalence, replace built-in or standard library calls with equivalent local helper functions or vice versa, and smartly introduce or eliminate intermediate temporaries to restructure expression dependencies and grouping.

  • **Consistent literal and constant substitution**: replace numeric constants with semantically equivalent expressions (e.g., sums, products, or bitwise operations), alternate Boolean literals as expressions if possible, or define explicit constants locally to replace literals.

  • **Formatting and stylistic overhaul**: radically vary indentation styles, line breaks, keyword casing, block delimiters, spacing, and comment removal so the output pseudocode appears independently authored and visually distinct.

- Prohibit adding, removing, or abstracting any algorithmic step, data structure, helper function, or conceptual element; no logical simplifications, optimizations, or semantic shortcuts are allowed. The functional and conceptual footprint must be maintained precisely.

- The transformation must be universal and domain-agnostic, guaranteeing applicability to any input pseudocode regardless of problem content.

- Output exactly and only the fully transformed pseudocode text—omit any description, annotations, explanations, comments, or auxiliary remarks.

- The emphasis is on a layered, multifaceted rewriting pipeline that yields maximal surface-level difference to the input, making the output pseudocode resemble an independently conceived and implemented version—preserving only the externally exposed interfaces intact and faithful.

Your output must strictly comply with these mandates, producing novel, syntactically remote but functionally identical pseudocode yielding minimal detectable lexical or structural overlap beyond preserved class and function signatures.
