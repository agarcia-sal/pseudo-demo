Given any input pseudocode, produce a fully rewritten variant that meets all these stringent criteria:

1. **Semantics must be perfectly preserved:** The output pseudocode must behave identically to the input in every way—input-output relations, side effects, order-dependent semantics, data mutations, and algorithmic results must be exactly the same.

2. **Keep all interface elements intact:** Retain all class names, method/function names, full signatures (names, parameter types, parameters order, and return types where specified), class inheritance structures, and declared data layouts exactly as in the input. Do not rename, reorder, or alter any identifiers or constructs that define the program’s external or internal API, class hierarchy, or data schema.

3. **Maximally transform all non-interface internal code elements with diversified, layered rewrites:**

   - **Control flow transformations:** Convert loops to semantically equivalent alternatives (for ↔ while ↔ repeat-until ↔ recursion including tail-recursion), alter branching by splitting or fusing conditionals, invert or reorder condition checks using logical equivalences (e.g., De Morgan’s laws), and restructure returns (early returns ↔ deferred returns via variables).

   - **Variable renaming:** Replace every local, temporary, and parameter variable with new, unrelated, non-cognate names that bear no resemblance to the original identifiers, avoiding semantic hints. Ensure uniqueness and no shadowing conflicts.

   - **Statement manipulation:** Break down complex statements into multiple simpler ones or combine sequential statements where safe; reorder independent, side-effect-free operations; alter data traversal orders and iteration styles whenever the output or side effects remain unaffected.

   - **Expression rewriting:** Apply extensive algebraic/logical rewrites such as distributing, factoring, and expanding expressions; replace constants by computations or named constants; convert compound assignments to explicit incremental statements and vice versa; inline or extract subexpressions; rewrite all conditionals and logical expressions with equivalent forms.

   - **Helper procedures and standard calls:** Inline helper functions into their callers or, conversely, extract repeated logic into new helper procedures; substitute calls to built-in or standard library functions with local reimplementations exhibiting identical behavior, or replace custom helper calls with their standard analogs as feasible.

   - **Formatting and stylistic overhaul:** Thoroughly vary whitespace, indentation, line breaks, letter casing of keywords, delimiters, comment styles (if any), blank lines, and statement ordering where no semantic disruption occurs. Choose distinct code structuring and stylistic conventions compared to input.

4. **Preserve full algorithmic logic without addition, removal, or simplifications:** Do not optimize away, introduce, or omit any logical step, algorithmic component, data structure usage, or conceptual entity that appears in the original pseudocode. The reimplementation must explicitly manifest all original computational steps.

5. **Maintain all external API and contract identifiers unchanged:** Do not rename or restructure identifiers that define public-facing or cross-module APIs, exposed interfaces, class hierarchies, method/function signatures, or declared data structures.

6. **Universal applicability:** The prompt must yield high-quality rewritten pseudocode regardless of domain, problem complexity, or coding style of the input.

7. **Output instructions:** Output solely the transformed complete pseudocode as a standalone code snippet, free of any explanations, commentary, annotations, metadata, or additional text.

**Emphasize aggressive, systematic, multi-dimensional rewriting across identifiers, control flows, data traversals, expressions, helper abstractions, constants, and formatting to maximize lexical and structural divergence, respecting the above constraints and perfectly preserving all interface and semantic properties.**

Strictly output only the transformed pseudocode.
