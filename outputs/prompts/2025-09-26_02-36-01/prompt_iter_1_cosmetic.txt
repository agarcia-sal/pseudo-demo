Given the original pseudocode, rewrite it to produce a version that accomplishes exactly the same functionality but is as different as possible in structure, style, and expression. Preserve all original function names, class names, and their respective class and object hierarchies without any changes. The output should contain only the rewritten pseudocode and nothing else.
