Given any input pseudocode, generate a fully transformed version that meets the following comprehensive criteria to maximize surface syntactic divergence while strictly preserving all original functionality:

- **Exact semantic equivalence:** The output pseudocode must reproduce precisely the same logic, outputs, side effects, and algorithmic behavior as the input. No simplifications, optimizations, or semantic changes allowed.

- **Strict preservation of public interface and structure:** Keep verbatim all class names, function and method names, their signatures (parameter names, order, return types if specified), and class inheritance exactly as in the input. Maintain all class/object scaffolding and nesting intact, without renaming or restructuring these elements.

- **Aggressive, multilayered transformations on all internal code details except preserved identifiers:**

  - **Exhaustively rename all local variables, parameters (except those in preserved signatures), and temporary identifiers to freshly minted, unrelated, context-appropriate names never present in the original code. No reuse of original local or temporary names allowed.**

  - **Global rewrite of all control structures:**

    - Convert every loop into a logically equivalent alternate form selected from: for, while, repeat-until, recursion (including tail recursion), or unrolled loops combined with conditionals.

    - Split, merge, reorder, or restructure conditionals—replace compound conditions with nested ifs and vice versa; change guard clauses into early returns or deferred return variables; apply De Morgan’s laws to invert/alter boolean expressions.

    - Change control flow drastically by introducing new intermediate steps or consolidating multiple steps, ensuring no change in behavior or state transition.

  - **Deep expression restructuring:** 

    - Replace arithmetic expressions by equivalent formulations (e.g., a+b ↔ b+a, expand/collapse compound operators like +=, use identity transformations, reorder independent operations).

    - Rewrite logical expressions through identities, negations, contrapositives, or alternate equivalences.

    - Substitute all literal constants with semantically identical but differently expressed equivalents (e.g., replace 4 with 2+2, 1 with (3-2), or constants derived via named constants or helper functions).

  - **Data access and traversal variations:** Iterate data structures in forward vs backward order where results are unchanged; replace direct indexing with equivalent computations; substitute built-in calls with local helper function calls or inline equivalents while preserving functional correctness.

  - **Introduce, remove, or reposition intermediate temporary variables to reorganize evaluation order, expression grouping, and state updates, while ensuring all dependencies and final results remain correct.**

  - **Thoroughly vary formatting:** use different indentation, spacing, line breaks, keyword casing, block delimiters, and style conventions so the output appears stylistically independent of the original pseudocode.

- **No changes to the algorithms, data structures, or conceptual steps implemented by the pseudocode; keep all logic fully intact and equivalent.**

- **Universal applicability:** This transformation applies generally to any valid pseudocode input regardless of domain, problem type, or coding style.

- **Output only the transformed pseudocode text itself, as a cohesive, standalone block. Do not add any explanations, comments, metadata, or annotations.**

- **Prioritize layered, orthogonal rewriting tactics combining syntax refactoring, identifier renaming, semantic-preserving control flow reshaping, expression recasting, and formatting overhaul to achieve maximal syntactic deviation from the original pseudocode.**

In summary:

Produce rewritten pseudocode that appears as a completely independently authored, stylistically unique, and lexically disjoint implementation with zero alterations to class or function names/signatures and zero semantic deviation. Your output must be self-contained pseudocode only, preserving all public interfaces verbatim, while maximizing all other syntactic, structural, and lexical transformation dimensions.
