Given a pseudocode implementation of an algorithm or function, determine whether it is *reproducible*—that is, whether a correct and complete implementation derived solely from this pseudocode would *pass all unit tests* for any valid inputs relevant to the described problem, without errors, exceptions, or undefined behavior.

**Reproducibility Criteria:**

- **Complete specification:** Every step, variable, and operation necessary for execution is fully described.
- **Determinism:** The pseudocode leads to a single, unambiguous behavior for every valid input.
- **Logical correctness:** There are no logical errors, omissions, or contradictions that would cause failures or incorrect outputs.
- **Variable and state clarity:** All variables and data structures are clearly declared, initialized, and used within their valid scope.
- **Control flow rigor:** Conditionals, loops, switches, and function calls are comprehensive and handle all edge and corner cases.
- **Boundary conditions:** Special cases (empty inputs, minimum/maximum values, potential overflows or underflows) are explicitly accounted for or clearly impossible.
- **Consistent and precise notation:** References (e.g., indexing, function parameters) are always valid and unambiguous.
- **No latent assumptions or missing definitions:** There are no implicit dependencies on unstated procedures, data formats, or external conditions.

**Instructions:**

1. Carefully analyze the entire pseudocode. Identify *any* potential cause—however subtle or implicit—that would prevent any correct implementation derived from this pseudocode from passing every unit test for all valid inputs.

2. If the pseudocode meets **all** reproducibility criteria above, showing no gaps, ambiguities, or potential failures, output exactly:

```
1
```

3. Otherwise—if there is even a single missing detail, ambiguity, logical flaw, uncontrolled edge case, or anything else that could cause test failures, output exactly:

```
0
```

4. Output **only one digit (1 or 0) per input pseudocode**, in the order pseudocodes are provided. Do **not** output any additional text, explanation, formatting, or whitespace before or after the digit.

**Additional Guidelines for Your Judgment:**

- Be conservative: when in doubt about clarity or completeness, favor `0`.
- Do not assume missing initializations, declarations, or edge case handling unless clearly stated.
- Confirm that loops and conditions cover *all* relevant scenarios without infinite loops or premature terminations.
- Verify all operators and assignments are fully defined and unambiguous.
- Ensure all function calls or sub-algorithms invoked are either fully described or clearly standard/common with no ambiguity.
- Pseudocode should be precise enough that any competent programmer translating it into code would implement a robust solution passing all tests.
- Ignore style, verbosity, or minor syntactic details—focus solely on logical and specification completeness and determinism.

---

**Summary:**

- Output `1` iff pseudocode is entirely unambiguous, logically sound, fully specified, and guarantees passing all unit tests.
- Output `0` otherwise.
- Output only the single digit, repeatedly for each pseudocode input, matching input order.
- No extra text or formatting.

This is a strict reproducibility check: only perfectly complete, deterministic, and logically sound pseudocodes that unambiguously guarantee passing *all* unit tests should receive `1`; all others must be rejected with `0`.
