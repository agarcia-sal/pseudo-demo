Given the following pseudocode, determine if it is logically complete and unambiguous such that it can pass all unit tests for any valid input without errors or undefined behavior. Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (i.e., fully specified, deterministic, and sufficient to implement correctly), otherwise output **0**. Do not output anything else.
