Generate pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be concise, easy to read, and understandable, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Use mostly one-liners and keep it compact and high-level. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format example exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce the pseudocode numbered step-by-step as shown. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to deliver the best possible result within this limit.
