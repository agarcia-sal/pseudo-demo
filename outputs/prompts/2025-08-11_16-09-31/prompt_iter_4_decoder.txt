Translate the given pseudocode into a single, clean, efficient, and well-structured Python program that reads input exclusively using `input()` (with no prompt strings). Enclose all code within one Python code block formatted as follows:

```python
# Your complete translated Python code here
```

Your code must:

- Be logically correct and optimized for performance to execute within a 5-second time limit on typical competitive programming inputs.
- Use appropriate algorithms and data structures to ensure efficiency.
- Include necessary imports from standard Python libraries as needed, but avoid unnecessary or superfluous code.
- Avoid any explanatory comments or output besides what the problem logic requires.
- Handle input/output exactly as implied by the pseudocode, reading input via `input()` calls without prompts, parsing and processing accordingly.
- Not include separator lines or extra text output.

Focus exclusively on delivering a fully working, high-performance Python implementation that best captures the pseudocodeâ€™s intent and runs within time constraints.
