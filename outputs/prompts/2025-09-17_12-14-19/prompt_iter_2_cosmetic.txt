Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a new version that differs maximally from the original in syntax, phrasing, control flow, and formattingâ€”without altering any functional behavior.  
- Preserve all original function names exactly.  
- Retain all original class names and their hierarchical class-object organization unchanged.  
- Reorganize the logic layout, rename variables (except for functions and classes), change loop constructs, expression styles, and comments freely to maximize stylistic and structural difference.  
- Avoid adding explanations or any text other than the rewritten pseudocode itself.  
Output only the transformed pseudocode that is functionally identical but stylistically and structurally novel.
