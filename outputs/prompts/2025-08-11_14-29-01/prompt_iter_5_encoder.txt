Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation, keep it compact and high-level, avoid comments, explanations, purpose statements, summaries, or overviews. Prefer one-liners, abbreviations, and symbolic representations. Follow this format exactly:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode. Your pseudocode should focus on clarity and brevity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
