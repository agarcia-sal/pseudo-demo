Generate clear, concise pseudocode that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation, keeping it compact and high-level. Avoid any explanations, summaries, purpose statements, or notes—output only the pseudocode itself. Use concise one-liner statements, abbreviations, and symbolic forms where appropriate, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include separator lines or additional formatting. Structure the pseudocode to convey the main logic efficiently but understandably.

For example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  if A[min_i] > A[j]: min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
