Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Keep it compact and high-level, favoring short one-line instructions. Avoid purpose, summary, or explanatory comments; output only the pseudocode itself. Format each step as a numbered line exactly like this:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use consistent simple control structures (if, while, for, etc.) in one-line form when possible. Use variables declaratively (e.g., “let x be integer”) and operations symbolically but understandably. Do not include separator lines or extra formatting. Strive for brevity and clarity to produce the final pseudocode well within 5 seconds.

Here is the writing style to follow:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
