Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations, favoring compact, high-level one-liners. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanatory notes—only pseudocode. Follow this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second timeout.
