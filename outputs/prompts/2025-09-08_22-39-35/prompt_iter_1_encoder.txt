Generate pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be concise, easy to read, and understandable, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate. Use mostly one-liners and keep it high-level. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, notes, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this numbered line format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for compactness and clarity without comments. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
