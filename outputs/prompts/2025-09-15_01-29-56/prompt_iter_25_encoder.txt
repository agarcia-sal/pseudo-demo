Write easy-to-read, concise pseudocode that directly captures the logic from the problem description, preserving original class names, method names, and their structure exactly as given. Use natural language with compact, high-level expressions, symbolic assignments, abbreviations, and one-liners whenever possible. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, explanations, or comments—output strictly pseudocode only. Prefer clarity and brevity while keeping pseudocode close in style and naming to the source code. Use this numbered line format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Retain original function signatures and class declarations verbatim. Use consistent indentation for readability but do not include separator lines or extra formatting. For example, given this code:

```
def calc_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    avg = total / len(nums)
    return avg
```

Output:

1. FUNCTION calc_average(list_of_numbers)  
2.   SET total_sum TO 0  
3.   FOR each number IN list_of_numbers  
4.    INCREMENT total_sum BY number  
5.   SET average_value TO total_sum DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF list_of_numbers  
6.   RETURN average_value  
7. END FUNCTION
