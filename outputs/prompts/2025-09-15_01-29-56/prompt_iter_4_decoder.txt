Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code, strictly preserving all class names, function names, and structural elements exactly as in the pseudocode. Your translation should:

- Enclose the entire Python code inside a single code block as follows:

```python
# translated code here
```

- Keep the original class and method signatures and maintain their exact names.
- Accurately convert all control flow, variable assignments, and logic from pseudocode to Python syntax.
- Ensure the code is syntactically correct and runnable as-is, with no missing definitions or incomplete constructs.
- Focus on correctness, readability, and performance within a 5-second execution constraint.
- Avoid adding any explanations, comments, or documentation outside the code block.
- You may use any standard Python library if it helps optimize or clarify the implementation.
- Do not introduce placeholder code, partial solutions, or extraneous outputâ€”return only the complete translated Python code.

Strict adherence to these instructions will yield the best possible translation results.
