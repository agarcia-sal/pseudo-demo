Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description without any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Use a compact, high-level style with natural language, one-liners, symbolic assignments, and abbreviations where suitable. Do not include notes, comments, or explanations. Follow this numbered line format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second execution limit. The output should be only pseudocode, like this example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
