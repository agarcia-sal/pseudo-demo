Translate the provided pseudocode into precise, executable, and optimized Python code, strictly preserving all class names, function names, method signatures, and structural hierarchies exactly as presented in the pseudocode. Your output must:

- Produce only the final Python code enclosed in a single Python code block as shown:

```python
# translated code here
```

- Maintain exact naming for classes, functions, and variables as given.
- Accurately convert all pseudocode control flows, operations, and logic into idiomatic and correct Python syntax.
- Implement all necessary supporting structures (e.g., class constructors, imports) as required for a self-contained, runnable solution.
- Optimize for clarity and performance (target execution within 5 seconds) without sacrificing correctness.
- Avoid any explanations, comments, placeholder code, or extraneous output outside the code block.
- Use standard Python libraries or modules judiciously if they enhance correctness or efficiency.
- Handle edge cases implied by the pseudocode where applicable.
- Do not rewrite or omit any logic elements present in the pseudocode.

Strict compliance with these instructions ensures the highest fidelity and reliability in translation from pseudocode to working Python code.
