Generate pseudocode from the given problem description without providing any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not include notes, comments, or explanations—only pseudocode. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language where appropriate, while remaining compact and high-level. Prefer concise one-liners, symbolic representations, and standard abbreviations. Follow the format of numbered steps as in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity with brevity, avoiding detailed low-level instructions, and producing code that can be quickly and correctly interpreted. Your function has a 5-second timeout; ensure the output meets this constraint.
