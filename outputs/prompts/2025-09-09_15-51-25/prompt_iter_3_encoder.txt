Write clear, concise pseudocode that is easy to read and understand, using mostly natural language with symbolic shortcuts and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Do not include any purpose statements, explanations, comments, or summaries—output only the pseudocode steps. Maintain the original function name exactly as in the source code. Prefer mostly one-line statements, clear control structures (if, while, for), and symbolic assignments (←, ++, --). Follow this exact numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use natural, imperative style phrasing (e.g., "let", "set", "read", "return") and concise expressions for conditions and operations. Avoid separator lines, verbose detail, or verbose naming. Output code flows as a simple numbered list that directly expresses the computational logic at a consistent high abstraction level, suitable for immediate understanding and rapid reasoning.
