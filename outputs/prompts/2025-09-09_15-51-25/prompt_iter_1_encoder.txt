Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations, keeping it compact and high-level. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only pseudocode steps. Prefer one-liners and clear control structures. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for maximum clarity within a 5-second generation limit.
