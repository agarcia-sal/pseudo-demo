Write concise, clear pseudocode that is easy to read and understand, using mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations, keeping it compact and high-level.  
Exact original function names must be retained.  
Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—only pseudocode steps.  
Prefer one-liners and straightforward control structures.  
Follow this numbered format exactly:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting.  
Use natural phrases for declarations and operations (e.g., "let", "set", "read", "return"), concise conditionals (if, else if, else), loops (for, while), and assignments with ←.  
Keep the entire pseudocode self-contained, minimal, and efficient so it can be generated within 5 seconds.
