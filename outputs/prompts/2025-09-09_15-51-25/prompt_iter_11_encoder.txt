Write concise, clear pseudocode preserving the exact function names from the original code. Use mostly natural language with symbolic operators and common abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Avoid explanations, summaries, or comments—output only the pseudocode steps. Prefer single-line statements and simple control structures to enhance readability and brevity. Format with numbered lines starting at 1, and indent substeps by one tab per level, following this style exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Declare variables naturally, e.g., “let x be integer” or “x ← 0.” Use standard pseudocode keywords (for, if, else, while, return, etc.) together with symbols (←, ++, ≤, ≠, //). When present, begin function pseudocode with:

in function <function_name>(parameters...)

Produce output only in pseudocode form, minimal yet fully capturing the original code’s logic, structure, and naming for easy back-translation. Avoid separator lines or extraneous formatting. The output must be generated efficiently within 5 seconds while maximizing accuracy and clarity.
