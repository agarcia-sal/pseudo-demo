Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that directly mirrors the logic and function names of the original code. Use mostly natural language with symbolic forms and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode steps. Prefer one-line statements and clear control structures. Maintain the original function name exactly as given. Number each line as in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not add separator lines or extra formatting. Emphasize clarity and brevity to produce directly translatable, runnable pseudocode within a 5-second generation limit.
