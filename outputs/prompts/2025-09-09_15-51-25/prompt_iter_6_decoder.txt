Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, well-structured Python code that uses the exact function name and variable names as described in the pseudocode. The code should be directly runnable without wrapping inside any class or additional constructs unless the pseudocode explicitly specifies otherwise (e.g., class definitions).  

Enclose your entire output strictly inside a single Python code block annotated with ```python and ```.

Make sure to:  
- Match the function signature and name exactly as implied or explicitly stated in the pseudocode.  
- Define any necessary data structures completely (e.g., classes like ListNode if mentioned).  
- Import any relevant standard libraries only if required to produce an efficient and clean solution.  
- Write clear, concise, and correct Python code optimized for readability and performance, suitable to run within 5 seconds.  
- Avoid including any explanations, comments beyond those explicitly implied by pseudocode, or any extra output besides the code itself.  
- Do not include any usage, test calls, or references to external classes such as `Solution`.  
- Where pseudocode leaves out details (like input types), use commonly accepted Python defaults or explicit type hints if possible.  

This will ensure your translated code is directly usable and matches the intended logic seamlessly.
