Write concise, clear pseudocode directly from the problem description, keeping the exact original function name and parameters. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notations and abbreviations for compactness and clarity. Prefer high-level one-liners for simple statements, expressions, and conditions, and straightforward indentation-based blocks for control flow without extra verbosity. Represent common operations symbolically (e.g., ← for assignment, ≠ for not equal), use natural constructs like "for", "if", "while", "let", "set", and avoid comments, explanations, summaries, or separators. Output only the pseudocode in this exact numbered list format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
