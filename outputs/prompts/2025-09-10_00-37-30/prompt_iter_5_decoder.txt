Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and fully functional Python code. Please adhere to the following requirements:

- Preserve the original function name and signature exactly as stated in the pseudocode.
- Implement all logic accurately and efficiently, prioritizing clarity and Pythonic style.
- Import any standard Python libraries if needed, but avoid unnecessary imports.
- Include relevant type hints where appropriate for clarity.
- Do not define or assume any classes or wrappers (e.g., no `Solution` class) unless explicitly required by the pseudocode.
- Enclose the entire code within a Python code block formatted as follows:

```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

- Ensure the code can run independently without external dependencies and produce correct results within 5 seconds for typical inputs.
- Avoid adding extraneous comments or separator lines; provide only the necessary code implementing the pseudocode logic.
