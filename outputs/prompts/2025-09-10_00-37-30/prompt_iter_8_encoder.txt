Write concise, clear pseudocode directly from the given problem description, preserving the exact original function name. Use natural, high-level language with symbolic notations and standard abbreviations to maximize brevity and clarity. Favor compact one-line statements and conditions whenever possible. Express control flow simply and logically, avoiding redundant words or unnecessary complexity. The pseudocode must be easy to read and implement with minimal interpretation. Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or separators. Use this exact numbered format with indentation for nested blocks:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example of desired style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
