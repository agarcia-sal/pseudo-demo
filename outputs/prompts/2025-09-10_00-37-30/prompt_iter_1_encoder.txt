Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic notations and abbreviations, favoring one-liners and a compact, high-level style. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should be clear and understandable, avoiding verbosity. Prioritize brevity and clarity to produce the best result within a 5-second runtime limit.
