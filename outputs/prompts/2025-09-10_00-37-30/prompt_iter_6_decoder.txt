Translate the provided pseudocode into correct, efficient, and readable Python code by strictly following these instructions:

- Use the exact function name and signature given in the pseudocode without adding classes or wrappers (e.g., no `Solution` class).
- Implement all described logic precisely and idiomatically using modern Python standards.
- Import only necessary standard Python libraries if they are required by the pseudocode; otherwise, avoid imports.
- Add appropriate type hints for all function parameters and return values, matching usage from the pseudocode.
- Ensure your code is self-contained, able to run independently, and produces correct outputs within 5 seconds for typical inputs.
- Include any auxiliary code such as essential data structures or classes only if explicitly indicated or indispensable.
- **Critically, do NOT assume or add any calls like `Solution().functionName(...)`; the function must be standalone.**
- Provide the complete function code and any necessary supporting code _only_; do not add extra explanations or unrelated comments.
- Enclose your entire response in a single Python code block formatted exactly as follows:

```python
# Your fully functional Python code here
```

This approach guarantees clarity, correctness, and compatibility with standard testing setups.
