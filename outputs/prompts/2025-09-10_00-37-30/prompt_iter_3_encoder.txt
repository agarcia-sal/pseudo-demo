Write clear, concise pseudocode directly from the given problem description, preserving the exact original function name. Use a natural, high-level style with symbolic notations and abbreviations wherever appropriate to maximize brevity and readability, favoring compact one-liners for simple statements and conditions. Structure control flow plainly, avoiding unnecessary verbosity or complexity. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand while being suitable for direct implementation with minimal interpretation. Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or separator lines—output only the pseudocode. Follow this exact numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example style to follow:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
