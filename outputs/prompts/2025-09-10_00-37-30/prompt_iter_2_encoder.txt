Write concise, clear pseudocode directly from the given problem description, preserving the original function name exactly. Use a high-level, natural language style with symbolic notations and abbreviations, prioritizing brevity and readability. Express logic preferably in one-liners where appropriate, using minimal but precise syntax. Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode itself. Follow this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Produce easy-to-read pseudocode that is compact yet understandable, structuring control flow and operations plainly without unnecessary verbosity. Do not use separator lines or extraneous formatting. The pseudocode should be suitable for direct implementation with minimal interpretation effort.
