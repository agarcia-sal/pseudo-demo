Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a high-level style with natural language, one-liners, symbolic operators, and abbreviations. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, notes, or comments—only provide pseudocode steps. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for compactness and clarity. Use loops, conditionals, and assignments directly. Do not explain or annotate. Your output should be purely the pseudocode that implements the solution within a 5-second runtime constraint.
