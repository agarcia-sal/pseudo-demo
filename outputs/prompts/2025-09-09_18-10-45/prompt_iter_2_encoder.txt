Write clear, concise, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description and original code. Use natural language combined with compact, high-level expressions, symbolic assignments, and abbreviations. Keep the original function names intact. Produce only the pseudocode—no explanations, comments, summaries, or notes.

Prefer:  
- One-liners where appropriate  
- Minimalist, symbolic style  
- Consistent use of ← for assignments and standard control structures (if, while, for)  
- Avoid verbose constructs; merge statements logically for brevity and clarity

Follow exactly this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include separator lines or extra formatting. Output just the numbered pseudocode lines corresponding to the logic of the original function.  

Optimize for brevity, clarity, and adherence to natural, high-level pseudocode rather than low-level code translations. Your function has a 5-second runtime budget—focus on generating the best pseudocode within this constraint.
