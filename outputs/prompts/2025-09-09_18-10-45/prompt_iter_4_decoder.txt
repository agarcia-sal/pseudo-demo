Translate the following pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and efficient Python code. Your implementation must:

- Preserve all original function names and signatures exactly as given in the pseudocode.
- Include any necessary supporting classes, imports, or helper functions implied by the pseudocode.
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and efficient performance to run within a 5-second timeout.
- Make use of built-in Python features and standard libraries where appropriate to optimize readability and speed.
- Enclose the entire translated code ONLY within a single Python code block formatted like:
  
```python
# Your translated code here
```

Do NOT include any extra explanatory text, comments beyond what clarifies the code, or separator lines.  
Focus on producing a ready-to-run, well-structured Python solution that can be directly executed or tested.
