Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use compact, high-level expressions with natural language, one-liners, symbolic assignments, and abbreviations. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only pseudocode instructions. Follow this format precisely:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and brevity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for best output within this limit.
