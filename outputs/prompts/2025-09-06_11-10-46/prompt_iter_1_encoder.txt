Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be compact, high-level, and use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where possible. Prefer one-liners and avoid comments, explanations, or any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Follow a clear numbered step format, for example:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Focus solely on the pseudocode itself without additional notes. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible output within this limit.
