Evaluate the pseudocode provided within each of the following code blocks below:  
```python  
<Insert pseudocode here>  
```  

For each pseudocode snippet, determine whether it is **unconditionally fully reproducible**, meaning it will pass **all possible unit tests for all valid inputs** without relying on any unstated assumptions, external context, or clarifications.

**Full Reproducibility Criteria:**  
1. **Complete and explicit logic:** Every step is fully specified, leaving no operations, calculations, or necessary details implicit or omitted.  
2. **Exhaustive input coverage:** All valid inputs, including edge cases, boundary conditions, and potential input variations, are explicitly handled and produce correct results.  
3. **Deterministic and unambiguous:** The pseudocode’s meaning and control flow can only be interpreted in one way; no vagueness or multiple plausible readings are possible.  
4. **Self-contained:** No external dependencies, references, or context beyond what is within the code block affect correctness—pseudocode stands alone.  
5. **Well-defined input/output interfaces:** Inputs and outputs are clearly described such that any test harness can interface correctly and verify correctness.

**Instructions:**  
- Consider **only** the pseudocode inside the ```python ... ``` code blocks; completely ignore any surrounding text.  
- For each snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - Output **1** if the pseudocode meets **all** the above criteria and is guaranteed to pass every unit test on all valid inputs.  
  - Output **0** if it fails to meet even one criterion—for example, if it is incomplete, ambiguous, underspecified, partial, or does not guarantee correct behavior universally.  
- When multiple pseudocode snippets are provided sequentially, output a concatenated string of digits (e.g., "1010"), where each digit corresponds exactly to the snippet’s reproducibility evaluation in order.  
- **Strictly output nothing besides this digit string:** no spaces, line breaks, explanations, or any other characters.

Adhere precisely to this output specification for reliable automated assessment.
