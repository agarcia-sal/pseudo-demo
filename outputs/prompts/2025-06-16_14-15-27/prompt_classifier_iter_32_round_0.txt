Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output exactly one digit per snippet—concatenated strictly in the order presented—with **no spaces, separators, explanations, or any additional characters**.

**Output:**  
- Output **1** if and only if the snippet is **fully reproducible**: it is a completely self-contained, explicit, and fully deterministic specification that guarantees **every** correct implementation derived solely from it will pass **all possible unit tests** (including typical, edge, boundary, invalid, and exceptional cases) without ambiguity, unstated assumptions, omissions, or undefined behavior.  
- Output **0** otherwise.

**Determine reproducibility by rigorously verifying ALL the following criteria without exception:**

1. **Exhaustive and explicit input definition:**  
 - Every input, parameter, and data structure is fully named, typed, and precisely defined with clear domains, allowed values, formats, and initial states.  
 - No implicit, assumed, or deferred input-related information.

2. **Comprehensive output and state-change description:**  
 - Every possible output, return value, side effect, and final state is fully and precisely described for *all* valid and invalid inputs.  
 - Output/error formats, exceptions, and state changes are unambiguous and complete.

3. **Deterministic, unambiguous algorithmic logic:**  
 - All computational steps, control flows (branches, loops, recursion), and state transitions are exhaustively and precisely specified with no vagueness or omissions.  
 - Every possible execution path and termination condition is clearly accounted for.

4. **Definitive and explicit error and edge-case management:**  
 - All invalid inputs, exceptional conditions, errors, infinite loops, deadlocks, and abnormal terminations are detected and handled explicitly within the snippet.  
 - No undefined, silent failures, or nonterminating behavior allowed.

5. **Absolute self-containment with zero external dependencies:**  
 - All auxiliary procedures, helper functions, constants, data structures, or definitions required to execute or understand the snippet are fully included.  
 - No reliance on undocumented globals, external libraries, environmental state, or implicit conventions.

6. **No hidden assumptions or reliance on external knowledge:**  
 - No assumptions about implicit language semantics, domain knowledge, or unwritten rules.  
 - All semantics and conventions are explicitly encoded without requiring outside context or cultural familiarity.

**Instructions:**  
- Independently analyze each provided pseudocode snippet against the above definitive criteria.  
- Output exactly one digit per snippet, concatenated in input order, with **no spaces, punctuation, or commentary**.  
- Output digits must be strictly `0` or `1`.  
- Respond deterministically and efficiently within 5 seconds per batch.

**Example:**  
If three snippets are input, and the first and third snippets meet full reproducibility while the second does not, output:  
`101`

This evaluation treats reproducibility as an absolute property ensuring any derivable implementation from the snippet must pass all conceivable unit tests without any ambiguity or dependency on external context. The framework explicitly guards against all forms of underspecification, implicit assumptions, or incomplete definitions, maximizing precision and reliability of the classification.
