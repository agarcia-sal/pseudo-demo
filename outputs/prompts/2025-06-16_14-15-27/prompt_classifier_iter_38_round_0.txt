Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently for *full reproducibility* and output exactly one binary digit per snippet, concatenated in the precise order of input, with no spaces, punctuation, newlines, or any characters other than `0` or `1`. Output nothing else, no explanations, no delimiters.

**Output Definition:**  
- Output `1` if and only if each snippet, *on its own*, completely and unambiguously specifies an implementation guaranteed to pass *every conceivable unit test*—covering normal, boundary, invalid inputs, errors, concurrency and resource constraints, and performance—without any assumptions, clarifications, or external context.  
- Output `0` otherwise.

### Reproducibility Requirements (All MUST be fully and explicitly met by the snippet alone):

1. **Definitive Input Specification:**  
 - All inputs (variables, data structures) are explicitly declared with complete typing, valid and invalid boundary definitions, and input domains fully enumerated or precisely described.  
 - Input environment and initial state conditions are unambiguously defined, leaving no gaps or implicit assumptions.

2. **Explicit, Deterministic Algorithm Description:**  
 - The algorithm’s control flow (including loops, recursion, branching), data transformations, and state mutations are exhaustively and precisely specified, with no ambiguity or underspecification.  
 - Termination conditions and behavior under infinite loops or recursion are clearly handled or indicated.

3. **Comprehensive Output and Effects Coverage:**  
 - Every possible output, return value, side effect, or state change for all code paths is fully and explicitly detailed; partial or implied behaviors are insufficient.  
 - No aspect of the final state or output is left undefined or ambiguous for any case.

4. **Complete Error, Exception, and Edge Case Handling:**  
 - All invalid inputs, resource or concurrency constraints, exceptions, and exceptional or edge cases are explicitly anticipated and addressed to prevent undefined or erroneous outcomes.

5. **Fully Self-Contained and Independent:**  
 - The snippet must include all necessary data definitions, helper procedures, constants, and environment setup.  
 - No reliance on external code, libraries, global state, runtime environments, or implicit behavior allowed.

6. **No Implicit Knowledge or Cultural Assumptions:**  
 - No default behaviors, naming conventions, idioms, or domain-specific knowledge outside the snippet are assumed.  
 - Every detail necessary to implement the algorithm correctly and completely must be explicitly encoded.

### Evaluation Method:

- Evaluate each snippet *strictly on its own*, applying the above criteria with zero tolerance for inference, guesswork, or external knowledge.  
- Produce a minimal binary string of `0` and `1` digits only, corresponding precisely to the input snippet order.  
- Do not add any commentary, formatting, or additional characters.  
- Processing all snippets must complete within 5 seconds.

### Definition Reminder:  
*Reproducible* means the snippet guarantees—without need for any external context or assumptions—that *every* implementation derived from it will pass *all* unit tests, covering all standard, boundary, invalid, concurrency, error, and performance scenarios.

### Illustrative Example:  
For three input snippets where only the 2nd and 3rd satisfy reproducibility, the output is:
