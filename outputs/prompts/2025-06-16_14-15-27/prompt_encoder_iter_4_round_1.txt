Translate the given code into concise, uniform pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow and structure, expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals clearly and simply. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations, producing a compact and high-level representation that is easy to read. Favor single-line statements whenever feasible, allowing omission of less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure but do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines, strictly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
