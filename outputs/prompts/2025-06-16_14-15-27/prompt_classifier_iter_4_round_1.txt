Evaluate the pseudocode enclosed within the following code block:  
```python  
<Insert pseudocode here>  
```  

Your task is to determine if this pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, meaning it is guaranteed to pass **all conceivable unit tests for every valid input** without requiring any external assumptions or clarifications.

**Definition of Full Reproducibility:**  
- The logic and instructions are **completely explicit**, with no missing or implied steps.  
- The pseudocode handles **every valid input scenario**, including edge cases and boundary conditions, in a deterministic and exhaustive manner.  
- Control flow, data structures, inputs, and outputs are described **unambiguously**, such that no different but equally plausible interpretations exist.  
- The snippet is **self-contained**, with no dependency on or references to any external context, assumptions, or definitions not included within the block.

**Evaluation Instructions:**  
- Examine only the pseudocode inside the ```python ... ``` block provided, ignoring all other text.  
- For each pseudocode snippet evaluated, output exactly one digit:  
  - Output **1** if the pseudocode meets all criteria for full reproducibility and guarantees success on all unit tests across all valid inputs.  
  - Output **0** if it falls short in any aspect: is incomplete, ambiguous, underspecified, or does not guarantee correct behavior in all cases.  
- When multiple snippets are input sequentially, output a concatenated string of digits corresponding precisely to each snippet’s reproducibility evaluation, preserving their order.  
- **Do not output anything besides this sequence of digits.** No whitespace, no explanations, no newlines.

Your output must strictly conform to this format for automated evaluation.

By explicitly defining full reproducibility in terms of explicitness, exhaustiveness, determinism, unambiguity, and self-containment—and by enforcing a strict, minimal output format—your assessment will align precisely with the requirement to guarantee passing all unit tests under all valid inputs.
