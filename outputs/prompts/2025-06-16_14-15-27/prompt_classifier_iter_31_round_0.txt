Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output a single digit per snippet—concatenated strictly in input order—with **no spaces, punctuation, explanations, or any extraneous characters**.

**Output:**  
- Output **1** if and only if the snippet is **fully reproducible:**  
 it provides a comprehensive, self-sufficient, and fully deterministic specification that ensures **every** correct implementation faithfully derived from it will pass **all** conceivable unit tests—including normal, edge, boundary, invalid, and exceptional cases—without ambiguity, implicit assumptions, omissions, or undefined behavior.  
- Output **0** otherwise.

---

**Reproducibility determination must strictly verify ALL the following without exception:**

1. **Complete, explicit, and unambiguous input specification:**  
 - All inputs, parameters, and data structures are fully named, typed, and defined with exact domains, allowed values, formats, and initial conditions.  
 - No information is left implicit, assumed, or deferred.

2. **Exhaustive, exact output and state-change specification:**  
 - Resulting outputs and all side effects or final states are fully described for **every possible input** (valid or invalid).  
 - Output formats, types, values, error signals, or exceptions are precisely and exhaustively listed.

3. **Fully deterministic, precise algorithmic steps:**  
 - All operations, control flows (branches, loops, recursion), and state transitions are explicitly and completely defined; no steps or conditions are omitted or vague.  
 - Every possible execution path and termination condition is fully covered.

4. **Explicit, rigorous error and edge-case handling:**  
 - All sources of failure, invalid inputs, exceptions, infinite execution, deadlocks, or abnormal termination are detected and handled deterministically within the snippet.  
 - No silent failures, lacks of definition, or nontermination allowed.

5. **Absolute self-containment with zero external dependencies:**  
 - The snippet includes every auxiliary definition, helper procedure, constant, or structure required.  
 - It does not rely on undocumented globals, external states, libraries, implicit protocols, or environmental factors absent from the provided code.

6. **No reliance on unstated assumptions, conventions, or domain knowledge:**  
 - No reliance on implicit language semantics, cultural, domain-specific knowledge, or unwritten rules.  
 - All necessary semantics and conventions must be clearly and explicitly encoded.

**Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet given as input, carefully analyze it against these criteria.  
- Output exactly one digit per snippet, concatenated in input order, with **no spaces, separators, or commentary**.  
- Output only the digits `0` or `1`.  
- Respond deterministically within 5 seconds per batch.

**Example:**  
If three snippets are input, and based on the above criteria the first and third are reproducible, the second is not, output:  
`101`

This prompt consolidates and sharpens the evaluation to appraise reproducibility as an absolute property of self-contained, precise, and unambiguous specification that guarantees universal pass of all unit tests, with no tolerance for gaps, assumptions, or external dependencies. It enforces rigorous, exhaustive criteria to maximize correctness and reliability of the classification.
