Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output exactly one digit per snippet—concatenated strictly in the order given—with no spaces, punctuation, explanations, or any characters other than digits.

**Output:**  
- Output **1** if the snippet unambiguously defines a fully reproducible algorithm meeting *all* of the following stringent requirements:  
 • All inputs, outputs, states, and side effects are exhaustively and explicitly defined—including types, domains, formats, initial/final states—and account for every valid, invalid, edge, and exceptional case.  
 • The entire computational procedure (control flows, data transformations, branching, looping, recursion, termination) is deterministic, complete, and leaves no ambiguity or implicit assumptions.  
 • Every error, exception, boundary condition, infinite loop, deadlock, and abnormal termination scenario is explicitly handled or ruled out with no possibility of undefined or silent failures.  
 • The snippet is self-contained—defining all auxiliary elements such as helper functions, constants, data structures, and avoids any dependencies on external code, global state, runtime environment, or unstated domain knowledge.  
 • No reliance on implicit conventions, language-specific semantics, or cultural/contextual knowledge; all semantics must be encoded explicitly and clearly within the snippet.

- Output **0** otherwise.

**Assessment criteria (apply all without exception):**

1. **Input Specification Completeness:** Every input element (parameters, data structures) is fully described with explicit types, valid ranges, formats, and initial conditions. No info is implicit or omitted.

2. **Output and State Finalization Clarity:** Outputs, return values, all side effects, and states after execution—across every possible input and scenario—are explicitly and precisely stated.

3. **Algorithmic Determinism and Exhaustiveness:** Control flows, data operations, looping, recursion, and termination are fully detailed without vagueness or gaps. All execution paths are accounted for.

4. **Robust Error and Edge Case Handling:** All invalid inputs, exceptions, error states, infinite loops, and abnormal terminations are explicitly addressed and resolved.

5. **Self-Containment and Independence:** No external dependencies, hidden globals, or unstated helper definitions. All necessary components/definitions reside fully within the snippet.

6. **Absence of Implicit Assumptions:** Avoid unstated conventions, domain expertise dependencies, language-specific behaviors, or cultural knowledge. All aspects must be explicit and unambiguous.

**Instructions:**  
- Analyze each snippet individually against all above criteria.  
- Output one digit per snippet (`1` or `0`), concatenated in order with no delimiters.  
- Don’t output anything other than these digits—no explanations, spaces, punctuation, or newline characters.  
- Your judgment must be fully deterministic and efficient (complete within 5 seconds per batch).

**Example:**  
If three snippets are evaluated and only the first and third meet full reproducibility, output:  
`101`

This evaluation defines reproducibility as an absolute guarantee: any concrete implementation directly and solely derived from the given pseudocode must pass all conceivable unit tests—including edge cases and invalid inputs—without ambiguity or external context.
