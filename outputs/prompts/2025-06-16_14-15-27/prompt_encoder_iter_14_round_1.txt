Translate the provided code into compact, clear pseudocode that strictly preserves its original structure and control flow, including all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly natural language enhanced by concise symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Prioritize single-line statements when possible, even if it means omitting non-essential details, to keep the pseudocode brief and high-level. Consistently indent nested blocks to reflect code hierarchy but do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or any extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines formatted exactly like this:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
