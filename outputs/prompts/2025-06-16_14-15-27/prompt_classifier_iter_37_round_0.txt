Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently for *complete reproducibility* and output one binary digit per snippet, concatenated in the exact input order with no spaces, punctuation, newlines, or any characters other than `0` or `1`. Output nothing else.

**Output Rules:**  
- Output `1` if and only if the snippet alone fully specifies an implementation guaranteed to pass *every possible unit test*—including normal cases, boundary conditions, invalid inputs, error and exception handling, resource constraints, and performance/stress tests—without any external assumptions, clarifications, or information.  
- Output `0` otherwise.

---

**Reproducibility Criteria:**  
A snippet is reproducible (`1`) only if it meets **all** these conditions simultaneously and unequivocally, requiring no inference beyond the snippet’s explicit content:

1. **Explicit, Complete Input Definition:**  
 - All inputs are fully typed, structured, and their exact domains indicated, including valid, boundary, invalid, and exceptional inputs.  
 - Inputs and environment states are defined with no ambiguity or omissions.

2. **Deterministic, Unambiguous Algorithm Specification:**  
 - Algorithm’s logic—including control flow (loops, branches, recursion), data operations, and state changes—is described exactly and exhaustively.  
 - All decision points and state transitions are fully specified; termination or infinite behavior is explicitly accounted for.

3. **Total Output and Side-Effect Clarity:**  
 - Every output, return value, side effect, or state change is completely described for every execution path.  
 - No output or effect is underspecified or partially defined.

4. **Comprehensive Error and Exceptional State Management:**  
 - All possible errors, invalid or unexpected inputs, resource limits, concurrency issues, and exceptional conditions are explicitly anticipated and handled to avoid incorrect or undefined behavior.

5. **Self-Containment with No External Dependencies:**  
 - The snippet contains all necessary definitions: helper functions, constants, data types, and state descriptions required for faithful implementation.  
 - No reliance on external libraries, frameworks, global variables, hidden environment details, or implicit language semantics is allowed.

6. **Zero Dependence on Implicit, Cultural, or Contextual Conventions:**  
 - No assumptions about defaults, naming conventions, common idioms, or external contexts.  
 - Every semantic detail necessary for implementation is explicitly stated within the snippet.

**Evaluation Protocol:**  
- Assess each snippet *strictly and independently* against the above criteria, rejecting any requiring inference or external knowledge.  
- Immediately output one digit per snippet following input order, concatenated tightly.  
- Produce output only as a minimal string of `0` and `1` digits, no other characters or whitespace.  
- Complete evaluation within a 5-second limit for the full batch.

**Definition Recap:**  
Reproducible means a pseudocode snippet alone guarantees every possible correct implementation derived from it will pass *all* unit tests (normal, edge, error, performance) without additional assumptions or clarifications.

**Example:**  
For three snippets where only the first and third are reproducible, output:
