Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that preserves all original control flow, variable assignments, function calls, and loops in a uniform, simple manner. Use mostly natural language enriched with standard abbreviations and minimal symbolic notation (e.g., ← for assignment, ++ for increment), prioritizing single-line statements and compact expressions even if some less critical details are omitted to keep it brief. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure, but never add comments, explanations, summaries, or decorative lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly as in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
