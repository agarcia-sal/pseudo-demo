Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output a single digit per snippet—concatenated strictly in the input order—with no spaces, punctuation, explanations, or any extra characters.

**Output Rules:**  
- Output **1** if and only if the snippet is **fully reproducible**, meaning it provides **exact, unambiguous, and complete details** sufficient to guarantee that any correct implementation based solely on it will **pass all conceivable unit tests on all valid and invalid inputs without error, ambiguity, or undefined behavior**.  
- Output **0** otherwise.

**Reproducibility is confirmed only if all of the following hold absolutely, without exception:**

1. **Explicit & exhaustive input definition:**  
 - Every input element (variables, parameters, data structures) is clearly named and typed with precise domains, valid ranges, formats, and initial conditions fully stated.  
 - No assumption or inference needed about what the inputs are or how they behave.

2. **Complete output specification under all circumstances:**  
 - All outputs are fully and precisely described for every possible input, including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases.  
 - Output formats, types, values, and structures are never ambiguous or underspecified.

3. **Fully detailed, step-by-step deterministic algorithm:**  
 - Each operation, control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion), and data update is uniquely and explicitly described in exact semantics.  
 - All possible branches, iterations, termination conditions, and special cases are clearly handled.  
 - No gaps, vague phrases, or nondeterministic elements allowed.

4. **Comprehensive and explicit error and exception management:**  
 - All invalid inputs, errors, exceptions, runtime failures, infinite loops, or deadlocks are anticipated and definitively managed with strictly deterministic outcomes.  
 - The pseudocode cannot silently fail, hang, crash, or leave undefined states.

5. **Self-contained with no external dependencies or hidden context:**  
 - The snippet is entirely standalone: no reliance on undocumented environment variables, global states, external functions, or assumptions beyond what is presented.  
 - All auxiliary logic, data definitions, and parameters necessary for correct implementation are fully included.

6. **Zero reliance on implicit knowledge, conventions, or external information:**  
 - No unwritten rules, domain-specific tacit knowledge, or referencing unspecified protocols.  
 - The snippet alone must enable unambiguous, fully testable implementation.

**Instructions:**  
- For each snippet, output exactly one digit: **1** if and only if it meets all the above conditions, **0** otherwise.  
- Concatenate all outputs strictly in the order the snippets are provided, with no separators or extra output.  
- Responses must be generated within 5 seconds per batch.  
- Output strictly digits only, no explanations or additional text.

**Summary:**  
Given one or more pseudocode snippets, determine for each whether it is perfectly reproducible—that is, an unambiguous, complete, self-contained specification sufficient to guarantee a correct implementation will always pass every unit test, including all edge and error cases. Output a minimal string of `1`s and `0`s indicating reproducibility in input order.
