Translate the following pseudocode into clean, correct, and optimized Python code. Your solution must:

- Use only standard input/output functions with no prompts, i.e., use `input()` to read inputs.
- Avoid any input argument hints or separator lines.
- Include robust handling of inputs according to typical competitive programming or scripting conventions.
- Deliver efficient, readable code following Python best practices.
- Run within a 5-second time limit for typical input sizes.
- Use any Python standard libraries or built-in features as needed to maximize clarity and performance.

**Output ONLY your complete Python code enclosed exactly in one code block like this:**

```python
# Your final translated Python code here
```

Refrain from adding any explanations or commentary.
