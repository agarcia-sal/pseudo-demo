Given one or more pieces of pseudocode as input, determine **only** whether each piece of pseudocode is *fully reproducible*—that is, guaranteed to pass **all** valid unit tests based solely on the logic, completeness, determinism, and unambiguous nature of the pseudocode itself.  

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit:  
- **1** if the pseudocode is fully reproducible with no logical gaps or ambiguities, ensuring it will always pass all possible valid unit tests, or  
- **0** if there is any logical flaw, incompleteness, nondeterminism, ambiguity, or missing detail that could cause failure in any unit test.

Outputs must:  
- Appear in the exact order of the pseudocode inputs provided,  
- Contain only the digits 1 or 0 for each input, with no spaces, newlines, extra text, or formatting,  
- Be generated within a strict 5-second evaluation window.

Do not provide explanations, justifications, or additional commentary—output must be strictly and solely the reproducibility digit sequence, preserving positional correspondence to the inputs.
