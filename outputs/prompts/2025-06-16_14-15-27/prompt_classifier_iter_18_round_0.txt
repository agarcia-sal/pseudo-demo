Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, rigorously and independently evaluate each snippet to determine, with absolute certainty and no assumptions beyond the provided text, whether it guarantees reproducibility—that is, it will pass all conceivable unit tests covering the full valid input domain.

A pseudocode snippet is reproducible (output **1**) **if and only if** all the following criteria are unambiguously and explicitly fulfilled within the snippet itself:

1. **Explicit and exhaustive input/output definition:** All inputs, outputs, and intermediate variables are fully specified with precise types, formats, constraints, and allowable ranges, leaving zero ambiguity or incompleteness.

2. **Deterministic, complete logic coverage:** The snippet’s logic deterministically handles every possible valid input case, including all normal, boundary, and corner cases, without gaps, omissions, or unresolved branches.

3. **Comprehensive error and edge case management:** Every potential edge case, exceptional condition, and error state is explicitly anticipated and handled in the pseudocode, guaranteeing no undefined, partial, or inconsistent behavior occurs.

4. **Consistent, unambiguous semantics:** The instructions, control flow, state changes, and data transformations are stated clearly and without contradiction or ambiguity, yielding exactly one outcome for the same input every execution.

5. **Self-contained reproducibility guarantee:** The snippet alone, without relying on any external information, assumptions, or unstated context, suffices to pass every unit test in a fully comprehensive test suite spanning the entire input space.

For multiple pseudocode snippets provided sequentially, output a continuous string of digits—each digit **1** if the corresponding snippet meets all the above conditions, or **0** if it does not. The order of digits must match the order of the input snippets exactly.

Do **not** provide explanations, comments, or any output other than the required digits. Do **not** infer any information beyond the explicit content of each pseudocode snippet. Respond within 5 seconds per input batch.

Strictly enforce this binary, absolute reproducibility criterion and output format.
