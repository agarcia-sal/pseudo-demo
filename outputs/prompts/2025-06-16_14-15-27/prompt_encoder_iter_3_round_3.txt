Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that strictly preserves its original control flow and structure, uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to produce a compact, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode. Prefer single-line statements whenever feasible, even if that means omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure, but omit any comments, explanations, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines, exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
