Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves all original control flow structures, variable assignments, function calls, and loops, expressing them uniformly and simply. Use mostly natural language combined with standard, minimal symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep the pseudocode compact and easy to read. Prefer single-line statements wherever possible even if it means omitting less critical details, to minimize line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect code structure, but do not include any comments, summaries, explanations, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines formatted exactly like this:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
