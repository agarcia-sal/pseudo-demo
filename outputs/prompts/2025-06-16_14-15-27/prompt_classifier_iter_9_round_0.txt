Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, independently evaluate each snippet’s **reproducibility**, defined as the snippet’s ability—based solely on its presented logic, structure, and specifications—to deterministically and completely satisfy **all** possible unit tests for all valid inputs without error, ambiguity, or missing information.  
In your evaluation, strictly assess correctness (no logical errors), completeness (all necessary steps and edge cases covered), determinism (consistent behavior on identical inputs), and clarity (well-defined operations and flow). Ignore any external context or assumptions beyond what is explicitly provided.  
For each snippet, output a single digit: **1** if it is reproducible under these criteria, or **0** if it is not.  
Maintain the input order in your output: the first snippet corresponds to the first digit, the second to the second digit, and so on, with no additional text, explanations, spaces, or formatting—only the string of digits.  
Under no circumstance include any commentary, partial answers, or extra characters. Respond within 5 seconds per batch to ensure timely results.
