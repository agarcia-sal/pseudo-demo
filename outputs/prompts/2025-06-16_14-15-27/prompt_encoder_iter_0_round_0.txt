Translate the given code into easy-to-read, concise pseudocode using natural language, symbolic representations, abbreviations, and one-liners where possible. Omit purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, or comments—only output the pseudocode itself. Make it compact and high-level, even if that means leaving out some details to reduce line count. Follow this numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second timeout.
