Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, **evaluate each snippet independently** to decide if it is unambiguously and fully reproducible—that is, whether its complete logic and specifications guarantee passing *all* unit tests for every valid input, without missing details, contradictions, ambiguity, or reliance on external assumptions.  
Assess the pseudocode rigorously for correctness, completeness, determinism, well-defined inputs/outputs, and clarity of all steps. Assume unit tests cover the full valid input space.  
For each snippet, output exactly one digit: **1** if it can be confidently deemed fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass *all* unit tests, or **0** otherwise.  
Provide the outputs in the exact order of the input snippets, with no extra characters, explanations, whitespace, or deviations—only the sequence of digits corresponding one-to-one to the inputs.  
Base your decision solely on the provided pseudocode text and infer no external knowledge.  
Respond strictly within 5 seconds per batch of snippets.  
No text beyond the digits, no formatting, no commentary—just a clean numeric sequence.
