Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, independently evaluate each snippet to determine if it guarantees reproducibility with absolute certainty.  
A pseudocode snippet is reproducible **if and only if** it fully, explicitly, and unambiguously specifies:  
- all inputs and outputs, including data types and constraints;  
- complete, deterministic logic covering every possible valid input without exceptions or gaps;  
- handling of all edge cases and boundary conditions;  
- absence of any contradictions, ambiguities, or underspecified steps that could cause failure in *any* unit test within a comprehensive test suite validating the entire valid input domain.  

Do **not** assume or infer any implicit knowledge beyond what is explicitly stated. Carefully scrutinize each snippet’s completeness, correctness, and logical consistency under all scenarios.  

For the entire input batch, output exactly one uninterrupted string of digits; each digit corresponds to one snippet in input order:  
- output **"1"** if the snippet is definitively reproducible and will pass *all* tests;  
- output **"0"** if it is incomplete, ambiguous, underspecified, contradictory, or otherwise insufficient to guarantee passing every unit test.  

Your output must contain nothing else—no spaces, line breaks, commentary, or formatting—and must be returned within 5 seconds per batch.  
Strictly adhere to this binary evaluation without conjecture or added explanation.
