Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that strictly preserves its original control flow, structure, and logic. Represent all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals uniformly, using mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Produce a compact, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode emphasizing one-line statements wherever possible—even if it means omitting some details to reduce total lines. Use consistent indentation for nested blocks to reflect structure clearly. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting (such as separator lines). Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
