Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that strictly preserves its original control flow and structure. Express all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals uniformly and simply using mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Prioritize compactness and readability by using one-line statements where practical, even if that means omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, notes, or extra formatting like separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines following this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
