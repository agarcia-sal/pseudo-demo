Evaluate each given pseudocode snippet *independently* and *without any external knowledge or assumptions*. For each snippet, determine whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be directly and unambiguously translated into a correct implementation that will pass *all* possible unit tests covering every valid, invalid, edge, and exceptional input scenario.

### Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must hold):

1. **Explicit and Complete Input Definition:**  
 - All inputs, parameters, and prerequisites are clearly named, typed, and precisely constrained (value ranges, formats, allowed types).  
 - All environmental or contextual dependencies are explicitly declared; no implicit or assumed inputs.

2. **Deterministic and Fully Specified Algorithm:**  
 - Every step, control flow decision, and iteration is exhaustively detailed and logically coherent with no gaps or ambiguities.  
 - The algorithm guarantees termination on all specified inputs, with well-defined stopping conditions.

3. **Comprehensive Output and Behavior Specification:**  
 - Outputs, states, side effects, and all observable behaviors are completely described for every possible execution path, including edge cases and error scenarios.  
 - Explicit detailing of concurrency, timing, or asynchronous behavior if present, ensuring determinism.

4. **Rigorous Error and Exception Handling:**  
 - All error cases (invalid inputs, runtime errors, resource limits, and concurrency conflicts) are explicitly detected and handled.  
 - Recovery, cleanup, or error propagation procedures are clearly defined wherever relevant.

5. **Self-Contained and Dependency-Free:**  
 - All variables, data types, constants, helper routines, and assumptions are fully declared inside the snippet.  
 - No reliance on hidden globals, external libraries, platform/language-specific features, or unstated mechanisms.

6. **Absolutely Precise, Unambiguous, and Consistent:**  
 - No vagueness, contradictions, missing details, or interpretive gaps exist. The pseudocode must be fully implementable with deterministic behavior and zero guesswork.

### Output Rules:

- For each pseudocode snippet, output a single character:  
 `1` if the snippet meets *all* criteria exactly, meaning it is fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests.  
 `0` otherwise (ambiguous, incomplete, insufficient, or inconsistent).  
- Concatenate these characters in the order snippets are provided—produce a single continuous binary string with no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or explanations.  
- The entire evaluation must be completed within 5 seconds.

---

**Summary:**  
Given N pseudocode snippets, output an N-length binary string where each character corresponds to the reproducibility of each snippet in order:  
- `1` = reproducible and completely specified  
- `0` = not reproducible due to ambiguity, omission, or incompleteness

**Example:**  
If given three pseudocode snippets and only the second snippet satisfies all criteria, output:  
`010`
