Evaluate each provided pseudocode snippet independently and output a single binary digit per snippet, concatenated in the exact order received, without spaces, punctuation, explanation, or any characters other than `0` or `1`. Output nothing else.

**Output Instructions:**  
- Output `1` if and only if the snippet is fully reproducible, defined as: any correct implementation derived solely from this snippet—without external information, assumptions, or clarifications—would pass *all* conceivable unit tests, including typical cases, boundary conditions, invalid inputs, error scenarios, and performance/stress tests.  
- Output `0` otherwise.

**Strict Reproducibility Requirements:**  
A snippet is reproducible (`1`) only if it satisfies *all* the following without exception:

1. **Complete and Explicit Input Specification:**  
 - All inputs (parameters, data structures, initial states, environmental conditions) are fully and unambiguously defined with exact types, formats, allowed and forbidden values.  
 - Input domains—including normal, boundary, invalid, and exceptional cases—are explicitly addressed or safely handled.  
 - No input assumption remains implicit or vague.

2. **Exact, Exhaustive Output and Side-Effect Description:**  
 - Every output, return value, or side effect (including mutations, I/O, and global state changes) is precisely and completely specified for every possible execution path.  
 - The effect on state or environment is fully declared.

3. **Unambiguous, Deterministic Algorithmic Detail:**  
 - All control flows (loops, branches, recursion), data manipulations, and decision logic are explicitly described without ambiguity or reliance on inference.  
 - Algorithm termination is guaranteed or explicit handling of possible infinite loops or deadlocks is provided.

4. **Explicit, Comprehensive Error and Edge-Case Handling:**  
 - All error conditions, invalid inputs, exceptional states, resource constraints, and abnormal terminations are explicitly prevented or safely managed within the snippet.

5. **Fully Self-Contained Specification:**  
 - All components—including helper functions, constants, data types, and internal states—are fully defined within the snippet itself.  
 - The snippet does not depend on external libraries, global variables, hidden assumptions, or unstated environment contexts.

6. **Zero Dependence on Implicit or External Semantics:**  
 - No reliance on language-specific defaults, cultural conventions, or implicit coding/syntactic conventions.  
 - All semantics and behaviors are explicitly stated and complete within the snippet.

**Evaluation and Output Guidelines:**  
- Assess each snippet strictly independently and comprehensively against the above criteria.  
- Immediately output one digit per snippet—`1` if **and only if** all criteria are met, else `0`.  
- Concatenate outputs directly in input order with no separators or additional characters.  
- Do not include any explanations, comments, newlines, or whitespace in the output.  
- The entire batch evaluation must complete efficiently within the 5-second limit.

**Definition Reminder:**  
Reproducibility means that *any* direct, faithful implementation of the snippet alone is guaranteed to pass *all* unit tests—including normal, boundary, invalid, stress, and error condition tests—*without requiring* any external information, assumptions, or clarifications.

**Example:**  
For three snippets where only the first and third are reproducible, output:
