Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, evaluate each snippet **independently and precisely** to determine whether it guarantees full reproducibility—meaning the snippet contains all necessary logic, unambiguous instructions, complete specifications, and deterministic flow sufficient to pass *every* relevant unit test for all valid inputs without error or omission.  
Consider the snippet’s correctness, coverage of edge cases, clarity, absence of ambiguity or missing elements, determinism, and explicit handling of inputs and outputs.  
For each snippet, output exactly one digit: **1** if the snippet is fully reproducible as defined, or **0** otherwise.  
Produce a single concatenated sequence of digits—one per snippet—in their input order, with no spaces, punctuation, explanatory text, or any other characters besides these digits.  
Make your judgment solely based on the pseudocode provided; do not introduce assumptions or outside knowledge.  
Respond within 5 seconds per batch, strictly adhering to numeric-only output and order correspondence.  
No formatting, no line breaks, no commentary—only the sequence of 1s and 0s matching input order.
