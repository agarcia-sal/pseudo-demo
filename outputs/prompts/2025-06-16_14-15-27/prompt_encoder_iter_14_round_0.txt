Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow and structure. Represent all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals clearly and uniformly using mostly natural language combined with minimal, standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Produce mostly one-line statements whenever feasible, even if this requires omitting some less critical details to keep the pseudocode compact. Use indentation consistently to show nested blocks but do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or any extra formatting (e.g., separator lines). Output only numbered pseudocode lines in this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
