Translate the given code into succinct, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves the original code’s exact control flow and structure. Express all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals uniformly and simply, using mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Prioritize compactness and readability by using concise one-line statements wherever possible—even if some less critical details are omitted to reduce verbosity. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure. Do not include summaries, explanations, comments, or any extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly in the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
