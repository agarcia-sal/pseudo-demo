Translate the input code into numbered pseudocode lines that strictly preserve the original control flow and structure, uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use predominantly natural language with concise symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep the pseudocode compact, clear, and high-level. Prefer single-line statements wherever possible, even if it means omitting some less critical details to minimize line count. Use consistent indentation to reflect nested blocks. Do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
