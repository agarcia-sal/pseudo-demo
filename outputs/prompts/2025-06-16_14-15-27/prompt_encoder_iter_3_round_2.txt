Translate the given code into compact, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves original control flow and structure, expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals uniformly and simply. Use mostly natural language with standard abbreviations and minimal symbolic notation to produce clear, easy-to-read pseudocode. Prefer concise one-line statements even if this sacrifices some details or omits less critical information, to keep it brief. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or separator lines—only output the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
