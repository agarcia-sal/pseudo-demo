Translate the given code into numbered pseudocode lines that strictly preserve its original control flow and structure, uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals with clear and consistent syntax. Use mostly natural language enriched with concise symbolic notations and standard abbreviations to produce a compact, high-level, and easy-to-read representation. Favor one-line statements wherever feasible to minimize verbosity while retaining essential logic; it is acceptable to omit less critical details if it significantly reduces line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure but do not include any comments, explanations, summaries, or formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
