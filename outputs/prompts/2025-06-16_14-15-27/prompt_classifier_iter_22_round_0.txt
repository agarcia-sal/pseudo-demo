Evaluate each provided pseudocode snippet independently and output one digit per snippet indicating whether it is fully reproducible (1) or not (0) according to the exact criteria below:

**Definition of fully reproducible (output 1):**  
A snippet is reproducible if and only if it meets *all* of the following conditions based solely on the snippet’s explicit content, with no inference or assumptions allowed:

1. **Complete and precise input specification:**  
 • All inputs are explicitly defined in terms of types, formats, value domains, and constraints.  
2. **Complete and precise output specification:**  
 • The output(s) are clearly defined without ambiguity.  
3. **Deterministic, exhaustive logic covering all inputs:**  
 • The logic explicitly handles *every* valid input case, including typical, boundary, and edge cases, with no unaddressed cases or logical gaps.  
 • There is no branching or conditional logic left partially specified or underspecified.  
4. **Explicit error and exception handling:**  
 • Any invalid inputs, error conditions, or exceptions are anticipated and handled explicitly within the snippet itself.  
 • No undefined or unspecified behavior under any input or condition.  
5. **Transparent, deterministic execution flow:**  
 • The flow of execution (loops, conditionals, recursion, etc.) is fully and unambiguously described.  
 • No hidden nondeterminism, randomness, or reliance on external state or side effects.  
6. **Self-contained specification:**  
 • The snippet does not depend on any external rules, definitions, assumptions, implicit knowledge, or context beyond what is explicitly stated.  

**Output:**  
- Output **1** for a snippet only if *all* the above are fully satisfied explicitly and unambiguously.  
- Output **0** if any of the above is missing, ambiguous, incomplete, implicit, or requires assumption or inference.

**Additional requirements:**  
- For multiple snippets provided, output a single concatenated string of digits (1s and 0s) in the exact order the snippets appear.  
- Output only the digits (no spaces, newlines, punctuation, or extra text).  
- Do not produce any explanation, commentary, or formatting of any kind.  
- If uncertain or incomplete, output 0 without hesitation.  
- The entire evaluation per batch must be completed within 5 seconds.

**Summary:**  
Given pseudocode snippets, output a digit string where each digit represents whether the corresponding snippet is guaranteed to pass all unit tests by being fully and explicitly specified (1) or not (0), strictly following the criteria above.
