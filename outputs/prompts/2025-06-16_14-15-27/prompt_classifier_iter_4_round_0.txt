Given the pseudocode input(s), determine **only** whether each pseudocode snippet is fully reproducibleâ€”meaning it will deterministically pass *all* unit tests for every valid input, based solely on its logic, completeness, and unambiguous execution flow.  
Output a single digit per snippet: **1** if reproducible, **0** if not.  
The outputs must appear in the exact input order, one digit per pseudocode snippet, without any additional text, whitespace, or formatting.  
Focus your evaluation exclusively on correctness, logical completeness, determinism, handling of all valid input cases, and clarity sufficient for unambiguous execution. Ignore external dependencies or implementation-specific details.  
Produce your result within 5 seconds per input set, and output only the sequence of digits corresponding to each pseudocode input provided.
