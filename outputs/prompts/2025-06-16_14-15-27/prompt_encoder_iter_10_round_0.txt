Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that exactly preserves its original structure and all control flows, including variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals, expressed uniformly but simply.  
Use mostly natural language with minimal but consistent symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to produce a compact, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode.  
Prefer one-line statements whenever possible, even if this means omitting certain details to keep the pseudocode brief.  
Indent nested blocks consistently to clearly show code structure.  
Do not add any explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines—output only the numbered pseudocode lines in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
