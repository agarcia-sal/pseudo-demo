Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output a single digit—**1** if the snippet is fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests, or **0** if not—based solely on the criteria below. Output a concatenated string of digits corresponding exactly in order to the snippets given, with no spaces, punctuation, explanation, or any other characters.

**Definition of fully reproducible (output = 1):**  
A snippet is reproducible if and only if ALL the following conditions are fully and explicitly met within the snippet itself, without any ambiguity, assumption, or external knowledge:

1. **Complete input specification:**  
 • Every input variable, parameter, or data structure is explicitly defined with precise types, valid ranges, formats, and constraints.  
 • No input is implied, partial, missing, or underspecified.  

2. **Clear and exact output definition:**  
 • Outputs are unambiguously defined with explicit types, formats, and direct correspondence to inputs.  
 • Output expectations cover all problem requirements precisely.  

3. **Deterministic and exhaustive logic:**  
 • Algorithmic steps completely cover all cases including normal, boundary, edge, and error inputs.  
 • All control flows (conditionals, loops, recursion) are fully described with no gaps, vague conditions, or undefined pathways.  
 • No behaviors are left implicit, vague, or dependent on inference.  

4. **Explicit error and exception handling:**  
 • All invalid inputs, exceptions, and error scenarios are proactively anticipated and explicitly handled within the snippet.  
 • No undefined or silent failure modes.  

5. **Self-contained, environment-independent execution:**  
 • The logic and output do not rely on any external states, contexts, side-effects, randomness, or hidden dependencies.  
 • All variables, states, and intermediate data are fully defined and managed inside the snippet.  

6. **No implicit assumptions or dependencies:**  
 • The snippet requires no outside knowledge, conventions, documentation, or supplementary information to understand or reproduce.  
 • The snippet stands alone as complete and sufficient to be implemented and tested successfully.  

**Operational instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output one digit: **1** if and only if all above criteria are met; otherwise output **0**.  
- Concatenate all digits in the exact order the snippets are provided, without spaces, commas, or any other characters.  
- Do not output explanations, comments, line breaks, or whitespace.  
- If any ambiguity, incompleteness, or uncertainty exists, output **0** for that snippet.  
- Complete all determinations within 5 seconds.  

**In summary:**  
Given one or more pseudocode snippets, return an unbroken string of digits where each digit corresponds to one snippet and indicates whether it is unambiguously and thoroughly specified to guarantee reproducibility and passing all unit tests (**1**), or not (**0**).
