Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that preserves its original structure exactly and uniformly expresses all control flows, variable assignments, function calls, and loops in a simple, natural language style. Use mostly natural language enhanced with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to maximize high-level readability and compactness. Prefer one-liner statements wherever possible, even if that means omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure, but avoid any extra formatting such as separator lines or comments. Output only the pseudocode itself, without any explanations, summaries, or clarifications. Number each line as shown:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Follow this minimalistic style exactly. For example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
