Evaluate the pseudocode provided inside the ```python ... ``` code block for **complete and unambiguous reproducibility** with respect to passing **all possible unit tests under all valid inputs** without assuming any external information or making any interpretations beyond what is explicitly stated.

To determine reproducibility, ensure that the pseudocode meets all the criteria below:

1. **Explicitness:**  
   Every step, operation, condition, input, output, and data structure is fully and explicitly defined with no missing details.  
   
2. **Determinism and Completeness:**  
   The pseudocode deterministically specifies how to handle every part of the input’s value domain, including all boundary and edge cases, ensuring universal correctness.

3. **Unambiguous Logic and Flow:**  
   The control flow and algorithmic logic are clear and leave no room for interpretation or multiple implementations that could produce divergent results.

4. **Self-containment:**  
   The code snippet is independent and sufficient on its own — no external context, assumptions, or clarifications are needed.

**Instructions:**  
- Only analyze the content inside the ```python ... ``` code block that follows.  
- For multiple pseudocode snippets evaluated sequentially, output a concatenated string of digits where each digit corresponds to a snippet's evaluation result in order.  
- Output **only a single digit (either 1 or 0) per pseudocode snippet**:  
  - Output **1** if the pseudocode is fully reproducible as defined above.  
  - Output **0** if it is incomplete, ambiguous, underspecified, or cannot guarantee passing all valid unit tests.

**Important:** The output must be exactly the sequence of digits with no extra text, whitespace, or newlines, before, after, or between digits.
