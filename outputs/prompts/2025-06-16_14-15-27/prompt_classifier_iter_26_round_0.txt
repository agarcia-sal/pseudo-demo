Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output exactly one digit per snippet:

**Output:**  
- **1** if the snippet is fully and rigorously reproducible: containing all explicit, unambiguous, and complete information needed to guarantee it will pass all unit tests under every possible scenario without error.  
- **0** if the snippet lacks any necessary detail, clarity, completeness, or deterministic behavior required to ensure perfect reproducibility.

Make your judgment solely using the following strict reproducibility requirements, applying them literally and without inference or external assumptions:

1. **Complete and explicit input specification:**  
 - Every input variable, parameter, or data structure is precisely defined with types, valid ranges, allowed formats, units, and all constraints stated explicitly.  
 - No inputs may be implied, partial, ambiguous, or omitted.

2. **Exact and comprehensive output description:**  
 - Outputs are fully defined with clear type, format, and precise mapping for every input scenario.  
 - The output specification accounts for all relevant edge cases and expected results with no gaps.

3. **Deterministic, fully detailed algorithmic logic:**  
 - All steps (initialization, computation, iteration, conditionals, recursion, state changes) are described clearly and exhaustively.  
 - Every input condition—including normal, boundary, edge, invalid, and exceptional cases—is explicitly handled with no undefined or implicit assumptions.  
 - No gaps, omissions, ambiguous logic, or missing branches are allowed.

4. **Explicit handling of errors, exceptions, and edge cases:**  
 - All invalid inputs, error conditions, exceptions, and abnormal scenarios are anticipated and handled precisely within the snippet.  
 - The snippet prevents silent failures, crashes, infinite loops, deadlocks, or undefined behavior.

5. **Self-contained and environment-independent:**  
 - The snippet requires no external state, prior context, hidden variables, randomness, or side effects beyond what is described.  
 - All variables and intermediates are declared and managed internally; no dependencies on external code, libraries, or global context.

6. **No hidden assumptions or external knowledge:**  
 - The snippet is sufficient on its own with no reliance on conventions, undocumented protocols, external standards, or background information outside the snippet.  
 - All necessary details to implement and test are explicitly provided.

**Operational instructions:**  
- For each snippet received in sequence, output a single character:  
 - **"1"** if and only if it meets *all* of the above criteria completely and unambiguously.  
 - Otherwise, output **"0"**.  
- Concatenate these digits into one continuous string matching the exact input order of snippets.  
- Output no spaces, punctuation, commentary, or formatting—only the digit string.  
- If there is *any* ambiguity, missing detail, or uncertainty about full reproducibility, output **0** for that snippet.  
- Respond within 5 seconds per input batch.  

**Summary:**  
Given one or more pseudocode snippets, produce a concise string where each digit corresponds exactly to each snippet’s order and indicates whether it is guaranteed reproducible (1) or not (0) for passing all unit tests, with no additional output or explanation.
