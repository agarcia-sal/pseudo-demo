Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output exactly one digit per snippet:  
**1** if the snippet is rigorously and unambiguously reproducible—meaning it contains all necessary and sufficient explicit details to guarantee that it will pass every unit test without fail, or **0** if it falls short.

Your determination must be based solely on the following comprehensive reproducibility criteria, applied strictly and literally without any assumptions or external knowledge:

1. **Explicit complete input specification:**  
 - Every input variable, parameter, or data structure is fully described with exact types, all valid ranges, formats, units, and constraints stated clearly.  
 - No input is implied, incomplete, ambiguous, or missing.

2. **Precise and exhaustive output definition:**  
 - Outputs are specified unambiguously with explicit type, format, and exact mapping from inputs to outputs.  
 - The output specification thoroughly covers all aspects expected by the problem.

3. **Fully deterministic, comprehensive algorithmic logic:**  
 - All processing steps, including initializations, calculations, iterations, conditionals, and recursion, are completely and explicitly described.  
 - Every possible input scenario, including typical, boundary, edge, and error cases, is handled without any undefined or implicit behaviors.  
 - Logic flow is fully fleshed out with no gaps, unclear conditions, or missing branches.

4. **Explicit error and exception management:**  
 - All invalid inputs and exceptional scenarios are proactively anticipated and unambiguously handled within the snippet.  
 - No possibility of silent failures, crashes, infinite loops, or undefined states.

5. **Self-contained and environment-agnostic:**  
 - The snippet stands alone with no dependencies on external state, hidden context, random values, global variables, or side effects.  
 - All variables and intermediate data are fully declared and handled internally.

6. **No hidden assumptions or external requirements:**  
 - The snippet does not rely on implicit conventions, undocumented standards, external libraries, or background knowledge.  
 - It is fully sufficient and ready to be directly implemented and tested without further clarification.

**Operational instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet you receive in order, output a single digit: **1** if and only if all criteria above are met explicitly and completely; otherwise output **0**.  
- Concatenate the digits for all snippets into one continuous string, preserving the input order, with no spaces, commas, extra characters, or line breaks.  
- Do not output any explanations, commentary, or formatting—only the digit string.  
- If any ambiguity, vagueness, incompleteness, or doubt exists about reproducibility for a snippet, output **0** for that snippet.  
- Make all decisions within 5 seconds.

**In short:**  
Given one or more pseudocode snippets, return a compact string of digits where each digit corresponds exactly to the snippet’s order and confidently indicates if it is reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests (**1**) or not (**0**), with no other output.
