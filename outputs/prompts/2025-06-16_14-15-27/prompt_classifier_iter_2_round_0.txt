Given one or more pieces of pseudocode as input, determine for each whether it is unequivocally reproducible—that is, guaranteed to pass *all* unit tests under every valid input scenario based solely on its logical correctness, completeness, determinism, and absence of ambiguity or missing steps.  
For each pseudocode, output exactly one digit: **1** if it is reproducible, or **0** if it is not.  
Outputs must appear in the exact order of the pseudocode inputs received, with no additional text, formatting, explanation, or spacing.  
Assess only the code’s intrinsic ability to pass all test cases correctly and consistently within a 5-second evaluation window.  
Do not include any reasoning or commentary—only the sequence of digits corresponding precisely to the input order.
