Translate the given code into compact, clear pseudocode that strictly preserves the original code’s control flow and structure by uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly natural language enriched with succinct symbolic notations and standard abbreviations to produce a high-level, easy-to-read outline. Prefer concise one-line statements wherever possible—even if this means omitting less critical details. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure but do not include any comments, explanations, or separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines, following exactly this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
