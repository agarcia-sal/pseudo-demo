Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow, structure, and all key operations—variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals—expressing them uniformly and simply. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and common abbreviations, aiming for compactness and readability. Prefer one-line statements whenever possible, even at the cost of omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to show structure. Omit any comments, explanations, summaries, or separator lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly as in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
