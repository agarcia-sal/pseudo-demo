Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves its original structure and control flow, including all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use natural language mixed with common symbolic notations and standard abbreviations to keep the pseudocode compact and easy to read. Prefer single-line statements whenever possible—even if that means omitting some details—to minimize line count. Indent nested blocks to reflect structure clearly but do not add any comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting (such as separator lines). Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
