Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently for full reproducibility, defined as guaranteed passing of all conceivable unit tests on the entire valid input domain based solely on the snippet’s explicit content.

For each snippet, output exactly one digit, concatenated in order:  
- Output **1** if the snippet is unmistakably and exhaustively specified such that it:  
 • Defines all inputs (types, formats, constraints, valid ranges) and outputs with complete precision and without ambiguity.  
 • Contains fully deterministic, complete logic covering every valid input case including typical, boundary, and edge cases explicitly, with no gaps or unhandled scenarios.  
 • Explicitly anticipates and correctly handles all errors, exceptions, invalid inputs, and edge conditions within the snippet, preventing undefined or ambiguous behavior.  
 • Exhibits clear, unambiguous, and deterministic execution flow, guaranteeing identical results for identical inputs under all conditions, with no hidden nondeterminism or contradictions.  
 • Is entirely self-contained: it does not depend on any implicit rules, external definitions, or assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated within the snippet.  

- Output **0** if the snippet fails any of the above criteria, contains ambiguity, omissions, or requires inference or implicit assumptions.

**Requirements:**  
- Do not infer, assume, or fill in missing information. Any uncertainty or incompleteness mandates a 0.  
- For multiple snippets, output a single string of digits (1s and 0s) corresponding to the order of input snippets, with no spaces, separators, or extra characters.  
- Output only digits, nothing else.  
- Response time must not exceed 5 seconds per batch.

**Summary:** Given each pseudocode snippet as input, produce a digit string, each digit representing whether the snippet is fully reproducible (1) or not (0), strictly as defined above. No commentary, formatting, or additional output.
