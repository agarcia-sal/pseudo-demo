Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow, structure, and logic. Express all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals uniformly using simple, mostly natural language combined with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Prioritize compactness and readability: use one-liners whenever possible, allowing omission of less critical details if it reduces line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to show structure but do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or decorative formatting. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
