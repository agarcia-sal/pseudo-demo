Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow and structure, uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly natural language enhanced with brief symbolic notations and common abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to read. Prefer single-line statements for simple operations and combine conditions or short loops where possible, even if this means omitting less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect hierarchy. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or any extra formatting like separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines, exactly following this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
