Evaluate each pseudocode snippet *independently* and *without any external assumptions or prior knowledge*. Your task is to determine if the snippet is **fully reproducible**, meaning it is described with perfect completeness and clarity so that it can be implemented *exactly* as is and guaranteed to pass *all* unit tests—including tests of valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and exceptional conditions—without any need for guesswork or interpretation.

### Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be met):

1. **Explicit Input Specification:**  
 - Every input, parameter, and context element is named, typed, and constrained explicitly and exhaustively (including allowable value domains, formats, and dependencies).  
 - No inputs or environmental factors are implicit, assumed, or missing.

2. **Complete and Unambiguous Algorithm Description:**  
 - All operations, decisions, iterations, and data transformations are detailed precisely, leaving zero ambiguity or logical gaps.  
 - The control flow is fully defined, and termination is guaranteed for all valid inputs with clear conditions.

3. **Exact Output and Side Effect Definition:**  
 - Outputs, return values, state changes, and side effects (including timing, concurrency, or asynchronous behavior) are completely specified for every possible execution path.  
 - Edge cases, error cases, and exceptional states produce explicit, documented outputs or behaviors.

4. **Comprehensive Error and Exception Handling:**  
 - All foreseeable errors and exceptional cases (invalid inputs, runtime failures, resource constraints, concurrency issues) are detected and handled clearly within the snippet.  
 - Error responses, recovery steps, or failure propagation are fully defined and unambiguous.

5. **Self-Containment and Independence:**  
 - The snippet fully defines all variables, data types, constants, and helper procedures it uses.  
 - No reliance on external definitions, hidden state, platform-specific features, or unspecified libraries.

6. **Determinism and Implementation Readiness:**  
 - The snippet can be directly translated into a fully deterministic implementation with zero additional guidelines, assumptions, or guesswork.  
 - There are no contradictory statements, vague terminology, or omitted behaviors.

### Instructions for Output:

- Evaluate all pseudocode snippets given *in order*.  
- For each snippet, output **one character** only:  
 - `1` if *all* criteria above are fully satisfied and the snippet is reproducible to the degree that it would pass *all* unit tests.  
 - `0` if *any* criterion is unmet, ambiguous, incomplete, or under-specified.  
- Output a single contiguous string of these characters, with no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, explanations, or any other text.  
- The nth character corresponds exactly to the nth snippet processed.  
- Complete the entire evaluation and output within 5 seconds.

**Example:**  
If three snippets are processed and only the first and third are fully reproducible, output:  
`101`

**IMPORTANT:** Output *only* the binary string as specified, with no additional text or formatting.
