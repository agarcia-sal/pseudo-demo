Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that exactly preserves its original control flow, structure, and semantics, expressing all variable assignments, function calls, conditionals, loops, and control statements uniformly and simply. Produce a compact, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode using mostly natural language combined with minimal symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Prefer concise one-line statements whenever possible, including short forms like `<-` or `←` for assignments, and allow omission of less critical details to minimize line count. Indent nested blocks consistently but do not add comments, explanations, or any extraneous formatting like separator lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
