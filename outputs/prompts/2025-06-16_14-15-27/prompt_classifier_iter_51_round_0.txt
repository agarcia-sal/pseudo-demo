Evaluate each pseudocode snippet *exclusively* based on its exact provided text, without applying external knowledge, assumptions, or inferred intent. Your task is to determine if the snippet is **unconditionally reproducible**, meaning it contains a *complete, deterministic, and unambiguous* algorithmic specification that enables a developer to produce an implementation guaranteed to pass *all* unit tests over *all* valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and runtime conditions.

### Mandatory Criteria for Reproducibility (all must be explicitly and fully satisfied):

1. **Explicit and Complete Inputs**  
 - All inputs and parameters are fully defined: names, types, allowed value ranges or formats, initial states.  
 - Any environmental or context dependencies influencing inputs or execution must be clearly specified without gaps or ambiguity.

2. **Comprehensive, Deterministic Algorithm Definition**  
 - The complete procedure is precisely described step-by-step, including control flow (conditionals, loops, recursion), data manipulations, state transitions, and their exact order.  
 - Termination conditions are clearly defined and guaranteed to prevent infinite or indeterminate execution, for every input scenario.

3. **Precise and Exhaustive Outputs and Effects**  
 - All return values, outputs, state changes, and side effects are explicitly described for every execution path, including normal, boundary, error, and exceptional cases.  
 - Any concurrent, asynchronous, or timing-dependent behavior must be fully delineated.

4. **Thorough Error and Exception Management**  
 - The snippet explicitly defines how to handle invalid inputs, runtime errors, exceptions, resource management, and concurrency hazards (deadlocks, race conditions).  
 - All necessary cleanup, rollback, or recovery operations are fully specified.

5. **Self-Contained Specification with No Implicit Dependencies**  
 - All auxiliary functions, data structures, constants, and system/environment setups used in the pseudocode are completely defined or described within the snippet.  
 - No reliance on unspecified external libraries, implicit language features, global states, or assumptions is allowed.

6. **Absolute Clarity and Zero Ambiguity**  
 - The pseudocode contains no vague, incomplete, or ambiguous statements; no missing steps or unstated assumptions remain.  
 - Every element is clearly translatable into a fully executable implementation *without any need for guesswork or interpretation*.

### Processing Instructions:

- Assess each snippet *only* based on its text against **all** criteria above. Do **not** invent or infer missing details.  
- If a snippet fails *any* one criterion, it is *not* reproducible.  
- For each snippet, output exactly one digit in sequence:  
 `1` if the snippet is fully reproducible (meets all criteria);  
 `0` if it does not.  
- Output a single continuous string of these digits for all input snippets in their given order, with no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or extra characters.  
- Output **only** this string. No explanations, verbatim reiterations, or commentary.  
- The evaluation must complete efficiently and within the given time limits.

---

**Summary:**  
Your output is a binary string representing the reproducibility of each pseudocode snippet:  
- `1` = snippet is complete, unambiguous, and guaranteed reproducible under all test conditions  
- `0` = snippet is incomplete, ambiguous, or insufficient in any way

**Example:**  
For three pseudocode snippets where only the first and last are reproducible, output:  
`101`
