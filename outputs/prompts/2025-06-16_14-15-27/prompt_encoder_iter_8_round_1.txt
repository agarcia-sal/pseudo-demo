Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves its original structure and control flow, uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals in simple, natural language mixed with minimal symbolic notation. Use mostly one-line statements and standard programming abbreviations whenever possible to keep the pseudocode compact and easy to read. You may omit less critical details if doing so reduces length and complexity. Indent nested blocks consistently to show hierarchy, but do not include any comments, explanations, summaries, or decorative separators. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
