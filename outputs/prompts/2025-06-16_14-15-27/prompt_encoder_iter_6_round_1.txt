Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves its original control flow and structure, uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals in a simple and consistent manner. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep the pseudocode compact, readable, and easy to follow. Prefer single-line statements and symbolic shorthand whenever possible, even if this means omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks clearly but avoid any comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only numbered lines in this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
