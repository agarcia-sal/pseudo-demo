Evaluate the pseudocode provided inside the ```python ... ``` code block for **absolute reproducibility** defined as follows:

- The pseudocode is fully **specification-complete**, meaning it explicitly and unambiguously defines every operation, variable, input domain, condition, decision branch, iteration, and edge case necessary to correctly and deterministically solve the problem.
- It contains no gaps, ambiguities, or missing details that would hinder direct implementation without any assumptions or external clarifications.
- It is entirely **self-sufficient**â€”all required information to pass **all possible unit tests** (including edge and corner cases) is included in the given code block alone.
- The logic must be **correct and robust** under all valid inputs; if any potential input scenario or behavior is undefined or underspecified, yield `0`.
- No dependencies on outside context, unspecified constraints, or implicit knowledge beyond what is explicitly presented.

Your task is to **output a single digit** per pseudocode input precisely as follows:

- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode can be implemented exactly as given and pass every relevant unit test without external information.
- Output `0` otherwise.

**No extra explanation, formatting, comments, or output is allowed.**  
Outputs must strictly correspond, in order, to the pseudocode inputs you receive.

Example input format:
```
python
# pseudocode here
```

Evaluate each such block independently and output only `1` or `0`.

This prompt prioritizes rigorous, explicit criteria with emphasis on completeness, determinism, and independence, ensuring the best possible accuracy in distinguishing reproducible pseudocode from incomplete or ambiguous ones.
