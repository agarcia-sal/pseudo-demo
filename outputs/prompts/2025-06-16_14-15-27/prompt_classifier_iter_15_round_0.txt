Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, **analyze each snippet independently and thoroughly** to determine if it is fully reproducible.  
A reproducible snippet must explicitly and unambiguously specify all logic, inputs, outputs, edge cases, and have no contradictions or gaps that would prevent it from passing *all* unit tests spanning the entire valid input domain.  
Check that the pseudocode is complete, deterministic, logically consistent, and precisely defines how results are computed under every relevant scenario.  
Assume the unit tests are comprehensive and cover all valid inputs.  
For each snippet, output exactly one digit: **1** if it reliably guarantees passing all unit tests for every valid input based on the pseudocode alone, or **0** if it is incomplete, ambiguous, contradictory, or underspecified in any way.  
Output a single uninterrupted string of digits corresponding one-to-one and in order with the inputs, with no spaces, line breaks, commentary, or formatting.  
Do not infer any knowledge beyond what is explicitly stated in the pseudocode.  
Your output must be delivered within 5 seconds per batch of snippets and strictly contain nothing but the sequence of digits.
