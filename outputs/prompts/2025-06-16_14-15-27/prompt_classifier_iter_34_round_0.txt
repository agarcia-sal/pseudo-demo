Evaluate each given pseudocode snippet independently and output a single binary digit for each—concatenated exactly in the order received, with no spaces, punctuation, explanations, or any characters other than digits.

**Output Specification:**  
- Output **1** if and only if the snippet fulfills *all* criteria for full reproducibility, such that:  
 • Every input and output (including all parameters, data structures, return values, and side effects) is exhaustively and explicitly specified with precise types, formats, valid/invalid domains, initial and final states, and covers all normal, edge, and exceptional inputs.  
 • All algorithmic steps—control flow (branches, loops, recursion), data transformations, and termination conditions—are completely detailed, deterministic, and free from ambiguity, omissions, or implicit assumptions.  
 • Every possible error scenario, boundary case, infinite loop risk, deadlock, exception, and abnormal termination is explicitly prevented, handled, or accounted for, leaving no unresolved or undefined behavior.  
 • The snippet is fully self-contained, including *all* necessary definitions for helper functions, constants, data structures, and internal state management, without relying on external code, environment, globals, or unstated domain knowledge.  
 • No reliance on implicit conventions, language-specific semantics, or cultural/contextual assumptions exists; every semantic detail must be clearly and unambiguously encoded within the snippet itself.  

- Output **0** otherwise.

**Assessment criteria (all must be satisfied):**

1. **Complete and Precise Input Description:** Every input aspect—name, type, allowed values, format, initial conditions—is explicitly enumerated, covering valid, invalid, edge cases, and exceptions; no detail is implicit or missing.

2. **Explicit Output and State Postconditions:** All outputs, return values, and changes to state or side effects are clearly and fully specified for every execution path.

3. **Fully Deterministic and Exhaustive Procedure Definition:** The pseudocode specifies exact control flow and data manipulations, with no ambiguity, ensuring guaranteed termination or explicit handling of nontermination.

4. **Comprehensive Error and Anomaly Coverage:** Every error possibility, invalid input scenario, edge case, infinite loop or deadlock risk, and exception path is explicitly addressed with safe handling or documented impossibility.

5. **Complete Self-Containment:** The snippet includes all auxiliary definitions and does not depend on implicit context, external libraries, global variables, runtime assumptions, or domain expertise.

6. **No Hidden or Implicit Knowledge:** All semantics, conventions, and assumptions are fully and explicitly declared within the snippet; the snippet stands alone without requiring any external or cultural context.

**Instructions:**  
- Analyze each snippet independently and apply all criteria rigorously and deterministically.  
- Output one digit per snippet: `1` if all criteria are met; `0` otherwise.  
- Concatenate these digits in the exact order of input snippets with no separators or extra characters.  
- Produce no output other than these digits: no explanations, formatting, or whitespace.  
- Adhere to a strict time limit of 5 seconds per batch for evaluation.

**Definition of Reproducibility:**  
A snippet is reproducible only if *any* direct implementation based solely on it can pass *all* conceivable unit tests—including typical cases, boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and stress scenarios—without requiring additional information or assumptions.

---

**Example:**  
Given three pseudocode snippets, if only the first and last pass this standard completely, output:  
`101`

**NOTE:** This evaluation demands absolute explicitness and exhaustiveness to guarantee reproducibility under rigorous testing.
