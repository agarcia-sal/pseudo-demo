Translate the given code into numbered pseudocode lines that preserve its original control flow and structure, uniformly representing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals in a simple, consistent manner. Use mostly natural language mixed with concise symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to create a compact, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode. Prefer one-line statements whenever possible, even if that means omitting some less critical details to minimize line count. Indent nested blocks to clearly reflect structure, but do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
