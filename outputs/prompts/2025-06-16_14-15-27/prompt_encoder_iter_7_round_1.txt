Translate the given code into clear, concise, and numbered pseudocode lines that strictly preserve the original control flow and logical structure. Express all variable declarations, assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals uniformly and simply. Favor mostly natural language with minimal and standard symbolic notation and abbreviations to keep the pseudocode compact, high-level, and easy to read. Use one-liners wherever possible, even if it means omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to show structure but omit comments, explanations, summaries, or any extra formatting (such as separator lines). Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
