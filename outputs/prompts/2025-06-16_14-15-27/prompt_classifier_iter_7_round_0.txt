Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, independently analyze each snippet to determine if it is **fully reproducible**—meaning its logic, flow, and definitions are complete, unambiguous, and precise enough to guarantee passing *all* unit tests on every valid input without reliance on external assumptions, omissions, or randomness.  
Evaluate each snippet based strictly on:  
- **Correctness:** Does the logic implement the intended functionality unerringly?  
- **Completeness:** Are all cases, inputs, and edge conditions covered and handled?  
- **Determinism:** Is the output always uniquely defined and stable for the same input?  
- **Clarity:** Is the pseudocode expressed clearly enough to be implemented exactly as intended, without gaps or contradictions?  

For each snippet, output exactly one character:  
- **1** if it meets all these reproducibility criteria and thus will pass all unit tests,  
- **0** if it fails any criteria or leaves ambiguity or incompleteness that could cause test failures.  

Outputs must be concatenated in strict input order, with no delimiters, spaces, line breaks, or any other characters—no explanations, no formatting, no commentary, nothing beyond the raw digits.  

Base your decisions solely on the given pseudocode text, ignoring any external context or information. Respond strictly within 5 seconds per batch of snippets.
