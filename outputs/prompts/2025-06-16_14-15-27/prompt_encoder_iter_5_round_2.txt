Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow and structure, including all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly natural language combined with concise symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to produce a compact, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode. Prefer single-line statements whenever possible, allowing omission of some less critical details to minimize line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect logic and hierarchy, but do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or any formatting such as separator lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines in this style exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
