Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that strictly preserves its original control flow and structure, uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly natural language combined with simple symbolic notation and common abbreviations to produce a compact, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode. Aim for one-line statements whenever feasible, even if that requires omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect control structure, but do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines.

Output only numbered pseudocode lines in this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
