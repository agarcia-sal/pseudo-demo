Evaluate each pseudocode snippet *independently* and *using only the information contained within that snippet*, with no external assumptions or inferred context. For each snippet, determine if it is **fully reproducible** in the sense that it can be implemented *exactly as written*, without ambiguity, missing details, or logical gaps, such that it will *unfailingly pass all possible unit tests*—including standard, edge, invalid, and exceptional cases.

---

### Definitive Full Reproducibility Checklist (all conditions must be met):

1. **Complete and Explicit Inputs:**  
 - All input parameters and variables are fully declared with precise and unambiguous names.  
 - Data types, valid ranges, formats, and constraints are fully specified.  
 - No hidden, implicit, or undefined inputs or environments are referenced.

2. **Fully Specified Algorithm and Flow:**  
 - Every operation, condition, branching, loop, and recursion is explicitly and unambiguously defined, covering *all* possible input cases.  
 - No logical holes, unspecified behavior, or incomplete branches exist.  
 - Termination conditions and guarantees are clearly stated for *all* valid inputs.

3. **Exhaustive Output and Side Effect Definition:**  
 - Outputs are fully described for every execution path, including normal, edge, error, and special cases.  
 - All side effects (modifications, state changes) are explicitly detailed.  
 - If concurrency or non-determinism are involved, their behavior and resolution are precisely and fully defined to ensure determinism.

4. **Explicit and Complete Error Handling:**  
 - Every potential error or exceptional condition (invalid input, runtime faults, environment constraints) is anticipated and explicitly handled with clear resolution or propagation logic.  
 - No silent failures, implicit defaults, or undefined error states are allowed.

5. **Self-Containment without External Dependencies:**  
 - All variables, constants, helper routines, and assumptions are included explicitly within the snippet.  
 - The pseudocode contains no calls, references, or requirements to external libraries, APIs, global states, or language/platform specifics.  
 - No reliance on environment or context outside what is presented.

6. **Precision, Clarity, and Unambiguity:**  
 - Language and notation are exact, leaving no room for multiple valid interpretations.  
 - No vague expressions, contradictory statements, or omissions exist.  
 - The snippet can be converted directly into a deterministic program without any guesswork or additional inference.

### Response Instructions:

- Given *N* pseudocode snippets in the order presented, output a single binary string of length *N*.  
- For each snippet: output `1` if the snippet meets *all* above criteria and will *definitely* pass all unit tests in every conceivable input and scenario.  
- Output `0` otherwise (if any ambiguity, incompleteness, missing detail, or potential failure exists).  
- Output *only* the binary string—no spaces, line breaks, explanation, or additional text.  
- The *i*th character corresponds exactly to the *i*th snippet evaluated.  
- Complete the evaluation and output within 5 seconds.

**Example:**  
For three snippets where only the first and third are fully reproducible, output:  
`101`

**Strict reminder:**  
Output *only* the binary string, nothing else.
