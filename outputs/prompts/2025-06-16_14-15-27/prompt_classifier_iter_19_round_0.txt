Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, evaluate each snippet independently and with absolute rigor to determine if it is fully reproducible—that is, guaranteed to pass **all** possible unit tests across the **entire valid input domain**—based solely on its explicit content, without any external context or assumptions.

Output a single digit per snippet:  
- **1** if the snippet meets every reproducibility requirement below with no ambiguity or omission, and  
- **0** otherwise.

The **reproducibility** criteria (all must be explicitly satisfied within the snippet itself) are:

1. **Complete and precise specification of inputs, outputs, and all variables:** Types, formats, valid ranges, and constraints are exhaustively and unambiguously defined, ensuring no uncertainty.

2. **Exhaustive, deterministic handling of the entire valid input space:** Every valid input case—normal, boundary, and edge—is covered explicitly by the logic, with no partial, missing, or implicit cases.

3. **Explicit and comprehensive management of all errors, exceptions, and edge conditions:** All abnormal or exceptional scenarios are foreseen and handled within the pseudocode, preventing undefined or inconsistent states.

4. **Unambiguous, consistent operational semantics and control flow:** Instructions and state changes are clearly defined such that identical inputs always produce exactly the same output, with no contradictions or vague instructions.

5. **Complete self-containment:** The snippet alone suffices to guarantee reproducibility with no reliance on outside knowledge, unstated rules, or implicit assumptions.

For multiple snippets, output a **continuous string of '1' and '0' digits** matching the order in which the snippets are provided. Do **not** output anything else: no explanations, comments, whitespace, or delimiters.

Do **not** infer or guess any missing information. Apply strict binary classification: if any criterion is even slightly unmet or ambiguous, output **0** for that snippet.

Respond within 5 seconds per batch of inputs.

**Remember:** Output only the reproducibility digits corresponding in order to the given pseudocode snippets, nothing else.
