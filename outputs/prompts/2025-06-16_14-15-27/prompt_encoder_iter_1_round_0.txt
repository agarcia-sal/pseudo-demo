Translate the given code to clear, concise pseudocode that strictly preserves its original control flow and structure. Uniformly express all variable declarations, assignments, function calls, conditionals, loops, and returns using mostly natural language combined with minimal symbolic notation and common abbreviations to maximize high-level readability and brevity. Favor compact one-liner statements, even if some less critical details must be omitted to minimize lines. Consistently indent nested blocks to reflect code structure precisely. Do not add explanations, summaries, comments, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines starting at 1, following this exact style and format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
