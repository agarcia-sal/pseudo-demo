Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow and structure, uniformly expressing all control statements, variable assignments, function calls, and loops. Use primarily natural language combined with common abbreviations and symbolic notation where it leads to more compact, clear one-liners. Prefer single-line combined syntax (e.g., loop conditions with increment or conditional assignments) to reduce line count, but maintain consistent indentation that clearly reflects code block nesting. Omissions of less critical details are allowed to keep pseudocode succinct and readable. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or any extra formatting such as separator lines. Number each output line sequentially in this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
