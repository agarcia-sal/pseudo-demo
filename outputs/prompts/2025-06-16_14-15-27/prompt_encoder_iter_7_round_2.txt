Translate the given code into clear, compact pseudocode that strictly preserves its original control flow, structure, and logic. Express all variable assignments, function calls, conditionals, and loops in a uniform and simple style using mostly natural language enriched with concise symbolic notations and standard abbreviations. Prioritize readability with consistent indentation for nested blocks but favor one-liner statements whenever possible—even if that means omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
