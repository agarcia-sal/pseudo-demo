Translate the given code into a numbered list of concise pseudocode statements that exactly preserve its original control flow and structure. Express all variable assignments, function calls, conditionals, loops, and data manipulations uniformly using mostly natural language with occasional minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Produce compact, high-level pseudocode by preferring single-line statements wherever possible—even if this requires omitting some less critical details to reduce length. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect code hierarchy. Do not add any explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
