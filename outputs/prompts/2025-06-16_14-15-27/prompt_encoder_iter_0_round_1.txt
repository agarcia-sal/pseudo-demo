Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that preserves the original structure and uniformly represents all control flows, variable assignments, function calls, and loops. Use natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations to maximize readability and compactness. Favor one-liners and high-level expressions, even if some details are omitted to reduce length. Do not add any explanations, summaries, notes, or comments—output only the pseudocode itself. Format your output as numbered lines, following this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Maintain structural clarity (e.g., indent nested blocks) but avoid separator lines or extra formatting. The pseudocode should be easy to follow, uniformly phrased, and minimalistic. For example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
