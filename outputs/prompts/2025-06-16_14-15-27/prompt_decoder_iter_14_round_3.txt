Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code that meets these strict requirements:

- Read all inputs strictly using `input()` with no prompt strings or guidance messages.
- Follow typical competitive programming input formats, handling multiple test cases or varying input structures gracefully.
- Do NOT print any extra text, separators, or debug information; output only the results exactly as specified by the pseudocode logic.
- Use Python standard libraries or built-ins liberally to write concise, optimized, and Pythonic code.
- Prioritize code clarity, maintainability, and performance so it reliably executes within a 5-second time limit on large inputs.
- Avoid any assumptions about input besides what is logically implied by the pseudocode; handle edge cases robustly.
- Enclose the entire final solution in a single python code block with exactly this syntax and no extra text before or after:

```python
# Your finalized Python code translated from pseudocode
```

Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text outside the code block.
