Translate the given code into concise, compact pseudocode that faithfully preserves its original structure and control flow, including variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals, uniformly expressed and easy to read. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep pseudocode high-level and brief. Prefer single-line statements whenever possible, even if that requires omitting less critical details to reduce verbosity. Indent consistently to show nesting but do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or formatting lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines as in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
