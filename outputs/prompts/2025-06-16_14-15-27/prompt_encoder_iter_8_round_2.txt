Translate the given code into concise, compact pseudocode that exactly preserves its control flow and structure, uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly natural language enriched with minimal, standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep the pseudocode high-level and easy to read. Prefer single-line statements wherever possible—even if it requires omitting some less critical details—to reduce line count and maintain clarity. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect logical structure. Do not include any comments, explanations, summaries, or separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines, strictly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
