Evaluate the pseudocode enclosed within the following ```python ... ``` code block for **complete, unambiguous, and self-contained reproducibility**. Reproducibility means the pseudocode fully specifies all operations, conditions, edge cases, and valid inputs to precisely produce correct and consistent results that would pass **all relevant unit tests without requiring any external information or assumptions**.

Your assessment must consider:

- Logical completeness and correctness for every input scenario, including edge cases  
- Clarity and explicitness of all steps, variables, and control flow  
- Absence of vague or missing details that prevent exact implementation  
- Independence from any unstated context or information beyond whatâ€™s in the code block  

Respond with a single digit only:  
- `1` if the pseudocode meets the reproducibility criteria exactly as defined  
- `0` if it does not (e.g., is ambiguous, incomplete, insufficient, or context-dependent)  

**Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional output.**  
Outputs must precisely correspond in order to the pseudocode inputs given.
