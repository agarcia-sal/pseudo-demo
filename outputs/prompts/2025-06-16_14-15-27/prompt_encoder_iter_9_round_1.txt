Translate the given code into clear, compact pseudocode that strictly preserves its original control flow and structure, representing all variable assignments, function calls, conditionals, and loops uniformly and simply. Use mostly natural language combined with concise symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to maximize clarity and brevity. Generate mostly one-line statements wherever feasible, even at the cost of omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently using tabs to reflect structure; do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
