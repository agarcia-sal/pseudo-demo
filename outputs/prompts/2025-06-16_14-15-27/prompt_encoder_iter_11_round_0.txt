Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that strictly preserves its original structure and control flow. Represent all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals uniformly and simply. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to produce a compact, high-level, easy-to-read pseudocode. Favor one-line statements wherever possible—even if that means omitting some details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to convey structure but do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or formatting such as separator lines. Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
