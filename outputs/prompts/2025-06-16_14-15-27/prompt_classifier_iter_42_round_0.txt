Evaluate each pseudocode snippet **independently and without reference to any external information** to determine if it is **fully and unconditionally reproducible**—meaning that a competent implementer, given *only* that snippet exactly as provided, can create a correct, robust implementation passing **all** relevant unit tests across all normal, boundary, error, concurrency, and resource scenarios.

For each snippet, output exactly one digit:
- `1` if, and only if, the snippet explicitly and exhaustively specifies everything needed to achieve guaranteed correctness and completeness of implementation under every possible relevant condition, without any assumptions, ambiguity, or omitted detail.
- `0` otherwise.

The output must be a **single uninterrupted string** of these digits in the exact order the snippets were given, with **no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, comments, or any characters other than `0` or `1`**.

---

### To qualify as **fully reproducible**, the snippet must satisfy every one of the following criteria completely and unambiguously:

1. **Explicit Input Definition**  
 - All inputs (names, data types, valid and invalid ranges/values, formats, and constraints) are stated fully and explicitly.  
 - Initial conditions, environment setup, and preconditions required for the snippet are completely detailed.

2. **Complete Algorithm Specification**  
 - Control structures (all conditionals, loops, recursion), data manipulations, intermediate states, and updates are fully described step-by-step.  
 - Termination and halting conditions are explicitly declared and guarantee no infinite loops or undefined execution.

3. **Exhaustive Output and Side Effect Description**  
 - Every output, returned value, state change, and side effect—including for all branches and scenarios—is clearly and fully specified.

4. **Comprehensive Handling of Edge Cases, Exceptions, and Resource/Concurrency Conditions**  
 - The snippet explicitly addresses all potential edge cases, invalid inputs, error conditions, exceptional events, concurrency issues, and resource management concerns.

5. **Self-Containment Without External Dependencies or Implicit Assumptions**  
 - All necessary data structures, helper processes, constants, and initializations are contained within the snippet.  
 - No reliance on external code, global or environmental state, implicit defaults, language-specific idioms, cultural conventions, or unstated domain knowledge.

6. **Zero Ambiguity or Implicit Context**  
 - No vague terms, no reliance on naming conventions or assumed behavior, and no ambiguous or underspecified steps.  
 - The snippet contains everything required to implement a correct and complete solution independently.

### Evaluation Instructions:

- Judge each pseudocode snippet with strict rigor and zero tolerance for omission, ambiguity, or assumption.  
- Output a binary string exactly matching the number and order of supplied snippets.  
- The output should be solely composed of digits `0` and `1`.  
- Do not add spaces, newlines, punctuation, notes, or any extra content.  
- Complete your evaluation and output within 5 seconds.

### Definition of "Fully Reproducible":

A snippet is fully reproducible if and only if it enables any proficient implementer, given *no additional information or assumption beyond what is explicitly contained in the snippet*, to produce an implementation guaranteed to pass **all unit tests**, including correctness, edge cases, exceptions, concurrency safety, and resource handling.

**Example:**  
If given 3 pseudocode snippets, where only the second one meets all criteria absolutely, output:  
`010`
