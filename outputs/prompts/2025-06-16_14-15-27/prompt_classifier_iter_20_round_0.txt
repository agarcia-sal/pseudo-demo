Given a batch of one or more pseudocode snippets, independently evaluate each snippet to determine whether it is **fully reproducible**, meaning it will pass **all possible unit tests** over the **complete valid input domain** based strictly on the snippet’s explicit content, without assuming any external knowledge or filling gaps by inference.

For each snippet, output exactly one digit, in order:

- **1** if and only if the snippet satisfies *all* reproducibility requirements below with absolute clarity, completeness, and rigor—no ambiguity, no omissions, no implicit assumptions—and  
- **0** otherwise.

**Reproducibility requirements:** The snippet must explicitly and unambiguously satisfy *all* these, internally and fully, without relying on any external context:

1. **Precise and exhaustive specification of inputs, outputs, and all intermediate variables:** Including data types, formats, valid value ranges, and constraints—fully detailed so there is zero uncertainty.

2. **Complete, deterministic coverage of the entire specified input domain:** The logic must explicitly handle every possible valid input case including normal, boundary, and edge cases—no gaps, no partial handling, no unstated assumptions.

3. **Thorough, explicit management of all errors, exceptions, invalid inputs, and edge conditions:** All abnormal or exceptional cases are foreseen and safely handled within the snippet to avoid undefined or unpredictable behavior.

4. **Clear, unambiguous, and deterministic operational semantics and control flow:** The snippet’s instructions and state transitions guarantee the same output every run given the same input, with no contradictions, vagueness, or nondeterminism.

5. **Fully self-contained logic and specification:** No reliance on implicit rules, unstated external definitions, or background knowledge beyond the snippet itself to ensure reproducibility.

**Additional instructions:**

- Do **not** infer or guess any missing details; any lack of explicit completeness or clarity mandates a 0 for that snippet.

- For multiple snippets, output a continuous string of 1’s and 0’s reflecting reproducibility of each snippet **in the order provided**, without spaces, delimiters, explanations, or extra characters.

- The output must contain only these digits and nothing else.

- Respond within 5 seconds per batch.

**Remember:** Each digit corresponds exactly to each input snippet’s reproducibility classification. Output only the digit string—no commentary or formatting.
