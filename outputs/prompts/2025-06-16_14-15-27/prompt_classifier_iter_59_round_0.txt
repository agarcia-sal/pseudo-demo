Evaluate each pseudocode snippet *independently* and *without using any external knowledge, assumptions, or interpretation beyond the snippet itself*. Determine if the snippet is **fully reproducible**, meaning it can be implemented exactly as-is, *without any ambiguity or missing information*, and will reliably pass *all* relevant unit tests—including all valid inputs, invalid inputs, edge cases, and exceptional scenarios.

### Full Reproducibility Criteria (all must hold):

1. **Explicitly Defined Inputs:**  
 - Every input parameter, variable, and environmental dependency is fully declared with unambiguous names, precise data types, exact constraints (value ranges, valid formats), and no assumptions on implicit inputs.  
 - No reliance on external or undefined inputs.

2. **Deterministic and Complete Algorithmic Steps:**  
 - Every step, condition, control flow, and iteration is clearly and unambiguously described, with no logical gaps, unspecified cases, or underdefined behavior.  
 - The algorithm guarantees termination for all valid inputs and explicitly defines stopping conditions.

3. **Complete and Unambiguous Outputs and Side Effects:**  
 - Outputs and any side effects are exhaustively specified for every possible execution path (normal, boundary, error, and special cases).  
 - If concurrency, asynchrony, or timing influence behavior, these are precisely and fully delineated to ensure deterministic results.

4. **Explicit, Comprehensive Error and Exception Handling:**  
 - All potential errors or exceptional states (invalid inputs, failures, resource limits, race conditions) are anticipated and explicitly handled with clear strategies.  
 - No silent failures, undefined error states, or missing error logic.

5. **Self-Containment and Independence:**  
 - All variables, types, constants, helper routines, and assumptions are completely present within the snippet with no hidden dependencies, external libraries, or platform/language-specific constructs.  
 - No reliance on external state, globals, or implicit environment.

6. **Absolute Precision and Unambiguity:**  
 - The pseudocode uses no vague terms, contradictory statements, or omissions.  
 - It can be directly translated into a deterministic implementation requiring zero guesswork or inference.

### Instructions for Evaluation and Output:

- For a given list of pseudocode snippets in the order presented, output a single binary string with one character per snippet.  
- Output `1` if the snippet satisfies *all* above criteria and will certainly pass all unit tests.  
- Output `0` if the snippet violates any criterion resulting in ambiguity, incompleteness, or any potential test failure.  
- Output *only* the binary string with no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, explanation, or additional text.  
- The nth character corresponds exactly to the nth snippet evaluated.  
- Complete evaluation and output within 5 seconds.

**Example:**  
If given three snippets where only the first and third are fully reproducible, output:  
`101`

---

**Summary:**  
Produce an N-length binary string representing reproducibility of N snippets with perfect fidelity:  
`1` = fully reproducible, guaranteed to pass all unit tests  
`0` = any ambiguity, incompleteness, or potential failure

---

**IMPORTANT:** Output *only* the binary string, nothing else.
