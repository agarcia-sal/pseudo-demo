Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves all control flows, variable assignments, function calls, and loops using simple, uniform expressions. Favor mostly natural language with brief symbolic notations and standard abbreviations. Produce compact, easy-to-read pseudocode, prioritizing one-line statements and omitting less critical details if it reduces the total lines. Maintain correct indentation for nested blocks reflecting structure. Do not include comments, explanations, or formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines following this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
