Translate the given code into concise, uniform pseudocode that preserves the original control flow and structure exactly, including all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly clear natural language with minimal symbols and standard abbreviations. Prioritize compactness and readability: prefer one-line statements, symbolic operators where unambiguous, and omit less critical details if it reduces line count. Always indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure. Do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or separator lines. Output strictly numbered pseudocode lines in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
