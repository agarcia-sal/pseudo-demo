Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow and structure. Represent all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals uniformly and simply, favoring compact natural language mixed with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Prioritize one-liner statements wherever possible—even if that means omitting some details to minimize line count—while keeping the pseudocode easy to read and structurally clear. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect code hierarchy. Do not add comments, explanations, summaries, separator lines, or extra formatting.

Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
