Translate the given code into concise, uniform pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow and structure, clearly representing all variable assignments, function calls, conditionals, loops, and control statements. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to produce a high-level, compact, and easy-to-read pseudocode. Prefer single-line statements whenever possible, even if it means omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect the code hierarchy. Do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
