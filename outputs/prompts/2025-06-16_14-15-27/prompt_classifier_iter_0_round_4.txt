Evaluate the pseudocode provided inside a ```python ... ``` code block to determine whether it is fully **reproducible**, defined by the following rigorous criteria:

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification:**  
   Every element of the solution is fully described, including:
   - All variables, data structures, and their initializations  
   - Inputs and their valid domains and constraints  
   - Each operation, computation, condition, and decision point  
   - Control flow for all loops, branches, and recursions  
   - Handling of all normal, edge, and corner cases explicitly  

2. **Self-Containment:**  
   The pseudocode includes all necessary information within the provided block; no external assumptions, implicit knowledge, or missing details are needed to implement and verify correctness.

3. **Deterministic and Unambiguous:**  
   The logic is clear and precise, allowing direct translation into working code without guesswork or interpretation; there are no contradictions, ambiguities, or underspecified behaviors.

4. **Complete Test Coverage:**  
   The code suffices to guarantee passing **all relevant unit tests**, including boundary tests and exceptional inputs compatible with the given problem constraints.

Your task is to **output exactly one digit per input pseudocode block:**

- Output `1` if the pseudocode meets all the above conditions and is guaranteed reproducible and test-passing as-is.  
- Output `0` otherwise.

**Important:**  
- Input pseudocodes will always be enclosed within a ```python ... ``` code block.  
- Process each code block independently and output only the corresponding digit in the order received.  
- Do **not** provide any explanations, formatting, text, or commentsâ€”output only `1` or `0` for each input.  
- Ensure your evaluation respects all the criteria strictly to maximize accuracy.

Example input format you will receive and evaluate:  
```
python
# pseudocode here
```

Your output must strictly align with the input order, one digit per block, with no additional text or spacing.
