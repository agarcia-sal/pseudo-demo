Evaluate each pseudocode snippet *exactly as provided*, fully independently, without assuming or adding any implied or external context, knowledge, or code. Your sole goal is to determine whether the pseudocode defines a completely reproducible algorithm that *guarantees passing all unit tests* under *every* valid, invalid, boundary, and exceptional input condition—as if it were directly translatable into a correct implementation without any need for guesswork or assumptions.

### Strict Reproducibility Definition (all conditions must be strictly met):

1. **Explicit Inputs and Preconditions**  
 - Every input, parameter, and dependency is clearly named and typed.  
 - Input value ranges, formats, and constraints are exhaustively and precisely described.  
 - All external environmental assumptions or dependencies affecting execution are explicitly stated.

2. **Fully Deterministic, Complete Algorithm Description**  
 - All procedural steps, decision branches, loops, and recursion are thoroughly and unambiguously detailed, specifying exact control flow and logic.  
 - The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate for *all* allowed inputs, with clearly specified termination conditions.

3. **Comprehensive Output and Side Effect Specification**  
 - Every output or effect (return values, variable modifications, state changes, I/O) is unambiguously defined for every possible execution path, including normal, edge, error, and exception cases.  
 - Any concurrent, asynchronous, or timing-related behaviors are exhaustively defined to fully exclude nondeterministic outcomes.

4. **Explicit Handling of Errors and Exceptional Situations**  
 - All invalid inputs, runtime errors, resource constraints, and concurrency hazards (e.g., deadlocks, race conditions) are explicitly identified and exactly handled.  
 - Recovery, rollback, cleanup, or error propagation measures are clearly laid out wherever applicable.

5. **Complete Internal Definitions and Independence**  
 - All variables, data structures, helper routines, constants, and assumptions are defined or declared within the snippet’s scope.  
 - The snippet does *not* rely on hidden globals, external libraries, language-specific defaults, or unspecified behaviors.

6. **Absolute Clarity, Precision, and Lack of Ambiguity**  
 - The pseudocode is rigorously unambiguous, free from contradictions, omissions, or open-ended descriptions, making it directly and reliably implementable without additional interpretation or assumptions.

### Output Instructions:

- For all snippets, in the exact order received, output a single digit per snippet:  
 `1` if the pseudocode strictly meets *all* the above reproducibility criteria,  
 `0` otherwise.  
- Output only the concatenated binary digits as a single string with no separators, spaces, punctuation, line breaks, headers, or commentary.  
- Do not output explanations, summaries, or any text beyond the binary string.  
- Complete all evaluations within the 5-second runtime limit.

---

**Summary:**  
Your output is a binary string of length equal to the number of input pseudocode snippets:  
- `1` = fully reproducible pseudocode guaranteed to pass all unit tests in all scenarios  
- `0` = any ambiguity, incompleteness, undefined or under-specified behavior, or missing information

**Example:**  
For three input snippets where only the first and third are reproducible, output exactly:  
`101`
