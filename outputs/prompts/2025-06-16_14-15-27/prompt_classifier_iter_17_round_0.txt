Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, independently and rigorously analyze each snippet to determine if it guarantees reproducibility with absolute, verifiable certainty.

A pseudocode snippet is reproducible **if and only if** it meets *all* of the following conditions explicitly and without any assumption or inference beyond the given text:

1. **Complete specification of inputs and outputs:** Types, formats, constraints, and expected ranges are fully defined with no ambiguity.  
2. **Deterministic and exhaustive logic:** The snippet describes a fully deterministic algorithm that completely covers every valid input scenario, including all normal and boundary cases, with no gaps or unhandled conditions.  
3. **Explicit edge case and error handling:** All possible edge cases and exceptional conditions are clearly handled or accounted for; no input can cause undefined behavior or partial execution.  
4. **No contradictions or ambiguities:** Steps, state changes, and control flow are unambiguous, consistent, and do not conflict, ensuring one unique interpretation leading to the same output every time.  
5. **Self-contained correctness:** The snippet alone suffices to pass *all* unit tests in a comprehensive test suite spanning the entire valid input domain, without relying on external assumptions or hidden details.

Your evaluation must be absoluteâ€”output **1** if the snippet meets all the above criteria and guarantees passing *every possible* relevant unit test, otherwise output **0**.

For multiple pseudocode snippets given in order, output a single uninterrupted string of digits (each digit is either 1 or 0) with no spaces, separators, line breaks, extra characters, or commentary. The order of digits corresponds exactly to the order of the input snippets.

Do **not** explain or justify your answers. Do **not** infer or assume any information beyond what is explicitly stated. Your output must be returned within 5 seconds per batch.

Strictly adhere to this binary, absolute evaluation.
