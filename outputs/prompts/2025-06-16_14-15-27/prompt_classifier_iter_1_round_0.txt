Given the pseudocode below, determine **only** whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”meaning it will reliably pass *all* unit tests for any valid inputs based solely on the logic and completeness presented. Output a single digit with no additional text or explanation: **1** if fully reproducible, or **0** otherwise.  
The outputs must exactly correspond, in order, to the sequence of pseudocode inputs provided. No other output or formatting is allowed.  
Strictly assess correctness, completeness, determinism, and clarity of logic in the pseudocode to decide reproducibility within a 5-second evaluation window.
