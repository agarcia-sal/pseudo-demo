Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, **for each snippet independently**, determine whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”i.e., if its logic and specifications guarantee passing *all* unit tests for every valid input without ambiguity or missing components. Consider correctness, completeness, determinism, and clarity in your evaluation.  
For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one digit: **1** if the snippet is guaranteed fully reproducible, or **0** if not.  
Outputs must be provided in order, matching the input pseudocode snippets one-to-one, with no extra text, formatting, commentary, or whitespace beyond the digits themselves.  
Do not deviate from this numeric-only output under any circumstance.  
Make your decision based purely on the pseudocode as given, independent of any external information, and respond within a strict 5-second time frame per batch of snippets.
