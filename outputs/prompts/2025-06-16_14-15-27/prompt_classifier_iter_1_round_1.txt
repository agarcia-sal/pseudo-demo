Evaluate the pseudocode provided within the designated ```python ... ``` code block.  
Your task is to determine if this pseudocode is fully reproducible, meaning it:  
- explicitly and unambiguously specifies all necessary steps, conditions, and data manipulations required to produce correct results for **every valid input**, and  
- is detailed and precise enough to guarantee passing **all possible unit tests** without relying on external assumptions or omitted information.  

**Instructions:**  
- Carefully consider completeness, clarity, determinism, and absence of ambiguity.  
- Assume the pseudocode must be self-contained and implementable as-is to pass all tests.  
- Output **only one digit:**  
  - **1** if the pseudocode meets these criteria and is reproducible,  
  - **0** if it is incomplete, ambiguous, under-specified, or otherwise unable to guarantee passing all unit tests.  
- Output nothing elseâ€”no explanations, no extra text, no formatting, no whitespace beyond the single digit.  
- The evaluation applies to each pseudocode snippet in order, matching one output digit per snippet fed.
