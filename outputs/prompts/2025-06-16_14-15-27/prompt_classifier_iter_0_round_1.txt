Evaluate the following pseudocode enclosed within the ```python ... ``` code block. Determine if the pseudocode is fully reproducible, meaning it contains all necessary and precise steps to reliably pass all unit tests for any valid inputs, with no ambiguity or missing details. Output **only** a single digit:  
- **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible and would pass all unit tests,  
- **0** if it is not reproducible or insufficient to guarantee passing all unit tests.  
Do not output anything else.  

Here is the pseudocode to evaluate:
