Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output exactly one digit per snippet—concatenated strictly in the input order—with no spaces, punctuation, explanations, or any extraneous characters.

**Output:**  
- Output **1** if and only if the snippet is **fully reproducible**: it constitutes a completely self-contained, explicit, and deterministic specification that guarantees any correct implementation derived from it will pass **every** conceivable unit test—including all normal, edge, boundary, invalid, and exceptional input cases—without ambiguity, silent failure, or undefined behavior.  
- Output **0** otherwise.

**Criteria for full reproducibility (all must hold unconditionally):**

1. **Complete and explicit input definition:**  
 - All inputs, parameters, and data structures are unambiguously named, typed, and defined with precise domains, ranges, formats, and initial states.  
 - No assumptions or inferences are necessary to understand input validity or structure.

2. **Exhaustive output and behavior specification:**  
 - Outputs and final states are precisely described for every possible valid and invalid input scenario.  
 - Output types, formats, values, and structures are unambiguous and cover normal responses, error messages, and boundary conditions.

3. **Deterministic, fully detailed algorithmic description:**  
 - Every computational step, control flow mechanism (loops, recursion, conditionals), and state update is explicitly and exactly defined, including all conditions for branch coverage and termination.  
 - There are no gaps, vagueness, or nondeterministic elements.

4. **Explicit error handling and robustness guarantees:**  
 - The pseudocode anticipates every potential fault, invalid input, exception, infinite or premature termination, deadlock, or failure scenario and prescribes explicit, deterministic handling or return values.  
 - No silent crashes, undefined states, or hanging processes.

5. **No external dependencies or hidden context:**  
 - The snippet is fully self-contained; it does not rely on external environment state, undocumented globals, libraries, side effects, or background assumptions not present within the snippet.  
 - All auxiliary data, helper algorithm steps, and definitions needed for implementation are included.

6. **Zero reliance on implicit conventions or domain knowledge:**  
 - No undocumented assumptions, unwritten rules, implicit language or domain conventions, or references to unspecified protocols.  
 - The snippet alone must have sufficient explicit detail to implement and verify correctness in isolation.

**Instructions:**  
- Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, analyze each independently and **output exactly one digit per snippet**, concatenated in input order with no separators.  
- Output **only digits**, **no explanations, whitespace, or formatting**.  
- Respond within 5 seconds per batch.

This prompt enforces a rigorous, all-encompassing standard for determining reproducibility by leveraging exhaustive criteria focused on full coverage, determinism, explicitness, and self-containment, ensuring the output precisely identifies whether each snippet guarantees that any derived implementation will pass **all** unit tests and handle every possible scenario correctly.

**Reminder:** Output format example for 3 snippets: if snippet1 is reproducible, snippet2 is not, snippet3 is reproducible, output: `101`
