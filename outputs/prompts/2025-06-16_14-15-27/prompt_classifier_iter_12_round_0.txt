Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, analyze each snippet **independently and thoroughly** to determine if it is fully reproducible—meaning the pseudocode is:  
- *logically correct* (the algorithm always produces the correct output for all valid inputs),  
- *complete* (all necessary steps, conditions, and edge cases are explicitly or implicitly handled without ambiguity or missing elements),  
- *deterministic* (outputs are predictable and consistent on repeated executions with the same input), and  
- *clear and unambiguous* (free from contradictions or undefined behaviors that prevent reliable implementation).  

For each pseudocode snippet, output a single digit: **1** if the snippet is guaranteed to pass **all** unit tests on **all valid inputs** without requiring external assumptions or additional information, or **0** otherwise.  

Ensure that your output strictly contains only the digits—one per snippet—in the exact order the snippets were provided, with no extra spaces, line breaks, explanations, or any other characters.  

Base your decision solely on the content of the pseudocode presented; do not infer or seek external information. Respond with your output in under 5 seconds per input batch.
