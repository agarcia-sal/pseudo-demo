Evaluate the pseudocode enclosed strictly within a ```python ... ``` code block to determine if it is fully **reproducible**, meaning it can be directly implemented and will pass all unit tests under the following comprehensive criteria:

1. **Explicit and Complete Definition:**  
   - All inputs are clearly specified with their types, valid ranges, and constraints.  
   - Every variable and data structure is defined and initialized.  
   - The logic details every computation step, condition, and decision path without gaps.  
   - Control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion) is fully described, with termination conditions.  
   - All relevant cases—including typical, boundary, edge, and exceptional scenarios—are explicitly handled.

2. **Fully Self-Contained:**  
   There are no external dependencies, unstated assumptions, or missing information; the entire solution context and mechanics exist only within the given code block.

3. **Deterministic, Precise, and Unambiguous:**  
   - The pseudocode is clear without vague language, contradictions, or underspecifications.  
   - It admits a single correct implementation interpretation.  
   - Any non-deterministic behavior or ambiguity invalidates reproducibility.

4. **Complete Functional Correctness with Test Coverage:**  
   The pseudocode guarantees passing all conceivable unit tests for the stated problem—including boundary and exceptional inputs—based solely on the provided information.

**Instructions:**  
- Examine each input pseudocode block independently and output one digit per block:  
  - Output `1` if it meets all the above criteria, ensuring reproducibility and universal test passability as provided.  
  - Output `0` otherwise.  
- Each input will be a single pseudocode snippet enclosed in a ```python ... ``` code block.  
- Output exactly one digit per block, with no extra text, formatting, or explanation.  
- The outputs must be in the exact order that the pseudocode blocks are received.  
- Strictly enforce the criteria to maximize reliability and accuracy.

Example input format you will receive for evaluation:  
```
python
# pseudocode here
```

Example output for that block (only one digit, `1` or `0`, depending on reproducibility).
