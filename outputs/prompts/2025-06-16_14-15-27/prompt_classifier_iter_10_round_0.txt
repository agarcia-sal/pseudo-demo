Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, evaluate each snippet **independently** for whether it is fully reproducible—that is, whether the snippet’s logic, structure, and specifications provide a complete, unambiguous, and deterministic solution that guarantees passing *all* unit tests for every valid input, without needing any external assumptions or additional information. Consider all aspects of correctness, completeness, determinism, input coverage, and clarity (including variable definitions, control flow, edge cases, and algorithmic steps).  

For **each** pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character: **1** if the snippet is fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all tests, or **0** if it is not. The outputs must appear in the exact same order as the input snippets, concatenated without spaces, line breaks, or any other characters or formatting.  

Do **not** include any text, explanation, punctuation, or whitespace—only the sequence of digits representing each snippet’s reproducibility assessment. Your determination must rely solely on the content of the pseudocode provided, with no external knowledge or assumptions.  

Respond promptly, within 5 seconds for each batch of input snippets. Any deviation from these output or timing requirements will be considered incorrect.
