Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output a single digit per snippet—**1** if it is fully reproducible or **0** otherwise—based solely on the following rigorous criteria. The output must be a concatenated string of digits corresponding exactly, in order, to the input snippets, with no spaces, punctuation, explanation, or any other characters.

**Strict definition of fully reproducible (output = 1):**  
A snippet is reproducible if and only if all these conditions are explicitly and unambiguously met without relying on any external knowledge, inference, or assumptions:

1. **Explicit and exhaustive input definition:**  
 • Every input variable, parameter, or data structure is fully specified with explicit types, valid value ranges, formats, and constraints.  
 • No inputs are implied, partial, or omitted.  

2. **Explicit and unambiguous output definition:**  
 • The output(s) are clearly described without ambiguity, including types and formats.  
 • Outputs precisely correspond to the specified inputs and problem scope.  

3. **Fully specified deterministic logic covering all valid and invalid inputs:**  
 • All possible input cases, including normal, boundary, and edge cases, are explicitly addressed.  
 • Control flow (conditionals, loops, recursion) is completely described without ambiguity or underspecification.  
 • No unspecified, implicit, or loosely defined branches or behaviors remain.  

4. **Explicit error and exception management within the snippet:**  
 • All invalid inputs, exceptional conditions, and error states are anticipated and handled explicitly inside the snippet.  
 • No undefined or unhandled behavior under any scenario is present.  

5. **Deterministic, self-contained execution without external dependencies:**  
 • Behavior does not depend on any implicit context, environment, external state, or nondeterministic elements like randomness or timing.  
 • All state, intermediate variables, and operations are fully described within the snippet.  

6. **No implicit assumptions or hidden knowledge:**  
 • The snippet stands entirely on its own; all necessary information to understand, implement, and test it is contained within it.  
 • No reliance on unwritten conventions, external documentation, or inferred meaning is permitted.  

**Operational instructions:**  
- For each snippet, output one digit: **1** if *and only if* it meets all above criteria, else **0**.  
- Concatenate digits strictly in the input order, with no separators or extra characters.  
- Do not output any explanation, comments, whitespace, or line breaks.  
- If any ambiguity, incompleteness, or uncertainty arises, output **0** for that snippet.  
- Complete all evaluations within 5 seconds.  

**Summary:**  
Given one or multiple pseudocode snippets, determine reproducibility by producing a digit string where each digit reflects whether its corresponding snippet is fully, explicitly, and unambiguously specified to guarantee passing all unit tests (1), or not (0), following the above exacting standards.
