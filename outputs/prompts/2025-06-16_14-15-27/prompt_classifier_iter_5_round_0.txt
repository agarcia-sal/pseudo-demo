Given the pseudocode below, **without any additional commentary or formatting**, determine if it is guaranteed to pass *all* unit tests for every valid input based strictly on the logic, completeness, determinism, and unambiguous correctness of the pseudocode as presented.  
Output exactly one digit per pseudocode input:  
- **1** if the pseudocode is fully reproducible (correct and complete for all valid inputs)  
- **0** if it is not reproducible (contains logical errors, incomplete conditions, ambiguity, or nondeterminism).  

Evaluate each pseudocode independently and output the sequence of digits in the exact order the pseudocode inputs are provided. No extra spaces, line breaks, text, or explanations are allowed.  
Make your assessment solely on the pseudocode logic within **5 seconds** per input, ensuring no assumptions beyond what is explicitly given.
