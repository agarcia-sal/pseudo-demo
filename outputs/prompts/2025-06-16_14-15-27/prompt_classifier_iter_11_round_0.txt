Given one or more pseudocode snippets as input, **independently evaluate each snippet’s reproducibility**—defined as the ability of its logic, structure, and details to guarantee passing *all* unit tests on all valid inputs without ambiguity, contradiction, incompleteness, or reliance on external context.  
For each snippet, carefully verify that it is:  
- **Correct:** accurately implements the intended functionality without logical errors.  
- **Complete:** includes all necessary steps, definitions, and edge case handling.  
- **Deterministic:** produces consistent outputs for the same inputs without undefined behavior or randomness.  
- **Clear and unambiguous:** has sufficiently detailed instructions and well-defined operations to enable exact implementation.  

Output exactly **one digit (1 or 0) per snippet**:  
- Output **1** if, and only if, the snippet is guaranteed reproducible and passes all unit tests under the above criteria.  
- Output **0** otherwise.  

All outputs must be concatenated as a sequence of digits, in the exact order the snippets are given, without spaces, newlines, comments, or any additional text.  
Do not output anything other than this sequence of digits.  
Make your decision solely based on the information provided by the pseudocode, ignoring any external assumptions.  
Respond promptly, within 5 seconds for the entire batch.
