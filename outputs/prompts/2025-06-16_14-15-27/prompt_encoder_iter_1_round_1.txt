Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that exactly preserves its original control flow, variable assignments, function calls, and loops in a uniform, simple style. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to maximize readability and brevity. Prefer one-line statements including guarded assignments and loops, even if this means omitting less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect structure but do not add comments, explanations, separator lines, or summaries. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines as shown, strictly following this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use terms like “in function [name]”, “let [var] be [type]”, “read [var]”, “set [var] to … if …”, “for [var] = … to … exclusive/inclusive”, “call [func] with …”, “print …”, etc. Maintain a minimalistic, high-level style aligned with the example below:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
