Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow and structure, expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals clearly and uniformly. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbols and standard abbreviations to keep it compact and readable. Prefer one-liner statements and symbolic expressions where reasonable, even if it means omitting some details to reduce length. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect hierarchy. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines in this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
