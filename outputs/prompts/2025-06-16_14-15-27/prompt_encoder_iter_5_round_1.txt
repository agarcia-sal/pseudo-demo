Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves all original control flow structures and operations (variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals) uniformly and simply. Use mostly natural language with brief symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep the pseudocode compact and readable. Prefer single-line statements and minimal detail, even if it means omitting some less critical information to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to show structure. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
