Evaluate each pseudocode snippet *exactly as given*, fully independently, with no assumptions, external context, or inferred information. Your sole task is to determine if the snippet is *unconditionally reproducible*: that is, directly and fully translatable into a correct implementation that will pass *all* unit tests covering every valid, invalid, edge, and exceptional input scenario without any ambiguity or missing information.

### Reproducibility Criteria (all must be met):

1. **Explicit and Exhaustive Input Specification**  
 - Inputs, parameters, and dependencies must be clearly named, typed, and precisely constrained—covering ranges, formats, and allowable values.  
 - All required environmental or external preconditions are explicitly declared.  
 - No reliance on unspecified defaults or contextual assumptions.

2. **Complete, Deterministic, and Unambiguous Algorithm Description**  
 - Every control structure (branches, loops, recursion) is fully detailed with explicit logic and flow—no gaps or implicit steps.  
 - The algorithm must guarantee termination for *all* specified inputs, with stated termination conditions.

3. **Comprehensive Definition of Outputs and Side Effects**  
 - All outputs, state mutations, side effects, and observable behaviors are precisely defined for *every* execution path, including normal, boundary, error, and exception cases.  
 - Any concurrency, asynchronous behavior, or timing considerations must be clearly and exhaustively specified to exclude nondeterminism.

4. **Complete and Explicit Error and Exception Handling**  
 - All invalid inputs, runtime errors, resource constraints, and concurrency hazards must be explicitly identified and correctly handled within the pseudocode.  
 - Recovery, rollback, cleanup, or error propagation steps must be clearly laid out where applicable.

5. **Fully Self-Contained Definitions Without External Dependencies**  
 - All variables, data structures, helper routines, constants, and assumptions used must be explicitly defined or declared within the snippet.  
 - No dependency on hidden globals, external libraries, language-specific or platform-specific behavior, or unstated mechanisms.

6. **Absolute Clarity, Precision, and Lack of Ambiguity or Contradiction**  
 - The pseudocode must be entirely free from vagueness, conflicting statements, omissions, or open-ended descriptions—fully deterministic and implementable without interpretation or guesswork.

### Output Instructions:

- For each pseudocode snippet, output a single digit—`1` if *all* above criteria are met exactly, otherwise `0`.  
- The output must be a single concatenated binary string corresponding in order to the input snippets—no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, headers, explanations, or any other text.  
- Strictly adhere to a maximum evaluation time of 5 seconds total.

**Summary:**  
Given N pseudocode snippets, output a string of length N where:  
- `1` = snippet is fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass *all* unit tests under all input conditions.  
- `0` = snippet is ambiguous, incomplete, under-specified, erroneous, or relies on unstated assumptions.

**Example:**  
If given three pseudocodes where only the first and third are fully reproducible, output:  
`101`
