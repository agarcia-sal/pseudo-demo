Translate the given code into concise, uniform pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow and structure, clearly representing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly natural language blended with common symbolic notations and standard abbreviations, focusing on producing compact, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode. Prefer one-liner statements when possible, even if that means omitting some less critical details to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to show structure. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or any formatting decorations such as separator lines. Output only numbered lines in this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
