Translate the given code into concise, uniform pseudocode that exactly preserves its original control flow and structure, including all variable assignments, function calls, conditionals, and loops, using mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Produce a compact, high-level, and easy-to-read output favoring single-line statements wherever possible—even if that means omitting some details to keep the pseudocode brief. Indent nested blocks consistently to show hierarchy. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or any formatting outside numbered lines. Omit separator lines and extra whitespace. Output only numbered pseudocode lines in this exact style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
