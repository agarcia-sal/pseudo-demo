Translate the input code into concise pseudocode that strictly preserves all original control flow and structure. Express every variable assignment, function call, loop, and conditional clearly and uniformly, using mostly natural language enriched with standard, compact symbolic notations and widely accepted abbreviations to keep the pseudocode compact and high-level. Favor single-line statements wherever possible—even if omitting some less critical details—to minimize line count while maintaining correctness. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect code structure. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting such as separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines, exactly following this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
