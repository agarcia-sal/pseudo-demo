Translate the given code into clear, compact pseudocode that strictly preserves its original control flow and structure, uniformly expressing all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mostly natural language but allow concise symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep the pseudocode high-level and easy to read. Prefer single-line statements whenever possible, omitting less critical details if needed to reduce line count. Indent nested blocks consistently to reflect logical structure. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or separators. Output only numbered pseudocode lines in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
