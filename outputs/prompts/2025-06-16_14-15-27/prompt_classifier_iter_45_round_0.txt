Evaluate each pseudocode snippet *completely independently* and with *no external context or assumptions*. For each snippet, determine if it is **unambiguously fully reproducible**—meaning a skilled developer, given *only* the snippet exactly as written, can produce a complete, fully correct, and robust implementation guaranteed to pass **all** unit tests for correctness, including all edge cases, error handling, concurrency/synchronization issues, resource constraints, and performance requirements.

Your assessment must adhere strictly and literally to the snippet text. Do **not** infer, guess, or fill in any missing detail. If **any** required aspect below is absent, incomplete, ambiguous, or underspecified, mark the snippet as not reproducible.

### Strict Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be fully met):

1. **Explicit Input Specification**  
 - All inputs clearly defined: variables named, types declared, valid value ranges or formats precisely stated.  
 - All initial states, environment assumptions, and preconditions fully and unambiguously detailed.  

2. **Complete and Clear Algorithm Steps**  
 - Every step of the algorithm is explicitly described: control flow (loops, recursion, conditionals), state changes, intermediate values, and computations are fully and precisely given.  
 - Termination conditions explicitly stated, guaranteeing proper halting without infinite loops or undefined states.

3. **Exhaustive Output and State Effects**  
 - All outputs, return values, mutations, side-effects, or state changes specified for every valid and invalid input.  
 - Behavior defined for all cases including success, failure, edge conditions, exceptions, and any asynchronous or concurrent effects.

4. **Comprehensive Edge Case and Failure Handling**  
 - All invalid inputs, error scenarios, exceptions, concurrency concerns (e.g., race conditions, locking), resource management, and cleanup steps explicitly addressed and unambiguous.

5. **Totally Self-Contained and Independent**  
 - All helper functions, data structures, constants, and initializations needed are fully specified or included.  
 - No reliance on external code, environment defaults, global states, language-specific quirks, or implied domain knowledge.

6. **Zero Ambiguity or Unstated Assumptions**  
 - No vague wording, implicit guesses, unquantified terms, or partial information.  
 - The snippet alone enables an implementer to create a correct, complete, and robust implementation without any additional information.

### Instructions for Output:

- For each snippet, output exactly one digit:  
 `1` if fully reproducible,  
 `0` if not.  
- Emit the outputs as a single uninterrupted string, matching the order snippets were given.  
- Output nothing else—no spaces, newlines, explanations, or characters beyond `0` and `1`.  
- Strictly do **not** infer or assume beyond the text provided.  
- Complete evaluation within 5 seconds per batch.

**Reminder:**  
A snippet must enable a competent developer to implement a fully working, robust solution that passes **all unit tests for every case**, based solely on the snippet itself, with no external assumptions or missing detail.

**Example:**  
Given four snippets, if only the first and last meet the criteria, output:  
`1001`
