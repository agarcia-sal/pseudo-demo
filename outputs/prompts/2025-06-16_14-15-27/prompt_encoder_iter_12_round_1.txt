Translate the given code into concise, uniformly formatted pseudocode that faithfully preserves the original control flow and structure, including all variable assignments, function calls, loops, and conditionals. Use mainly clear natural language combined with standard symbolic notations and standard abbreviations to keep the output compact and high-level. Favor single-line statements and allow omission of less critical details if it significantly reduces length while retaining correctness. Indent nested blocks consistently to show structure but omit comments, explanations, summaries, or decorative formatting. Output only numbered pseudocode lines exactly in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
