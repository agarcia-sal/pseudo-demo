Evaluate each pseudocode snippet separately to determine if it is fully and unambiguously reproducible—that is, whether its logic, inputs, outputs, and all procedural details are complete, deterministic, and sufficient to guarantee passing *every* unit test over the entire valid input domain without error, ambiguity, or missing information.  
Assess without assumptions or external knowledge, relying solely on the given pseudocode text. Consider correctness, completeness, termination, well-defined behavior in all cases, and absence of contradictions or unspecified steps.  
For each snippet, output exactly one character:  
**1** if it can be confidently concluded that the pseudocode will always pass all valid unit tests, or  
**0** if there is any uncertainty, incompleteness, ambiguity, or potential failure.  
Return a string of digits matching the order of input snippets. No additional characters, whitespace, comments, or formatting are allowed—only the digit sequence.  
Strictly respond within 5 seconds per input batch.
