Evaluate each pseudocode snippet independently and output a single binary digit for each, concatenated exactly in the order received, without spaces, punctuation, explanation, or any characters other than digits.

**Output:**  
- Output **1** if and only if the snippet is *fully reproducible*, meaning it contains all information necessary for *any* direct implementation derived from it to pass *all* conceivable unit tests (normal cases, edge cases, invalid inputs, stress tests) without any external information, assumptions, or clarifications.  
- Output **0** otherwise.

**Reproducibility Criteria:** To qualify as reproducible (output 1), *every* of the following must hold true *simultaneously*:

1. **Exhaustive Input Definition:**  
 - All inputs (parameters, data structures, initial states) are explicitly and unambiguously defined, including exact types, formats, allowed and disallowed values, and edge cases.  
 - Valid, invalid, boundary, and exceptional inputs are explicitly addressed; no input aspect is implicit or omitted.

2. **Complete and Explicit Outputs and Side Effects:**  
 - All outputs, return values, and side effects (including state mutations) are fully and precisely specified for every conceivable execution path.

3. **Deterministic, Detailed, and Terminating Algorithm Specification:**  
 - Control flow (branches, loops, recursion) and data transformations are described exhaustively, without ambiguity or implicit assumptions.  
 - Termination is guaranteed or explicit nontermination handling is provided.

4. **Comprehensive Error and Edge Case Handling:**  
 - Every error scenario, input anomaly, exceptional condition, infinite loop/deadlock possibility, and abnormal termination is explicitly precluded or safely handled.

5. **Total Self-Containment:**  
 - All required definitions (helper functions, constants, data structures, internal states) are included within the snippet.  
 - No reliance exists on external libraries, global variables, unstated environmental assumptions, or hidden contextual knowledge.

6. **No Implicit Semantics or Assumptions:**  
 - No dependence on language-specific defaults, cultural/contextual conventions, or implicit coding patterns.  
 - All semantic details are fully encoded and explicitly documented in the snippet itself.

**Instructions:**  
- Assess each snippet strictly and independently using all criteria above.  
- Produce exactly one digit per snippet: `1` if all criteria are met; `0` otherwise.  
- Concatenate digits in input order, with no separators or additional characters.  
- Output nothing else: no explanations, whitespace, or formatting.  
- Adhere to a 5-second evaluation limit for the entire batch.

**Definition of Reproducibility:**  
A snippet is reproducible only if *any* implementation directly realized from it (without external help or assumptions) can pass all conceivable unit tests, encompassing typical, boundary, invalid, and stress scenarios.

**Example:**  
For three snippets, where only the first and third meet all conditions, output:  
`101`
