Assess *each pseudocode snippet independently* and *exclusively* based on its explicit content, with no extraneous assumptions or external knowledge. Your goal is to determine whether the snippet is **completely reproducible**, defined as possessing *every explicit, unambiguous, and necessary element* enabling a direct, deterministic implementation that will *without exception* pass *all* relevant unit tests. Passing all tests means correctness on all valid inputs, invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and exceptional situations.

### Criteria for Reproducibility (all must be strictly and explicitly met):

1. **Explicit Inputs Definition:**  
 - All inputs and required context are explicitly declared with clear identifiers, explicit data types, well-defined constraints or ranges, and formats.  
 - No unspecified or implicit assumptions about input values or environment.

2. **Fully Detailed Algorithm Logic:**  
 - Every computational step, control structure (if-else, loops, recursions), and case is fully and precisely described—no gaps, implicit steps, or vague instructions.  
 - Algorithm termination conditions are explicitly stated and guaranteed for all valid input.

3. **Clear, Complete Output Specification:**  
 - All outputs or resulting state changes are explicitly defined for every possible execution path, covering normal operation, edge cases, and error conditions.  
 - Side effects, concurrency, timing, or external interactions—if present—are fully specified ensuring deterministic behavior.

4. **Comprehensive Error and Edge-Case Handling:**  
 - All invalid inputs, exceptional conditions, and edge cases are anticipated and handled explicitly with clear strategies.  
 - No silent failures, undefined behavior, or missing error responses.

5. **Self-Containment:**  
 - The snippet provides all necessary variables, constants, helper functions, data types, and assumptions within itself.  
 - No dependence on external code, libraries, global state, or undocumented platform specifics.

6. **Deterministic and Unambiguous Wording:**  
 - Language used is precise and unambiguous; no vague, contradictory, or incomplete descriptions.  
 - The snippet can be translated into a deterministic executable implementation *without interpretation or guesswork*.

### Output Instructions:

- For a list of pseudocode snippets given *in order*, output a single continuous string of binary digits, each digit corresponding *in exact order* to a snippet's reproducibility assessment:  
 `1` = fully reproducible per all above criteria and guaranteed to pass every unit test;  
 `0` = otherwise (any ambiguity, incompleteness, or uncertainty causes 0).  
- No spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or additional characters allowed.  
- The output must contain only this binary string and nothing else.  
- Respond strictly within 5 seconds.

---

**Examples:**  
- Three snippets, only the second is reproducible → output `010`  
- Five snippets, only first and last reproducible → output `10001`

---

**IMPORTANT:** Output *only* the binary string corresponding to the snippets evaluated, without explanation or extraneous content.  
Any deviation will be considered non-compliant.

---

**Summary:** For N pseudocode snippets, produce an N-character binary string where each character is:  
`1` = snippet is absolutely reproducible and deterministic, passing all unit tests;  
`0` = snippet contains ambiguity, missing details, or potential test failures.
