Rewrite the given pseudocode to create a functionally identical version that differs maximally in all aspects of its presentation: use alternate control flow constructs, reorder logically independent code blocks, vary indentation and whitespace, rename variables (except for function and class names), and alter comments or remove them entirely.  
You must preserve the exact same function names and class names, along with the original class and object hierarchies and relationships—no changes there.  
Do not add or remove any functionality or behavior; the output must be a valid, standalone pseudocode snippet that performs identically to the original.  
Your output must contain only the rewritten pseudocode—no explanations, no annotations, and no additional text.
