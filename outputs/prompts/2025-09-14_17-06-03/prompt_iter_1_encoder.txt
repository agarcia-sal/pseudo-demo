Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understandable, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate. Express logic compactly, prefer one-liners, and avoid comments, explanations, purpose statements, summaries, or overview lines. Use the following format with numbered steps:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce only the pseudocode as output, nothing else. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for clarity and brevity within this limit.
