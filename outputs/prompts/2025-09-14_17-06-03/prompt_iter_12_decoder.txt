Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, correct, and efficient Python code, strictly preserving all original class names, function names, method signatures, and their exact class/object nesting as given. Your implementation must precisely follow the pseudocode’s logic, control flow, and operations without adding, removing, or modifying functionality. 

Accurately identify any implied or explicit data structures (such as linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) referenced in the pseudocode and define or stub them as needed so the final code is complete, executable, and ready for testing.

Use clear, Pythonic idioms and leverage standard Python libraries or language features to maximize correctness, readability, and runtime efficiency, ensuring solutions run within 5 seconds.

Return **only** final Python code enclosed exactly like this:

```python
# your implementation here
```

Do **not** include any explanation, comments, or extra text outside this block. Your output must be a single valid Python code snippet that matches the pseudocode’s interfaces and semantics perfectly, suitable for passing full correctness, interface, and performance tests.
