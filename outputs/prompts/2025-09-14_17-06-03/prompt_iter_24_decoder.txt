```python
You will be provided with pseudocode describing one or more classes, functions/methods, and their internal logic. Your task is to translate this pseudocode into clear, correct, and fully executable Python code, strictly adhering to the following guidelines:

- Preserve all class names, function/method names, parameter names, method signatures, and the object-oriented hierarchy exactly as in the pseudocode. Do not rename, reorder, add, or remove any of these elements.

- Faithfully implement all logic, control flow (loops, conditionals, returns), and data manipulations as specified—your code must retain the exact intended behavior without any assumptions or deviations.

- Define any referenced or implied custom types, classes, or data structures precisely as needed for the code to run independently. Definitions should be minimal yet complete, matching common conventions (e.g., ListNode for linked lists) and the problem context, without extraneous details.

- Assume inputs and outputs correspond to standard Python types unless otherwise specified. Convert or adapt data structures accordingly to match the intended interface (for example, if the pseudocode references linked list nodes, provide suitable class definitions and usage instead of plain lists).

- Strive for idiomatic, efficient, and readable Python code, using built-in functions, standard libraries, and language features where appropriate to improve performance and clarity without sacrificing correctness.

- Include necessary imports from Python’s standard library if they enhance clarity, efficiency, or correctness.

- Your final output must be enclosed solely within a single Python code block delimited by triple backticks and the keyword `python`.

- Do not include any extra explanations, comments, debugging statements, test scaffolding, or input/output code; output only the complete Python implementation.

- Ensure the translated code runs correctly and efficiently within a 5-second limit on typical inputs.

Your response must be exclusively the Python code block below, containing the complete and executable translation:

```python
# Complete Python code faithfully translated from the given pseudocode
