Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the provided problem description that faithfully preserves all class and function names exactly as given, maintaining the original class and object structure.  
Use clear, readable natural language combined with symbolic operators, abbreviations, and compact expressions to produce a brief yet understandable logic flow.  
Prefer one-line statements for control flow, assignments, and returns wherever possible, avoiding verbosity and unnecessary boilerplate.  
Do NOT write any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes — output only the pseudocode.  
Present the pseudocode in a simple numbered step format with no separator lines or markup, for example:

1. CLASS ClassName:  
2. FUNCTION functionName(params)  
3.  SET var TO value  
4.  FOR item IN collection: statement  
5.  IF condition: statement  
6.  RETURN result  
7. END FUNCTION  
8. END CLASS

Example:

FUNCTION calc_average(nums)  
 SET total TO 0  
 FOR num IN nums: total += num  
 RETURN total DIVIDED BY LENGTH(nums)  
END FUNCTION
