Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and efficient Python code. Strictly adhere to the original class names, function names, and their nesting or object structures as specified in the pseudocode. Your implementation must complete within 5 seconds and may use any standard Python library or package to enhance correctness and performance. Return only the Python code enclosed within a single, properly formatted code block using triple backticks and the `python` tag, like this:

```python
# your code here
```

Do not include any explanations, comments, or extraneous textâ€”only the Python code exactly matching the requested interfaces and logic.
