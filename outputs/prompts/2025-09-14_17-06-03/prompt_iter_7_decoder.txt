Translate the provided pseudocode into optimized, fully functional Python code. Preserve all class names, function names, and the exact class or object nesting structure as given in the pseudocode. Your implementation must be correct, efficient, and designed to run within 5 seconds. You may use any standard Python libraries or third-party packages available by default in Python environments to maximize correctness and performance.

Specifically:
- Use type-appropriate inputs matching typical usage (e.g., convert lists to linked lists if needed) when relevant to ensure your code works as expected without external assumptions.  
- Maintain idiomatic Python style and best practices, avoiding unnecessary variables or redundant constructs.  
- Handle edge cases inferred from the pseudocode and common conventions to prevent runtime errors.  
- Return *only* the complete Python code enclosed precisely within a single code block, formatted as below (with no extra text, comments, or explanations):  

```python
# Your complete code here
```

Strictly do not include commentary, explanations, notes, or test code. Your code should be ready to run in isolation, correctly implementing the pseudocodeâ€™s logic exactly as described.
