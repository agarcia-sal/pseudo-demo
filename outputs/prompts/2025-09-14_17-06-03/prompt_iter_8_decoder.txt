Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code exactly preserving all specified class names, function names, method signatures, and their nesting or object structures as given. Your implementation must strictly follow the pseudocode logic and interfaces with no additions or omissions. You may use any standard Python packages or libraries to optimize correctness and performance, ensuring the code executes within 5 seconds. Carefully handle input types as implied by the pseudocode; if the pseudocode involves custom data structures (e.g., linked lists), implement or assume them as needed for a runnable solution. Return only valid Python code enclosed in a single triple backtick code block with the python tag, like this:

```python
# your code here
```

Do not include any explanations, comments, or extra textâ€”only the Python code strictly conforming to the pseudocode and capable of passing typical tests for correctness and interface compliance.
