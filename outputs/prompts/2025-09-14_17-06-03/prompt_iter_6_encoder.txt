Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode directly from the given problem description, strictly preserving all class and function names and their original class/object hierarchy.  
Use mostly natural language phrasing blended with symbolic operators and abbreviations for compactness. Prefer single-line statements and avoid unnecessary detail or verbose syntax.  
Do not add any explanations, comments, summaries, or overview lines—output pseudocode only. Do not use separator lines or extra markup.  
Use this step-by-step numbered format starting at 1, indenting steps inside functions/classes by one tab or 4 spaces, and close blocks explicitly only if needed for clarity (e.g., END FUNCTION, END CLASS).  

Example format:  
1. FUNCTION calc_average(list_of_numbers)  
2. SET total_sum TO 0  
3. FOR each number IN list_of_numbers  
4.  INCREMENT total_sum BY number  
5. SET average_value TO total_sum DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF list_of_numbers  
6. RETURN average_value  
7. END FUNCTION
