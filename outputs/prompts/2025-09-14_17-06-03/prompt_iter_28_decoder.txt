```python
You will be given pseudocode describing classes, functions/methods, and their internal logic. Your task is to output a complete, fully executable, and efficient Python implementation that strictly preserves the exact structure, names, signatures, and logic of the pseudocode.

Please adhere precisely to the following:

- Match all class names, function/method names, parameter names, and class hierarchies exactly as in the pseudocode. Preserve method signatures and nesting as presented. Do not rename, reorder, omit, or add any elements beyond those explicitly specified.

- Translate control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, returns), data operations, and logic verbatim, ensuring the translated code reproduces the pseudocode’s intended behavior without deviation or guessing.

- If custom types (e.g., linked list nodes, tree nodes) appear in the pseudocode, provide minimal, standard Python class definitions—including appropriate type hints and dunder methods when beneficial—so the code is standalone, correct, and contextually consistent with typical problem settings.

- Treat inputs and outputs as standard Python types unless otherwise specified. Only perform conversions or wrappers (e.g., lists to linked lists) if explicitly stated or absolutely necessary for correctness.

- Use modern, idiomatic Python 3.8+ features (type annotations, dataclasses, built-in functions, standard libraries, itertools, functools, collections, heapq, typing, etc.) to maximize clarity, readability, and efficiency while strictly preserving original logic.

- Include all necessary imports at the top but only from Python’s standard library or widely accepted packages essential for correctness or efficiency.

- Your code must be executable as-is (no missing dependencies or definitions), cleanly formatted, and performant enough to run within 5 seconds on typical inputs without superfluous operations.

- Do NOT include any input/output code, testing scaffolds, debug prints, comments, explanations, or separators. The output must be ONLY the translated code.

- Enclose your entire response exclusively within a single Python code block, starting with ```python and ending with ```.

Return only that one Python code block containing the faithful and standalone Python translation of the provided pseudocode.
