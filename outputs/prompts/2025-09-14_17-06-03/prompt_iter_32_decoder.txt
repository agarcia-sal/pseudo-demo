```python
You will receive pseudocode describing classes, methods/functions, variables, and their algorithmic steps. Your task is to produce a complete, runnable Python 3.8+ module that exactly implements the pseudocode with the following strict requirements:

- Translate all classes, inheritances, methods (including nested ones), signatures (names, parameters, return types if specified), and control flow precisely as given. Retain names, order, nesting, and signatures verbatim; do NOT rename, reorder, omit, or add any elements beyond what pseudocode dictates.

- Convert pseudocode logic and syntax into clean, idiomatic Python that mirrors the original logic exactly without altering or optimizing behavior. Translate loops, conditionals, assignments, and operations 1-to-1, preserving algorithmic semantics without interpretation or inference.

- When encountering reference to custom data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees, graphs, nodes) without full implementation details, provide minimal self-contained definitions using modern Python (preferably with @dataclass and type hints). Include essential dunder methods (__init__, __repr__, __eq__ if typical) so output code is runnable and logically coherent without external dependencies.

- Use Python standard library modules and language features available in Python 3.8+ pragmatically—e.g., dataclasses, typing (including typing.Optional, typing.List, etc.), comprehensions, functools, itertools, collections—but never at the cost of fidelity to pseudocode.

- Include all necessary imports at the very top of the code block. Do not use third-party libraries; only standard library or universally accepted foundational modules are allowed.

- Avoid any form of input/output handling, testing scaffolding, debugging prints, comments, or nonessential code. The output must be a single, clean python code block demarcated by triple backticks and the keyword python (```python ... ```).

- The output must be a single self-contained Python module that can be executed as is (assuming usage context provides proper inputs) and completes execution efficiently (under 5 seconds on typical inputs).

- Your output must preserve the exact structure, naming, and semantics from the pseudocode precisely, ensuring perfect correspondence so that outputs and behavior match exactly.

- Output precisely one python code block, nothing more or less, with no extra text or explanation.

Return only the complete translated Python code block as specified.
