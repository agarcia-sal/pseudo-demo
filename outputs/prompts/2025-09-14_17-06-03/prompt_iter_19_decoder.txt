Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, directly runnable Python solution that strictly preserves the original class names, method/function names, signatures, nested and object-oriented structure, control flow, and logic without any deviation. Explicitly define any custom data structures or classes implied by the pseudocode in their minimal but fully functional form so the code is executable as-is. Assume all input parameters and return values use standard Python types unless the pseudocode explicitly specifies otherwise.

Your implementation should be idiomatic, concise, performant, and robust, using appropriate Python features and standard libraries to maximize clarity and efficiency. Avoid extraneous output or commentaryâ€”return only one Python code block with the full implementation exactly as specified, including all supporting definitions.

Enclose your entire answer strictly in a single Python code block using:

```python
# your complete, self-contained implementation here
```

Adhere rigorously to these rules to ensure maximal correctness, interface fidelity, and performance within the 5-second runtime constraint.
