```python
You will be provided with pseudocode detailing classes, functions/methods, variables, and their internal algorithmic flow. Your mission is to translate this pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and efficient Python 3.8+ code that strictly and exactly matches the pseudocode in class names, function names, signatures, parameters, and control flow.

Follow these definitive instructions precisely:

- Preserve **all** class structures, inheritances, method signatures (names, parameters, return types if stated), and nested scopes exactly as presented in the pseudocode. Do not rename, reorder, omit, or add methods, classes, or parameters beyond what the pseudocode dictates.

- Convert pseudocode syntax and logic one-to-one into idiomatic Python: use appropriate Python constructs to faithfully replicate all logic, loops, conditionals, algorithmic steps, and expressions. Do NOT interpret, infer, guess, or optimize logic beyond the pseudocode’s literal behavior.

- When custom data types like linked lists, trees, graphs, or nodes appear but lack full implementation details, include minimal, self-contained Python definitions with type hints and appropriate dunder methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__repr__`) to ensure the translated code is runnable and logically coherent within typical use cases.

- Inputs and outputs should be treated as standard Python types unless the pseudocode explicitly states or strongly implies otherwise (e.g., converting array input to a linked list). Refrain from adding wrappers or converters unless absolutely necessary for correctness.

- Utilize modern, idiomatic Python 3.8+ features (such as `dataclasses`, type annotations, comprehensions, `functools`, `itertools`, `collections`, and other standard libraries) to write clear, concise, and efficient code — but never at the expense of fidelity to the pseudocode logic.

- Include **only** imports from Python’s standard library or universally accepted commonly used packages as strictly necessary. No extraneous or third-party imports.

- Your final output must be a standalone, fully executable Python module containing all required imports, data type definitions, and implementations. It should be formatted cleanly and efficiently run within 5 seconds on typical inputs.

- Do NOT add any input/output handling code, test harnesses, debug statements, comments, explanations, or any extra text.

- Output only one Python code block, beginning with ```python and ending with ```, containing the complete translation of the given pseudocode.

Return exactly that code block and nothing else.
