Generate concise, readable, and high-level pseudocode strictly preserving all class and function names exactly as given, along with the original class and object structure. Use a compact mix of natural language and symbolic notation, favoring one-liners, abbreviations, and minimal boilerplate. Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, or extra lines—output only the pseudocode itself. Use clear and simple control flow, assignments, iterations, and returns in a terse format. Number each line sequentially, without separators or markup, following this style:

1. CLASS ClassName:  
2. FUNCTION function_name(params)  
3.  SET x ← 0  
4.  WHILE x < n: x++  
5.  RETURN result  
6. END FUNCTION  
7. END CLASS

Output must be compact, easy to follow, and maintain the exact structure and identifiers of the input code.
