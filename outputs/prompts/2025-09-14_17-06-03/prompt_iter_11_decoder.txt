Translate the given pseudocode into concise, correct, and efficient Python code, preserving all class names, function names, method signatures, and their exact nesting and object structures as specified. Your implementation must exactly follow the pseudocode’s logic, control flow, and operations without adding, omitting, or altering functionality. Use Pythonic idioms and any standard Python libraries as needed to maximize correctness, clarity, and runtime efficiency, ensuring the code runs within 5 seconds.

Accurately interpret implied data structures from the pseudocode (e.g., linked lists, trees) and implement or stub them as necessary so the solution is fully runnable and test-ready.

Return only the valid Python code enclosed in one Python-marked triple backtick block as follows:

```python
# your implementation here
```

Do not include any explanation, comments, or extra text — only the final executable Python code that strictly conforms to the pseudocode’s interfaces, logic, and structure, able to pass comprehensive correctness and interface tests.
