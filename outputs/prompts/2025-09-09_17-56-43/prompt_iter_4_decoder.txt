Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and efficient Python code. Adhere strictly to the following guidelines:

- Preserve all class names, function names, and data structure definitions exactly as presented in the pseudocode.
- The Python code must correctly implement all logic and be executable without modification.
- Use appropriate type hints where applicable to improve readability.
- You may import and utilize any standard Python libraries or modules for clarity and performance.
- Ensure your code executes within a 5-second runtime limit and is optimized accordingly.
- Carefully handle data structure construction (e.g., linked lists or trees) so input types align with expected data operations (e.g., do not assume input lists are already node-linked).
- Return only the code enclosed within a Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# translated code here
```

- Do not include any explanation, commentary, or text outside the code block.
- Do not add extraneous functions or code beyond what is required by the pseudocode unless strictly necessary for correctness or optimization.
