Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should use natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations, be compact and high-level, and avoid purpose statements, summaries, or explanatory notes. Prefer one-liners and simple control structures, with no comments or clarifications. Format steps as numbered lines, for example:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce only the pseudocode adhering to this style. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for clear, concise output within this limit.
