Generate concise, clear pseudocode directly from the problem description, preserving all original class and function names as well as data structures. Use natural language enriched with symbolic notation and abbreviations for compactness and high-level abstraction. Prefer single-line statements and simple control structures without comments, explanations, summaries, or notes. Format each step as a numbered line like:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Retain all classes and functions as in the source; inside methods, express all operations clearly and succinctly but avoid redefining structures or omitting identifiers. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Output only the pseudocode, readable and self-contained. Complete generation must finish efficiently within 5 seconds.
