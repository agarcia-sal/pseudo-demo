Generate pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be concise, easy to read, and understandable, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Prefer one-liners and high-level statements. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format precisely:

1. variable ← initial_value  
2. while condition: statement  
3. for i in range: statement  

Ensure the pseudocode is compact and clear. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for the best possible result within this limit.
