Translate the provided pseudocode into accurate, clean, and fully functional Python code. Your translation must:

- Exactly preserve all class names, function names, method signatures, and the original class/object hierarchy as specified in the pseudocode.
- Maintain variable names and data structures as close to the pseudocode as possible, only adapting names or types to Python-idiomatic forms when it is completely unambiguous and improves clarity or correctness.
- Robustly handle all input edge cases and constraints implied or stated in the pseudocode, including empty or None inputs, boundary values, and invalid scenarios.
- Faithfully implement all loops, recursion, conditionals, and control flow exactly as described, ensuring both logical correctness and optimal performance within the 5-second runtime limit.
- Add only necessary imports from the Python standard library or widely used third-party packages strictly when these imports clearly enhance correctness, readability, or runtime efficiency.
- Retain all data structures consistent with the pseudocode, including lists, sets, dictionaries, and user-defined classes, without introducing extra classes, functions, or parameters beyond those in the pseudocode.
- Use explicit type hints wherever the pseudocode suggests types; if types are not specified or ambiguous, prioritize clarity and type safety.
- Ensure correctness when translating common pseudocode constructs such as list slicing, indexing, equality, and null checks; handle Python-specific nuances like zero-based indexing and mutable default arguments carefully.
- Handle literal pseudocode values such as `null` by converting them to Python's `None`, and perform all necessary sanitization or conversion for inputs to ensure the code is runnable as-is.
- Guarantee that the code is directly executable and testable without any further edits or additions.
- Enclose the entire final code strictly within a single Python code block as follows, with no additional text, commentary, or separators outside it:

```python
# translated code here
```

- Do **not** add any explanations, debugging prints, comments outside the code block, or any extra formatting or text.
- Do not add any separator lines or headers or footers; only produce the code block.
- Strive to deliver code that maximizes passing test cases, correctness, readability, and efficiency.
