Translate the given pseudocode into robust, clean, and efficient Python code while strictly preserving all class names, function names, method signatures, and overall class/object structure exactly as provided in the pseudocode. Your translation must:

- Retain variable names and types faithful to the pseudocode unless a clearer Pythonic name or typing is unambiguous and improves readability.
- Correctly handle all boundary and edge cases implied or common to the problem (e.g., empty inputs, None values).
- Include appropriate imports from the Python standard library or well-known packages only if they enhance clarity or efficiency.
- Avoid adding or removing any classes, methods, or function parameters beyond what the pseudocode specifies.
- Implement all loops, conditions, and control flows exactly as described, ensuring logical correctness and performance.
- Enclose your entire solution in a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

- Do not add any explanation, comments outside of the code block, or extraneous text.
- Make sure the code executes within 5 seconds on typical inputs.

Deliver ONLY the Python code inside the specified code block.
