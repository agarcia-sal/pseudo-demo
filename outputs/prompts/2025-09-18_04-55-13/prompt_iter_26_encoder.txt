Translate the input code into clean, concise, and high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves all original class names, method names, and signatures exactly as they appear in the source. Reproduce classes, methods, and nested structures maintaining their original hierarchy and indentation style without alteration. Use consistent uppercase for common control flow and structural keywords such as FUNCTION, CLASS, IF, ELSE, FOR, WHILE, RETURN, SET, INCREMENT, and DECREMENT. Represent control flow, data manipulation, and algorithmic logic explicitly yet succinctly, blending standard programming terms with clear natural language to maximize readability without adding unnecessary detail or commentary. Retain original variable and parameter names unmodified unless a renaming clearly improves immediate understanding without breaking correspondence to the source. Express operations on data structures and objects faithfully, abstracting away language-specific syntax but never exposing low-level implementation details. Treat trees, graphs, linked lists, and other complex data structures as object entities with attributes and methods, not as raw primitive collections. Do not include comments, explanations, annotations, delimiters, example uses, or any text beyond the pseudocode itself. End every function and class clearly when appropriate to delineate structure without extra markers. The output must be immediately usable for understanding and reimplementation without ambiguity or guessing.
