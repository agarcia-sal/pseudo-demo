Translate the given pseudocode into robust, clean, and efficient Python code that faithfully preserves **all original class names, function names, method signatures, and the exact class/object hierarchy** as described. Your translation must:

- Keep all variable names and data types consistent with the pseudocode, only adapting them to Python idioms when this unambiguously improves clarity without altering meaning.
- Implement every control flow element exactly as specified (loops, conditionals, recursion, etc.), ensuring functional correctness and optimal performance within a 5-second runtime.
- Explicitly handle all implied or explicit edge cases, including empty, None, boundary, or invalid inputs, mirroring the pseudocode's intent.
- Retain all data structures as given (lists, sets, dicts, custom classes, etc.) without introducing new ones or changing their nature.
- Use precise type hints derived directly from the pseudocode; if unclear, prefer explicit, correct, and readable type annotations.
- Import only from Pythonâ€™s standard library or well-known, widely available third-party libraries when necessary, strictly to enhance correctness or performance.
- Not add any new classes, functions, parameters, or helper methods beyond those present in the pseudocode.
- Ensure any utility or construct function given (e.g., for building trees or linked lists) is implemented fully and works as a drop-in helper exactly as implied by the pseudocode.
- Translate special terms like `null` to `None` and any language-specific keywords or literals to their Python equivalents correctly.
- Guarantee that the output code runs without modification or external dependencies, and is ready for testing immediately.
- Enclose the complete solution in a **single** Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

- Include no explanations, comments, debug prints, separator lines, or any text outside the code block.
- Ensure structural clarity, succinctness, and correctness to maximize test-time success.

Deliver only the pristine Python code inside the specified code block, strictly following these instructions.
