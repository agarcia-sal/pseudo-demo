Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, your task is to **determine for each snippet whether it is reproducible**, meaning it can be implemented exactly as given to produce correct, consistent outputs that will pass *all* unit tests for every valid input without failure or ambiguity.

To decide reproducibility, rigorously verify that the pseudocode satisfies **all** of these critical criteria:

1. **Complete clarity and specification:**  
  - All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, and initial states are explicitly defined with no assumptions or missing details.  
  - The valid input domain and any preconditions are clearly stated or can be unambiguously inferred from the snippet alone.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous behavior:**  
  - Every operation, including control flow (conditions, loops, recursion), data manipulations, and calculations, is fully specified with precise semantics and no ambiguity.  
  - No nondeterministic elements such as randomness, timing, concurrency, or external mutable states exist.  
  - No hidden side effects, undefined behaviors, or reliance on execution environment or outside context.

3. **Complete edge case and error handling:**  
  - All valid inputs, including boundary and corner cases, exceptional inputs, and edge conditions, are explicitly addressed to avoid runtime errors, undefined results, or omissions in logic.

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:**  
  - The snippet can be implemented exactly as-is without any external dependencies such as external libraries, frameworks, global variables, hardware assumptions, configuration, or environment-specific behavior.

5. **Consistent and repeatable outputs:**  
  - For every valid input, the output is guaranteed to be the same on every execution—no variation due to hidden states, side effects, or nondeterminism.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet fully satisfies *all* above criteria, guaranteeing it will deterministically and correctly pass all unit tests on all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if it violates *any* of these criteria due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing cases, implicit dependencies, or other uncertainties or errors.  
- If multiple snippets are provided, output their results as a single concatenated string in input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or extra characters.

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding exactly to the input snippets, and nothing else.**
