Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, your task is to determine, for each snippet independently, whether it is fully reproducible—that is, whether it can be implemented exactly as written to produce **correct, deterministic, and consistent outputs that will pass all unit tests for every valid input without fail**.

To decide this, rigorously verify *all* of the following essential criteria for each snippet:

1. **Complete clarity and explicitness:** All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data types, data structures, and initial states are explicitly and unambiguously defined within the snippet. No assumptions, external context, or omitted details exist. Preconditions and valid input domains are clearly specified or inherently obvious from the pseudocode.

2. **Deterministic, unambiguous behavior:** Every step, operation, control structure, condition, loop, recursion, and calculation is clearly and precisely described with no ambiguity. The pseudocode is free from nondeterminism, randomness, hidden side effects, reliance on unspecified external or mutable state, concurrency issues, or undefined operations.

3. **Complete input domain handling:** The snippet accounts for *all* valid inputs, including normal cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios, guaranteeing correct handling with no runtime errors, infinite loops, or indeterminate behavior.

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:** The pseudocode can be implemented exactly as given without introducing dependencies on external libraries, global or environmental states, unstated assumptions, or any context outside the snippet itself.

5. **Consistent reproducibility:** For every identical input, the snippet produces the exact same output every time, ensuring deterministic, repeatable behavior that aligns with unit test expectations.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet satisfies *all* these criteria completely and without exception, guaranteeing full reproducibility and correctness across all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if it fails *any* criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, implicit or external dependencies, or any other gap preventing guaranteed correctness.

- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results as a single concatenated string, preserving their input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or other characters.

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input snippets, and nothing else.**
