Evaluate each provided pseudocode snippet enclosed below to determine if it is fully reproducible with absolute certainty. A snippet is **fully reproducible** if any correct, faithful implementation based solely on it will **always pass all unit tests for every valid input**, producing correct, deterministic outputs without fail.

For **each snippet**, decide based on strict, comprehensive criteria:

1. **Exhaustive definition:** All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, initialization steps, data structures, and preconditions are explicitly and completely defined with zero ambiguity or hidden assumptions.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic execution:** The logic, including all control flow (loops, recursion, conditionals) and operations, is precisely described without randomness, side effects, external dependencies, partial definitions, or undefined behaviors.

3. **Complete input domain coverage:** Correct handling of every possible valid input, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional or corner cases, ensuring no omissions that could cause failure or undefined results.

4. **Fully self-contained:** No reliance on any external context, states, libraries, or environment beyond what is included explicitly in the snippet.

5. **Deterministic and stable output:** Running any implementation derived from the snippet multiple times with identical inputs must always yield exactly the same outputs.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each snippet, output exactly one character:  
 - `1` if the snippet fulfills **all** above criteria, guaranteeing reproducible, fully correct behavior unconditionally.  
 - `0` otherwise—if any ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case, external dependency, or uncertainty exists.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results concatenated in the order given, without spaces, newlines, or additional characters.

**OUTPUT ONLY the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s.** No explanations, no formatting, no whitespace—nothing besides the sequence of digits corresponding exactly to the input snippets order.
