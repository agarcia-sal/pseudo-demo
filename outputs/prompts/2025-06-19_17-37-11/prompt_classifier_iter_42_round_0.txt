Given one or more pseudocode snippets delimited below, determine for each snippet if it is **fully reproducible**, meaning that **any faithful implementation of that snippet will always produce correct, deterministic outputs passing all valid unit tests for every possible input in the problem domain without exception.**

To decide reproducibility, verify **all** these criteria are met **unconditionally** for each snippet:

1. **Exhaustive completeness:** The snippet fully defines all inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, initialization states, and preconditions, with no missing or ambiguous elements or hidden assumptions.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous operations:** Every step—including all control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion), computations, and invoked procedures—is described precisely and explicitly, with zero ambiguity, randomness, nondeterminism, or external mutable state dependencies.

3. **Correctness on the entire input domain:** The snippet guarantees fully defined and correct behavior for every valid input, including all edge and corner cases, exceptional or boundary values, and degenerate conditions, without undefined or partial behavior.

4. **Self-contained and context-free:** The snippet requires no external information, environments, or assumptions beyond what is fully presented, making it immediately implementable exactly as given.

5. **Consistent reproducible outputs:** Any implementation strictly following the snippet will yield deterministic, identical outputs on repeated runs with identical inputs, passing all unit tests without fail.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each given pseudocode snippet, output exactly one single digit:  
 - `1` if the snippet meets **all** above conditions and guarantees reproducible correctness.  
 - `0` if it fails **any** one or more conditions due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing test coverage, implicit or external dependencies, or uncertainty.  
- When multiple snippets are input, output their corresponding digits concatenated immediately, with no spaces, new lines, or any other characters.

**Output nothing else. No explanations, no formatting, no whitespace, and no extra content beyond the concatenated string of 1s and 0s.**
