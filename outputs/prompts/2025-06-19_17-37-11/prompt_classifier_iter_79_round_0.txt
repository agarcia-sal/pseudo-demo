Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, for each snippet, determine with absolute certainty whether it is fully reproducible—that is, whether it can be directly implemented exactly as given to produce consistently correct outputs that pass all unit tests on every valid input, without any ambiguity or failure.

To do this, rigorously verify the following criteria for each snippet:

1. **Complete and precise definition:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial conditions are explicitly and unambiguously defined within the snippet itself. No information is missing, implied, or depends on external context. Input domains or preconditions are clearly stated or inferable without guesswork.

2. **Deterministic and precise logic:** Every operation, control flow decision (conditions, loops, recursion), and data manipulation is explicitly and unambiguously described. There is no dependence on randomness, external or hidden state, side effects, or any behavior that can vary between executions with the same inputs.

3. **Full input domain and edge case handling:** The pseudocode explicitly accounts for every valid input, including all boundary cases, exceptional inputs, or corner scenarios. No inputs lead to undefined behavior, runtime errors, or partial/incorrect results.

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:** The snippet requires no external libraries, system state, global variables, user input outside the defined inputs, or contextual assumptions beyond the pseudocode itself.

5. **Consistent and reproducible outputs:** Given identical inputs, the snippet’s outputs are guaranteed to be the same every time, ensuring deterministic reproducibility and passing all unit tests that expect consistent results.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if all five criteria above are fully met, guaranteeing correctness and reproducibility under all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if any criterion is violated, including ambiguity, omission, nondeterminism, incompleteness, or dependency on external context.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results as a single concatenated string in the exact order the snippets appear.  
- Output strictly no other text, spaces, explanations, or formatting beyond this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s.
