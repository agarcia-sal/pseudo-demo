Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, **for each snippet, determine if it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be precisely implemented as-is to always produce correct, deterministic outputs that pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input without exception.** Your evaluation must strictly consider the following critical factors:

1. **Unambiguous completeness:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, initial state, and allowed input domain is explicitly and clearly defined within the snippet itself. No assumptions or external contextual knowledge are permitted.

2. **Deterministic, explicit logic:** All control flows, operations, and data manipulations are described in detail, free of ambiguity, randomness, hidden side effects, or external dependencies. Behavior must be consistent and reproducible on every run.

3. **Comprehensive validity handling:** All valid inputs—including edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional situations—are explicitly accounted for and correctly handled, ensuring no undefined behavior or runtime errors occur.

4. **Self-sufficiency and environment independence:** The pseudocode must be fully self-contained; it cannot rely on external libraries, global states, environment-specific behavior, or any context not fully included in the snippet.

5. **Guaranteed consistency:** For identical inputs, the output is always exactly the same, guaranteeing deterministic results and reproducible unit test success every time.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if *all* above criteria are met perfectly, guaranteeing reproducibility across all inputs and environments.  
  - `0` if *any* criterion fails—even if only partially—due to ambiguity, omissions, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, hidden dependencies, or any uncertainty affecting correctness or reproducibility.  
- If multiple snippets are present, output their results as a single concatenated string, preserving input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other characters.

**Respond only with this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input snippets, and nothing else.**
