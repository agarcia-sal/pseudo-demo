Analyze the given pseudocode snippet(s) carefully and determine if each one is fully reproducible—meaning that any exact, faithful implementation of it will pass every valid unit test for all possible inputs within the problem scope without exception.

To evaluate reproducibility, ensure that each snippet meets all these stringent requirements:

1. **Explicit and exhaustive detail:**  
 - Every input, output, variable, constant, data structure, and function call is explicitly defined with clear, unambiguous types or descriptions.  
 - All initializations, preconditions, and environment assumptions necessary for correctness are completely specified. No implicit or missing information.

2. **Deterministic and precise logic:**  
 - All computational steps, control structures (conditionals, loops, recursion), and data manipulations have one clear, unambiguous meaning.  
 - The pseudocode uses no randomness, external or hidden states, approximate operations, side effects, or nondeterminism.

3. **Complete input domain coverage:**  
 - The snippet explicitly or logically handles all valid inputs, including normal, boundary, edge, and exceptional cases, without undefined or erroneous behavior or omissions.

4. **Self-contained and context-free:**  
 - The snippet is fully self-sufficient; it does not rely on any external knowledge, assumptions, or environment not explicitly stated in the pseudocode itself.

5. **Clear for direct implementation:**  
 - A programmer can implement the snippet exactly as given and produce consistent, correct outputs on every run for identical inputs without guesswork or added interpretation.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided as input, output a single digit:  
 - **1** if the snippet satisfies *all* above criteria and is therefore reproducible.  
 - **0** if it fails *any* criterion.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output the digits concatenated in the exact order the snippets appear.  
- Output nothing else—not even spaces, line breaks, explanations, or formatting.
