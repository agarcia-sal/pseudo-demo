Evaluate each pseudocode snippet enclosed below to determine if it is **unconditionally reproducible**. Reproducible means that **any correct and faithful implementation derived from the snippet will deterministically produce outputs that pass all valid unit tests, across every possible input in the defined problem domain, without exception or failure.**

To confirm reproducibility for each snippet, you must verify all these stringent criteria are met absolutely and unconditionally:

1. **Complete specification:** The snippet explicitly defines *all* inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, initial states, and problem constraints—no implicit assumptions, no omitted details, and no ambiguities remain.

2. **Deterministic, precise logic:** All operations, control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion), calculations, and calls are described explicitly and unambiguously; there is no allowance for randomness, nondeterminism, external mutable state, or interpretation variance.

3. **Exhaustive correctness:** The snippet’s logic handles *every possible valid input*—including edge cases, boundary values, degenerate or exceptional inputs—fully and correctly; no partial, undefined, or undefined behavior exists anywhere.

4. **Self-contained and context-independent:** The snippet requires no external data, environment, or assumptions beyond what is fully stated. It is a standalone, immediately implementable description.

5. **Guaranteed, consistent outputs:** Following the snippet precisely always yields identical, deterministic outputs on repeated runs with identical inputs, passing all comprehensive unit tests without any exceptions or failures.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one digit only:  
 - `1` if the snippet satisfies *all* conditions and unconditionally guarantees reproducibility  
 - `0` if it fails *any* condition (due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing coverage for any input, reliance on external context, uncertain behavior, or any other flaw)  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output a concatenated string of digits in the same order, with no spaces, line breaks, or other characters.

Output nothing else. No explanations, no formatting, no whitespace, no extra content—only the exact concatenated string of 1s and 0s corresponding to the snippets' reproducibility.
