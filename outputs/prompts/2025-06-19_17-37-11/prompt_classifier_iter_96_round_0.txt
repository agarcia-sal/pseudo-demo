Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet **whether it is fully reproducible**, meaning it can be implemented exactly as presented to produce correct, deterministic results that pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input—without any ambiguity, omission, or need for assumptions.

Your assessment must rigorously confirm that each snippet satisfies **all** of the following criteria:

1. **Explicit Completeness:** Every element—including all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initializations, and assumptions—is explicitly and completely specified, leaving no gaps or implicit requirements. Input constraints and the domain are clearly addressed or logically deducible.

2. **Precise, Unambiguous Logic:** All computations, control flows (conditionals, loops, recursion), and data manipulations are described in exact, unequivocal terms. The snippet contains no randomization, hidden states, external dependencies, side effects, or undefined behavior. The logic is deterministic and fully clear.

3. **Full Coverage of Valid Inputs:** The pseudocode accounts for every possible valid input scenario, including boundary cases and exceptions, ensuring no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined results occur under any legitimate input.

4. **Complete Self-Sufficiency:** The snippet is self-contained and independent—it does not require or reference external libraries, global variables, environment-specific features, or unstated context. All necessary information for implementation is contained within the snippet.

5. **Consistent Reproducibility:** Given the same inputs, the snippet always produces the same outputs without any variability or nondeterminism, guaranteeing reliable, repeatable success on all unit tests.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character as follows:  
  - `1` if the snippet unconditionally meets *all five* criteria above, guaranteeing flawless, reproducible implementation and passing of all unit tests on all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if it fails *any* criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing input coverage, external dependencies, or any uncertainty or error source.  
- If multiple snippets are provided, concatenate their results in the order given, with no spaces, newlines, or extra characters.

**Strictly output only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s, nothing else.**
