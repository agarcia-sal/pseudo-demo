Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **fully reproducible**, meaning it can be implemented exactly as provided to produce correct, deterministic outputs that will pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input, without requiring any assumptions, clarifications, or external information.

To decide this, rigorously verify that each snippet meets **all** these comprehensive, non-negotiable criteria:

1. **Explicit Completeness:** Every element—inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initialization states, and edge cases—is explicitly and unambiguously defined. Input constraints, preconditions, and postconditions are either stated clearly or logically derivable solely from the snippet.

2. **Precise, Deterministic Logic:** Each step, operation, decision, and calculation is described in precise, unambiguous terms, ensuring deterministic behavior without randomness, concurrency issues, external dependencies, hidden side effects, or undefined operations.

3. **Total Input Domain Coverage:** The snippet’s logic handles *all* valid inputs fully, including boundary conditions, unusual or minimal cases, and potential exceptions, guaranteeing no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined behavior can occur for any valid input.

4. **Context and Dependency Independence:** The snippet stands alone, requiring no external libraries, frameworks, global or external state, environmental factors, or unstated assumptions. It must be directly implementable exactly as-is in isolation.

5. **Consistent, Reproducible Outputs:** Given identical inputs, the snippet produces exactly the same outputs consistently, with no variability or nondeterminism, assuring reliable, repeatable unit test success.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet satisfies *all five* of the above criteria perfectly, guaranteeing that an exact implementation will deterministically pass every unit test on all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if the snippet fails *any* criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing input coverage, external dependency, or any uncertainty that compromises guaranteed correctness.  
- If multiple snippets are provided, output the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s in the input order, with no spaces, newlines, or other characters.

**Your output must contain only this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s, nothing else—no explanations, comments, or formatting.**
