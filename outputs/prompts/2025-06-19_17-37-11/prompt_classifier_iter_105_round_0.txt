Given one or more pseudocode snippets presented below, determine for each snippet whether it is **fully reproducible**, meaning it can be implemented exactly as written to produce correct, consistent results that will pass *all* unit tests for *all* valid inputs without error or ambiguity.

Assess each snippet rigorously according to these enhanced, comprehensive criteria:

1. **Explicit and Complete Definition:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, and initial state must be precisely and fully defined. No information required to implement or test the snippet is implicit, missing, or vague. If constraints or assumptions are necessary, they must be clearly stated or indisputably derivable from the code itself.

2. **Precise, Unambiguous Logic:** Each operation, control structure, data manipulation, and computation must be described clearly and deterministically, with no possibility of multiple interpretations, randomness, side effects, or dependency on external or hidden state.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage and Robustness:** The snippet must guarantee correct behavior for every possible valid input—including edge cases and boundary values—explicitly or by logical inference. It must account for exceptional or boundary conditions to ensure no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined behavior can occur.

4. **Strict Self-Containment:** The snippet must be fully self-sufficient, containing all necessary logic, declarations, and definitions. It must have no reliance on external libraries, global variables, environment state, or information beyond what is provided explicitly within the snippet.

5. **Deterministic, Reproducible Output:** Identical inputs must always yield exactly the same outputs with zero variability. The snippet’s execution outcome is entirely predictable and repeatable, ensuring guaranteed success across all unit tests.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet meets *all five* criteria without exception, ensuring flawless, reproducible functionality for *every* valid input.  
  - `0` if the snippet fails any criteria—due to missing, ambiguous, nondeterministic, incomplete, or externally dependent elements, or incomplete input handling.  
- If multiple snippets are given, output their evaluation characters concatenated in the order presented, with no spaces, line breaks, or any other characters.

**Important:** Output only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s. Provide no explanations, comments, or extra text.
