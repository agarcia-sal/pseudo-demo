Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, determine for each snippet whether it is **fully reproducible**, defined as guaranteeing that **any correct implementation adhering strictly to the snippet will produce correct, deterministic outputs passing all valid unit tests for every possible input in the problem domain, without exception.**

Evaluate each snippet rigorously under these five precise, cumulative criteria—only output `1` if all criteria are met; otherwise, output `0`:

1. **Complete formal specification:** The snippet unambiguously and exhaustively specifies all inputs, outputs, intermediate variables, constants, data structures, initializations, and any necessary environmental conditions or preconditions. There are no implicit assumptions, missing components, or undefined elements.

2. **Deterministic, explicit behavior:** Every operation, including control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion), calculations, and calls to other procedures (if any), is fully defined without ambiguity, nondeterminism, probabilistic elements, or reliance on external mutable state or hidden side effects.

3. **Total correctness over the entire valid input space:** The snippet guarantees well-defined, correct, and complete behavior over every possible valid input—covering standard, boundary, edge, and degenerate cases—without exceptions, partial definitions, or undefined states.

4. **Context independence and self-sufficiency:** The snippet requires no external context, resources, environment, or assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated; it is immediately implementable exactly as presented.

5. **Reproducible and consistent outputs:** Any faithful implementation strictly following the snippet will produce identical, deterministic outputs on repeated executions with identical inputs, passing all corresponding unit tests exhaustively and consistently.

**Output requirements:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one single digit:  
 `1` if **all five** criteria are satisfied, meaning guaranteed reproducibility;  
 `0` otherwise.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their `1` or `0` digits concatenated in order, **without any spaces, line breaks, or extra characters.**

**Output nothing else—no explanations, no formatting, no whitespace, no supplementary text.**
