Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, determine for each snippet **whether it is fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests for every valid input without fail**. Your determination must be based solely on the snippet’s content by rigorously verifying all the criteria below:

1. **Complete and explicit specification:** The snippet must explicitly define all inputs, outputs, internal variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and any necessary preconditions or assumptions—leaving no information implicit, vague, or missing.

2. **Fully deterministic and unambiguous logic:** Each operation, decision, iteration, and data manipulation step must be precisely stated with no room for interpretation, randomness, reliance on external mutable state, or undefined behavior under any circumstances.

3. **Exhaustive correctness for all valid inputs:** The snippet must demonstrate handling of every possible valid input scenario—including normal cases, edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional or corner cases—ensuring correct and fully defined output in every situation.

4. **Self-contained and implementation-agnostic:** The pseudocode must be independently implementable without dependencies on external libraries, external states, omitted context, or hidden assumptions beyond what is presented.

5. **Guaranteed consistent output:** Any faithful implementation strictly following the snippet must produce identical, reproducible outputs for the same input every run, ensuring consistent unit test outcomes.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet satisfies **all five** criteria above completely, guaranteeing reproducible correctness and consistent unit test passing.  
  - `0` if it fails **any one or more** of these criteria due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, implicit dependencies, or any uncertainty.  
- When multiple snippets are input, output their results as a concatenated string in the order given, with no spaces, line breaks, explanations, or any other characters.

**Respond only with the resulting string of `1`s and `0`s. No additional text, commentary, or formatting.**
