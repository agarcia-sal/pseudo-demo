Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, for **each snippet independently**, determine whether it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as provided to produce correct, consistent, and fully deterministic outputs, passing all unit tests for every valid input without fail. Your judgment must be based solely on the pseudocode content and rigorously verify **all** the following aspects:

1. **Complete explicit definition:** Every element used in the pseudocode—inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and assumptions—is clearly and unambiguously specified. There are no missing definitions, implicit knowledge, or context required outside the snippet.

2. **Unambiguous and deterministic behavior:** All operations, control flows (conditionals, loops, recursion), data transformations, and calculations must be described precisely and solely in terms of deterministic steps. No randomness, nondeterminism, external or hidden state, side effects, or undefined behaviors may be present.

3. **Comprehensive handling of all valid inputs:** The logic must explicitly or clearly handle every possible valid input, including edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios, guaranteeing no runtime errors or undefined results for any valid input.

4. **Self-contained and dependency-free:** The snippet must be runnable as-is without requiring any external libraries, frameworks, global or environmental variables, or additional context beyond what is given.

5. **Guaranteed reproducibility and consistency:** Running the same inputs multiple times must yield exactly the same outputs, making it fully deterministic and stable for unit testing.

**Output requirements:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character as follows:  
  - `1` if and only if **all** of the above criteria are met perfectly, ensuring guaranteed reproducibility and unit test success for every valid input.  
  - `0` if the snippet fails **any** criterion, due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, uncovered edge cases, implicit dependencies, or other uncertainty or errors.  
- When multiple snippets are input, output their results as a single concatenated string reflecting the snippets’ input order without spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other text.

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding exactly to the order of the input snippets, and nothing else.**
