Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **guaranteed reproducible**—meaning that any faithful implementation of the snippet will always produce a correct, fully deterministic solution passing **all valid unit tests for every possible input** in its problem domain, without fail.

For each snippet, verify **all** the following strictly hold **unconditionally**:

1. **Complete and explicit specification:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, preconditions, and initializations are fully defined and unambiguous; no hidden assumptions, missing details, or implicit dependencies exist.

2. **Deterministic and precise operations:** Each step of the snippet—including control flow (conditionals, loops, recursion), computations, and function calls—is described unequivocally with no ambiguity, randomness, side effects, or dependencies on external or mutable states.

3. **Exhaustive input coverage and correctness:** The snippet explicitly or implicitly ensures well-defined, correct behavior on **every valid input** including edge cases (empty inputs, minimal/maximal bounds, null values, exceptional conditions), guaranteeing no undefined, partial, or incorrect outputs.

4. **Fully self-contained and implementable:** The snippet requires no external context, supplemental information, environment assumptions, or hidden states beyond what is provided; it can be implemented exactly as given without external references.

5. **Reproducible and consistent outputs:** Running any faithful implementation of the snippet on the same input always yields the same correct output, reliably passing all unit tests by design.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
 - `1` if **all** the above conditions are fully satisfied and reproducibility is guaranteed.  
 - `0` if **any** condition is violated, including ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing cases, implicit assumptions, or any uncertainty.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their corresponding digits concatenated **directly, with no spaces, line breaks, or extra characters**.  

**No explanations, clarifications, formatting, whitespace, or any characters beyond the required concatenated digits are allowed.**
