Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet if it is fully **reproducible**—meaning any faithful implementation derived from it will always produce a correct, deterministic solution that passes **all valid unit tests for every possible input** in its problem domain without exception.

For each snippet, output `1` only if **all** these criteria are unquestionably met:

1. **Explicit and complete definition:** The snippet explicitly defines all necessary inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and any preconditions, leaving no detail implicit, undefined, or ambiguous.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic logic:** Every step of the algorithm—including control flow constructs, calculations, recursive or iterative processes, and function or method calls—is described clearly and precisely, free from randomness, side effects, external dependencies, or any form of nondeterminism.

3. **Comprehensive correctness across inputs:** The snippet accounts for every valid input in the problem domain, including all edge, boundary, and special cases, ensuring the output is always well-defined, correct, and valid without exceptions, undefined behavior, or partial solutions.

4. **Self-contained and fully implementable:** All information and logic needed to implement the snippet exactly as intended is included; the snippet depends on no external context, environment assumptions, or hidden states beyond what is presented.

5. **Consistent, reproducible output:** No matter how many times or where the snippet is implemented, executing it on the same input always yields the same correct output, guaranteeing it passes all unit tests that validate its specification.

If **any** of these conditions are not strictly and unconditionally met, output `0` for that snippet.

**Output format:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one digit:  
 `1` if the snippet meets all the reproducibility criteria above;  
 `0` otherwise.  
- If multiple snippets are provided in order, output their digits concatenated **directly** without spaces, line breaks, or any additional characters.

**Do not output anything else—no explanations, clarifications, whitespace, punctuation, or formatting beyond the required concatenated digits.**
