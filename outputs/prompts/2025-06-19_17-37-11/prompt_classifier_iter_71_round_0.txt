Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, **for each snippet, determine whether it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as written to produce correct, consistent outputs that pass all unit tests for every valid input without exception.**

To decide this, rigorously verify that each snippet meets *all* of the following comprehensive conditions:

1. **Explicit completeness:** Inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial conditions are exhaustively and precisely specified. No implicit assumptions, missing definitions, or external context are required. The valid input domain and any preconditions are clearly stated or inherently unambiguous.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous operations:** Every action, including control flow (conditionals, loops, recursion), data manipulation, and computation, is defined without ambiguity or vagueness. The snippet contains no randomness, hidden side effects, external dependencies, concurrency, or undefined behavior.

3. **Total and robust input coverage:** The logic explicitly and correctly handles all possible valid inputs, edge cases, and exceptional or boundary conditions. No scenarios within the valid domain can cause failure, undefined results, or runtime errors.

4. **Self-sufficiency and isolation:** The snippet stands alone with no reliance on external functions, libraries, environment variables, global or mutable state, or assumptions about execution context beyond what is provided.

5. **Invariant output consistency:** For any identical input, the snippet's output is guaranteed to be identical every time, with no nondeterministic variance affecting correctness.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if **all criteria above are fully satisfied**, ensuring the snippet will deterministically and correctly pass *every* unit test for all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if **any criterion is violated or uncertain**, due to ambiguity, missing elements, nondeterminism, incomplete handling, implicit assumptions, or other flaws impacting guaranteed correctness or reproducibility.  
- If multiple snippets are given, output their respective results as a single uninterrupted string of `1`s and `0`s, exactly in the same order they are provided.  
- Output nothing else—not explanations, spaces, or newlines.

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding precisely to the input snippets, and nothing else.**
