Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand. Use clear natural language combined with common symbolic operators (←, ==, !=, <, ≤, >, ≥, +, -, *, /, %, ++, --) for assignments, comparisons, and arithmetic. Focus on compactness and natural phrasing without sacrificing clarity.

Guidelines:

- Begin each function with:  
  `in function <name>`

- Declare variables and data structures simply:  
  `let x be integer`  
  `let A be vector of integers`  
  `set size of A = n`

- Express input/output and data operations directly and compactly:  
  `read n`  
  `read n elements into A`  
  `print all elements of A`

- Prefer one-line statements whenever clear. Use indentation only to show logical blocks in loops or conditionals that cannot fit naturally in one line.

- Use concise loops and conditionals with clear, natural phrasing, and inline conditions if it improves readability, e.g.,  
  `while x < n: x++`  
  `for i in 0 to size of A - 2:`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`set min_i ← i`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`for j in i+1 to size of A - 1: set min_i ← j if A[j] < A[min_i]`  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`swap A[i], A[min_i]`

- Use natural descriptive variable names; abbreviations allowed only if clear.

- Do NOT include any comments, explanations, summaries, or additional text beyond the pseudocode lines.

- Number every output line starting at 1, with no blank lines or separators.

- Combine logically connected steps compactly but do not sacrifice readability or structural clarity.

Example output style:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for i in 0 to size of A - 2:  
8.   set min_i ← i  
9.   for j in i+1 to size of A - 1: set min_i ← j if A[j] < A[min_i]  
10.   swap A[i], A[min_i]  
11. print all elements of A

Produce only the minimal set of lines strictly corresponding to the input code behavior using this style, balancing natural language and symbolic brevity for maximum clarity and conciseness.
