Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine **whether each snippet is fully reproducible**, meaning it can be flawlessly implemented exactly as presented to produce correct, deterministic outputs that will pass *all* unit tests over *every* valid input, without ambiguity, omissions, or external assumptions.

To decide, rigorously verify that each snippet meets **all** of these essential criteria:

1. **Explicit Completeness:** Every element needed—inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and all operational details—must be fully specified with no gaps or implicit assumptions. All necessary input constraints or domain specifications are clearly stated or logically deducible from the snippet itself.

2. **Precise and Deterministic Semantics:** The logic, including all control flows (conditionals, loops, recursion), operations, and data manipulations, must be unambiguous, deterministic, and free of any randomness, side effects, external state dependencies, or undefined behavior.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage:** The snippet must robustly handle every valid input scenario, including typical, boundary, edge, and exceptional cases explicitly or implicitly, ensuring no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined outcomes occur for any lawful input.

4. **Complete Self-Containment:** The snippet does not depend on any unstated context, external/global variables, external libraries, environment-specific factors, or hidden prerequisites. It is fully implementable as-is without supplementing information.

5. **Consistent and Reproducible Output:** For identical inputs, the snippet always produces exactly the same outputs, guaranteeing deterministic, repeatable unit test results.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each snippet, output a single character:  
  - `1` if and only if it satisfies *all five criteria* perfectly, ensuring guaranteed reproducibility and passing all unit tests for all valid inputs.  
  - `0` otherwise, if it fails any criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, incomplete input handling, external dependencies, or any uncertainty.  
- If multiple snippets are given, output their results concatenated in order, with no spaces, newlines, or extra characters.

**Your output must be only this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s. Nothing else.**
