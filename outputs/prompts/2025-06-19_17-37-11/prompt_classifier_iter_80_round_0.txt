Given one or more pseudocode snippets delimited below, **determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as presented to produce correct, consistent outputs that pass all unit tests for every valid input without exception**. Evaluate each snippet against the following rigorous, non-negotiable criteria:

1. **Complete clarity and explicitness:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, and initial condition must be unambiguously specified within the snippet. No implicit assumptions, external context, or missing definitions are allowed. Preconditions and the full domain of valid inputs must be explicitly stated or clearly inferable from the snippet itself.

2. **Precise, deterministic behavior:** All control flow (including branches, loops, recursion), data transformations, and calculations must be described clearly and completely, without ambiguity. The snippet must not contain any source of nondeterminism (e.g., randomness, concurrency, or side effects), hidden or external state dependencies, or undefined behaviors.

3. **Exhaustive handling of all valid inputs:** The snippet’s logic must explicitly and correctly address every relevant edge case, boundary condition, invalid or exceptional input scenario within the defined input domain, ensuring no input leads to errors, infinite loops, undefined results, or partial behavior.

4. **Self-contained and context-free:** The snippet must be implementable exactly as presented without dependencies on any external libraries, global or hidden variables, runtime environment features, or assumptions beyond what is included within the snippet.

5. **Consistent and repeatable results:** For the same input, the snippet must reliably yield the same output on every execution, guaranteeing reproducible unit test outcomes regardless of runtime or environment variations.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For **each** pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if **all** above criteria are fully met without exception, ensuring guaranteed deterministic correctness and unit test success for every valid input.  
  - `0` if **any** criterion is violated—due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterministic elements, missing edge case handling, implicit or external dependencies, or any other uncertainty or defect.

- When multiple snippets are given, output their corresponding results as a single concatenated string, preserving input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or additional characters.

- **Respond only with this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s, nothing else.**
