Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine with absolute certainty whether each snippet is **fully reproducible**—meaning that any direct, faithful implementation of the pseudocode will pass **every valid unit test** for all possible inputs in the defined problem space, without failure or ambiguity.

For each snippet, **output 1** if and only if the snippet unconditionally meets all of the following:

- **Explicit completeness:** Inputs, outputs, variables, constants, and data structures are fully specified with clear, unambiguous types or descriptions. All initial conditions, preconditions, and setup steps are explicitly stated with no hidden assumptions.

- **Deterministic and precise operations:** Every operation and control structure (including function calls, loops, conditionals, and recursion) is defined with exact, deterministic behavior—no randomness, external dependencies, or side effects outside the snippet.

- **Exhaustive input coverage:** The snippet explicitly handles all valid inputs, including typical cases, edge cases (empty, null, minimal, maximal), and exceptional conditions; no inputs lead to undefined, inconsistent, or erroneous outcomes.

- **Context-independent self-containment:** The snippet contains all information needed for correct implementation and execution without requiring any external, unstated knowledge, environment, or implementation details.

- **Implementation clarity and reproducibility:** The pseudocode is sufficiently detailed so that any competent programmer can produce an implementation yielding the exact correct behavior on every run with identical inputs.

If the snippet fails **any one or more** of these conditions for reproducibility (e.g., ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, partial input handling, implicit assumptions), output **0**.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output a single digit with no spaces, line breaks, extra characters, or explanations:  
 - **1** = fully reproducible  
 - **0** = not reproducible  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their digits concatenated **in the order given**.
