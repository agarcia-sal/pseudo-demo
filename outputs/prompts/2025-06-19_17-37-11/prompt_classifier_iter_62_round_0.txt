Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, your task is to evaluate *each snippet independently* and determine if it is fully reproducible—meaning it can be implemented exactly as provided to consistently produce correct outputs that pass all unit tests for every valid input without exception.

To decide, **rigorously assess each snippet against the following explicit, non-negotiable criteria:**

1. **Comprehensive Input/Output Definition:** All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, and initial states must be explicitly and unambiguously defined within the pseudocode. No external assumptions, missing details, or implicit contexts are allowed. Valid input domains and preconditions must be fully specified or clearly inferable without guesswork.

2. **Precise and Unambiguous Logic:** Every computational step, including assignments, control-flow (conditionals, loops, recursion), calculations, and data manipulations, must be clearly and deterministically stated, leaving no room for multiple interpretations or undefined behavior. The snippet must not rely on randomness, concurrency, hidden side effects, or external mutable states.

3. **Robust Edge Case and Exception Coverage:** The snippet’s logic must explicitly handle all edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional or corner inputs within the valid input space to guarantee correctness and prevent any runtime errors or undefined outputs.

4. **Complete Self-Containment and Environment Independence:** The snippet must be fully implementable as-is without requiring any external libraries, frameworks, global variables, environment states, or contextual information beyond what is explicitly provided in the snippet.

5. **Deterministic and Repeatable Outputs:** For any given valid input, the snippet must produce the exact same output every time it executes, ensuring perfect reproducibility and reliable unit test success.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if all of the above criteria are met in full with zero exceptions; the snippet is guaranteed to deterministically and correctly pass all unit tests for all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if the snippet fails *any* single criterion, due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, implicit dependencies, undefined behavior, or other issues compromising reproducibility.  

- When multiple snippets are given, concatenate their outputs **in the exact order they appear in the input**, producing a single string of `1`s and `0`s with no spaces, line breaks, explanations, or additional characters.

**Respond ONLY with this concise, concatenated binary string and nothing else.**
