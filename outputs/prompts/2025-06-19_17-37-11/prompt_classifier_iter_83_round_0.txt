Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, evaluate each snippet rigorously and output a single digit per snippet indicating whether it is strictly reproducible (`1`) or not (`0`). A snippet is reproducible if and only if it can be implemented exactly as given to produce correct, deterministic, and consistent outputs that pass every unit test for all valid inputs without exception.

To decide, apply the following criteria **exhaustively** to each snippet:

1. **Complete definition of all elements:** All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, initial states, and any assumptions are explicitly and unambiguously defined within the snippet. No element is left implicit or referenced outside the snippet.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic logic:** Every step, operation, condition, loop, recursion, and calculation is described clearly and precisely, without reliance on randomness, external/mutable state, side effects, or undefined behavior.

3. **Comprehensive input domain handling:** The pseudocode explicitly accounts for every possible valid input scenario, including boundary and edge cases, exceptional conditions, and special values—ensuring no input leads to runtime errors, omissions, or undefined results.

4. **Fully self-contained and context-free:** The snippet requires no external dependencies such as libraries, global variables, environment states, or hidden contexts not included in the snippet itself.

5. **Consistent and repeatable outputs:** The pseudocode guarantees that for the same input, the outputs will always be identical in every implementation, enabling reliable, repeatable unit test success.

**Output instructions:**   
- For each snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if all criteria above hold simultaneously without any ambiguity or exception.  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their results as a single concatenated string **in the same order** with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or other characters.

Your response must **only** contain this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the provided pseudocode snippets.
