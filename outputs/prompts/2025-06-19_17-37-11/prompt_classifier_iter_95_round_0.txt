Evaluate each provided pseudocode snippet to determine if it is strictly **reproducible**, defined as fully implementable *as-is* to reliably and deterministically pass **all** unit tests across **all** valid inputs without exception, ambiguity, or assumption.

To assess reproducibility, verify that each snippet meets *all* of the following rigorous criteria:

1. **Exact and Complete Definition:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, and initial state is explicitly and exhaustively specified. Input constraints and assumptions must be clearly stated or directly derivable from the pseudocode with no ambiguity or missing information.

2. **Precise, Deterministic, and Unambiguous Procedures:** All instructions, control flows (including conditionals, loops, recursion), operations, and calculations are fully and explicitly described with deterministic semantics—no randomness, hidden states, side effects, or undefined behaviors present anywhere.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage and Robustness:** The logic systematically and explicitly handles every legitimate input scenario—normal cases, boundary conditions, edge cases, and error states—ensuring no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined results for any allowed input.

4. **Complete Self-Sufficiency and Isolation:** The snippet is autonomously executable based solely on the provided pseudocode, without requiring external functions, libraries, global or environmental variables, or implicit context outside the snippet itself.

5. **Stable, Deterministic Output Consistency:** Repeated executions with identical inputs must always yield the exact same outputs, guaranteeing deterministic reproducibility and passing all corresponding unit tests without fail.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet analyzed, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet fully satisfies *all five* criteria, guaranteeing correct, deterministic, and complete reproducibility under *all* valid inputs.  
  - `0` otherwise, if the snippet fails any criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, external dependencies, or any source of uncertainty or inconsistency.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results concatenated sequentially in the order given, with no spaces, newlines, or any extra characters.

**Do not output anything besides the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s.**
