Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning that **any correct, faithful implementation** of the snippet will **always**, under **every valid input** scenario, produce the **correct, deterministic output** that passes **all possible unit tests** for its problem domain without exceptions or failures.

For each snippet, answer **1 (reproducible)** if and only if **all** of the following conditions hold **unconditionally**:

1. **Explicit completeness:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial conditions are **fully and precisely specified** with no ambiguity, omissions, or implicit assumptions.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous logic:** Every operation, control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion), computation, and function call is described so precisely and deterministically that no implementation variation or external state can alter behavior or result; no randomness, side effects, or environment dependencies exist.

3. **Total correctness on all valid inputs:** The snippet guarantees well-defined, valid outputs for **every possible valid input**, including all edge cases (empty, boundary, exceptional, null inputs), without partial, undefined, or error responses.

4. **Self-contained and independent:** The snippet does not rely on any external factors, assumptions, or unstated context; it can be implemented exactly as specified with no external references or hidden dependencies.

5. **Consistent reproducibility:** Repeated executions on the same input always produce the identical correct output, ensuring the snippet inherently passes all corresponding unit tests in all implementations.

If **any** of these conditions fail, answer **0** for that snippet.

**Output format:**  
- Output exactly one digit per snippet in the input order:  
 `1` = reproducible;  
 `0` = not reproducible.  
- Concatenate all results **directly** with no spaces, line breaks, or extra characters.  
- Output **only** the concatenated digits, nothing else—no explanations, no whitespace, no formatting.
