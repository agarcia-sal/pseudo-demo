Analyze each provided pseudocode snippet independently and determine if it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as given to reliably produce correct, deterministic outputs passing all unit tests for every valid input—by exhaustively verifying these essential aspects:

1. **Complete specification:** The snippet explicitly and unambiguously defines all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial conditions. No assumptions are required beyond what is stated or can be rigorously inferred. Valid input ranges or domains are clearly included or logically deducible.

2. **Deterministic and precise operations:** Every step—calculations, data manipulation, control flow (branches, loops, recursion)—is explicitly defined without ambiguity, nondeterminism, randomness, or reliance on implicit external or mutable state. Side effects are either absent or fully accounted for within the snippet.

3. **Exhaustive and robust input handling:** All valid inputs, including edge cases and exceptional conditions, are properly handled to prevent errors, undefined behavior, or inconsistent results under any valid input scenario.

4. **Self-contained without external dependencies:** The snippet is fully standalone, requiring no outside code, libraries, environment variables, or global state beyond what is contained in or explicitly stated by the pseudocode.

5. **Consistent, repeatable output:** For identical inputs, outputs must be stable and reproducible with no variation between runs.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet meets *all* the above criteria entirely and without exception, guaranteeing deterministic correctness and full unit test passability.  
  - `0` otherwise, if any ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge-case coverage, implicit dependencies, or other deficiencies exist.  
- If multiple snippets are provided, output their evaluations as a single string of concatenated digits in their input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanation, or extraneous characters.

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input pseudocodes, and nothing else.**
