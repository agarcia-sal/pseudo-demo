Evaluate the following pseudocode(s) carefully to determine if each one is fully reproducible—that is, can be unambiguously and exhaustively implemented exactly as given so that it deterministically produces correct outputs for *all* valid inputs and passes *every* conceivable unit test.  

For each pseudocode snippet, assess all these critical aspects:  

- Complete, explicit definitions and initializations for all inputs, variables, constants, and data structures.  
- Fully specified, unambiguous, and deterministic operations, conditions, loops, and control flow, with no reliance on implicit assumptions or external context.  
- Thorough handling of all possible input domains and edge cases, with no logical gaps or omissions.  
- Sufficient detail enabling a developer to implement the logic *exactly* as shown, without requiring interpretation, guesswork, or filling in missing parts.  
- Correctness and consistency that ensure the output will always be reproducible and verifiable by exhaustive unit testing.  

Your output must be a sequence of digits, one per pseudocode snippet processed, concatenated with no spaces or extra characters:  

- Output **1** if the pseudocode snippet meets *all* these strict reproducibility criteria.  
- Output **0** if there is *any* ambiguity, missing detail, logical flaw, or incompleteness that prevents guaranteed reproducibility.  

The order of digits must correspond exactly to the order in which pseudocode snippets are provided. Output nothing else—no explanations, no line breaks, no formatting.
