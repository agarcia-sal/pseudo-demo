Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand, using more natural language. Write the pseudocode without providing any purpose, summary, overview, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Use one-liners, symbolic notation, and abbreviations where possible to keep it compact and reduce line count. Prefer a format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid comments or explanations. Aim for clarity and brevity, even if some details are omitted. Use numbering for each line of pseudocode. Your function has a 5-second timeout; prioritize generating the best output within this limit.
