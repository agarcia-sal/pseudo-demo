Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, your task is to **deterministically and rigorously assess whether each snippet is fully reproducible**—meaning it can be implemented exactly as provided to produce correct, consistent outputs that pass all unit tests for every valid input without exception.

To decide this, verify that each snippet meets **all** of the following stringent criteria:

1. **Complete Specification:** Every element—inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial conditions—is explicitly and unambiguously defined within the snippet. No information or assumptions required beyond the snippet itself. Valid input domains and preconditions are clearly stated or inherently deducible.

2. **Deterministic and Unambiguous Logic:** All operations including control flow constructs (conditionals, loops, recursion), calculations, and data manipulations are precisely and fully described without ambiguity. There is no nondeterministic behavior such as randomness, concurrency issues, or dependencies on external or mutable global states.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage:** The snippet explicitly accounts for **all** valid inputs, including edge cases, boundary values, and exceptional conditions, ensuring no runtime errors, undefined behavior, or logical omissions occur on any valid input.

4. **Self-Containment:** The snippet requires no external dependencies—such as libraries, environment variables, or global state—and does not rely on any context beyond what is provided.

5. **Repeatable, Consistent Output:** For the same input, the snippet guarantees identical outputs every time, ensuring reproducible results that will pass unit tests consistently without variability.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet **fully satisfies all the five criteria above** with no exceptions, thereby guaranteeing deterministic and correct behavior under all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if it **fails any** of these criteria due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing cases, implicit external dependencies, or other factors causing uncertainty or errors.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their results concatenated in input order as a single string of `1`s and `0`s with **no spaces, newlines, explanations, or additional characters**.

**Respond ONLY with this concatenated string corresponding to the input snippets, and NOTHING else.**
