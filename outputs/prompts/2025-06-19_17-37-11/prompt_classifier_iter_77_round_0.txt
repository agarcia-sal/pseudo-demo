Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, **for each snippet determine with absolute certainty whether it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as-is to produce correct, deterministic outputs that pass all unit tests on every valid input without exception.**

To decide, rigorously and systematically verify **all** of the following critical criteria:

1. **Complete explicitness:** The pseudocode fully specifies every element necessary for implementation, including all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial states. There are no ambiguities, unstated assumptions, or missing definitions. The valid input domain and any preconditions are either explicitly stated or fully inferrable from the snippet itself.

2. **Precise, deterministic logic:** Every operation, control structure (branches, loops, recursion), and data manipulation is unambiguous, fully defined, and deterministic. The snippet contains no randomness, nondeterministic choices, hidden side effects, or reliance on external/global/mutable state or environment conditions. All functions, calculations, and state transitions have explicitly specified behavior.

3. **Complete input coverage:** The logic guarantees correct handling of every possible valid input, including edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios. No valid input can cause undefined behavior, runtime errors, infinite loops, or inconsistent results.

4. **Self-contained and context-independent:** The snippet can be faithfully implemented and executed solely based on the information within it, without any external dependencies such as libraries, external data, environment variables, or global states.

5. **Deterministic, repeatable output:** For any specific input, the pseudocode always produces exactly the same output consistently—ensuring full reproducibility and guaranteed passage of unit tests.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if all the above criteria are fully satisfied with zero ambiguity or exception.  
  - `0` if the snippet fails any criterion for any reason, including ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, implicit dependencies, or any uncertainty that prevents guaranteed unit test success.

- When multiple snippets are provided, output the results as a single concatenated string in the original input order, without any spaces, newlines, explanations, or other characters.

**Respond ONLY with this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s, nothing else.**
