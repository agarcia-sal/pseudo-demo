Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed within the markdown block below, your task is to determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—meaning it can be implemented exactly as provided to produce correct, deterministic outputs that will pass all unit tests for every valid input without any failure.

To do this, rigorously verify that each snippet satisfies all of the following essential, non-negotiable criteria:

1. **Explicit completeness:** The snippet defines all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial conditions explicitly and unambiguously, with no missing details or hidden assumptions. If input domains or preconditions are not stated, the snippet itself must implicitly restrict or characterize them clearly.

2. **Unambiguous and deterministic logic:** All operations, control flows (conditionals, loops, recursion), and data manipulations are fully specified with zero ambiguity or underspecification. The snippet exhibits no nondeterministic elements such as randomness, concurrency, external or mutable state dependencies, implicit side effects, or platform/environment-specific behavior.

3. **Comprehensive input coverage and error handling:** Every valid input case—including all edge conditions, boundaries, and exceptional inputs—is explicitly handled or logically accounted for without causing runtime errors, undefined behavior, or divergence.

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:** The snippet can be reimplemented exactly as-is without relying on external libraries, global variables, hidden state, environment-dependent behavior, or any contextual information beyond what is provided within the snippet itself.

5. **Consistent repeatability:** Given the same input, the snippet always produces the same output without variation, ensuring fully deterministic behavior and reproducibility.

**Instructions for output:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if **all** the above criteria are strictly met, guaranteeing the snippet will deterministically pass every unit test for all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if any criterion is violated, including ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, reliance on implicit or external context, or unreproducible output.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their corresponding results concatenated as a single string in the order provided, without any spaces, line breaks, explanations, or extra characters.  

**Your entire response must be this exact string of `1`s and `0`s and nothing else.**
