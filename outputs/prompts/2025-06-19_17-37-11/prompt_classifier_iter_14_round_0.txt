Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, perform a thorough, formal evaluation of each snippet’s **full reproducibility**—defined as the guarantee that any exact, faithful implementation of the snippet will pass **every valid unit test** on **all possible valid inputs** without failure or ambiguity.

For each snippet, confirm **all** of the following conditions are met **simultaneously**:

1. **Exhaustive explicitness:**  
 - Inputs, outputs, variables, constants, and data structures are completely and precisely specified with exact types, formats, and constraints.  
 - Initialization steps, preconditions, and any necessary environment setup are fully detailed, with no hidden, assumed, or external dependencies.

2. **Unambiguous and deterministic logic:**  
 - Each operation—arithmetic, logical, control flow (including loops and recursion), and function calls—is described clearly and fully, permitting only one precise interpretation.  
 - No use of randomness, side effects, or reliance on external or mutable global state that could cause nondeterministic outcomes.

3. **Complete input domain coverage:**  
 - Correct handling is explicitly guaranteed or logically entailed for every valid input, including all edge cases such as empty, null, minimal, maximal, or exceptional inputs, without producing undefined, erroneous, or partial results.

4. **Self-contained correctness:**  
 - The snippet contains all necessary information internally to ensure correctness and reproducibility, without requiring any external references, implicit knowledge, environment specifics, or implementation-dependent behavior.

5. **Implementation feasibility and consistency:**  
 - A competent programmer can implement the snippet exactly as given, producing consistent, correct results on every run for identical inputs, with no ambiguity or room for divergent behavior.

---

**Output instructions:**  
- For each provided pseudocode snippet, output **only a single digit**:  
 - **1** if and only if the snippet fully satisfies all the above criteria guaranteeing reproducibility.  
 - **0** if it fails to satisfy any one or more criteria—e.g., due to ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumptions, nondeterminism, or incomplete input coverage.  
- If multiple snippets are provided, output their corresponding digits **in snippet order**, concatenated with no spaces, line breaks, or any other characters.

**Strictly output nothing else besides the requested concatenated digits.**
