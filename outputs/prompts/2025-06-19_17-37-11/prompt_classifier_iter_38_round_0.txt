Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **fully reproducible**, defined as follows:

A pseudocode snippet is **fully reproducible** if and only if *any correct and faithful implementation* of it will, on **every possible valid input within the problem domain**, deterministically and consistently produce the correct output passing **all unit tests without exception**.

For each snippet, assess and confirm **all** of these criteria hold **absolutely and unconditionally**:

1. **Comprehensive and explicit specification:**  
 - All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, preconditions, and initial states are explicitly and completely defined.  
 - No assumptions, implicit context, or missing details exist—everything needed for faithful implementation is provided clearly within the snippet.

2. **Unambiguous and deterministic logic:**  
 - Every operation—control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion), data manipulation, arithmetic, and function invocation—is precisely described without vagueness or potential for multiple valid interpretations.  
 - No nondeterminism, randomness, concurrency issues, or hidden external dependencies affect the behavior.

3. **Exhaustive correctness for all valid inputs:**  
 - The snippet guarantees correct, well-defined, and complete behavior for **every valid input**, including all edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, exceptional cases).  
 - There are no inputs for which the behavior is partial, undefined, or incorrect.

4. **Self-contained and implementable as-is:**  
 - The snippet requires no external information, environment setup, or assumptions beyond what is explicitly provided.  
 - It can be implemented exactly from the snippet without referencing external definitions, undocumented states, or unstated protocols.

5. **Consistent reproducibility and test pass guarantee:**  
 - Any faithful implementation following this snippet outputs the same correct result for the same input every time.  
 - The snippet inherently ensures passing all valid unit tests under any faithful implementation without fail.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
 - `1` if **all** the conditions above are unambiguously met, guaranteeing reproducibility and test pass.  
 - `0` if **any** condition is not fully satisfied, including ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing cases, implicit assumptions, or uncertainty.  
- If multiple snippets are given, output the digits concatenated **exactly in input order, with no spaces, line breaks, or additional characters**.  

**No explanations, comments, or formatting beyond the required concatenated digits are allowed.**
