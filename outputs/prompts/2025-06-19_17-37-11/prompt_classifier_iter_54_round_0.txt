Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, determine for each snippet **whether it is fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests for every valid input without fail**, by strictly evaluating all of the following aspects:

1. **Explicit completeness:** The snippet fully and precisely defines all inputs, outputs, data structures, variables, constants, initialization steps, and preconditions. There are no gaps, unstated assumptions, or ambiguities that require external interpretation.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic logic:** Every step—including computations, control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion), and data manipulation—is clearly and exactly specified. The snippet contains no randomness, external or mutable dependencies, unspecified behaviors, or side effects.

3. **Exhaustive correctness over the entire valid input space:** The pseudocode explicitly and correctly handles every valid input, including edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional inputs, producing well-defined, correct results in every scenario.

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:** The snippet is implementable exactly as given without relying on any external libraries, global states, hidden context, or assumptions beyond the snippet itself.

5. **Fully deterministic output:** Any faithful implementation based strictly on the snippet produces the same output for identical inputs on every run, ensuring reproducibility and consistent unit test success.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet satisfies **all** these criteria without exception, guaranteeing reproducible, correct, deterministic results that pass all unit tests.  
  - `0` if it fails **any one or more** criteria due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, implicit dependencies, or any uncertainty.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their results concatenated in order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other characters.

**Respond only with the string of `1`s and `0`s in corresponding order. No additional output or commentary.**
