Evaluate each provided pseudocode snippet to determine if it is **fully reproducible**—meaning an exact implementation of that snippet will **pass every valid unit test for all possible inputs in its defined problem domain without exception**.

For each snippet, confirm that **all** of the following conditions are strictly met:

1. **Explicit complete specifications:**  
 - All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and their types or formats are fully and precisely defined, leaving no ambiguity.  
 - Initial states, preconditions, and any required setup are clearly stated and require no external assumptions.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous logic:**  
 - Every step (arithmetic, logical, control structures, recursion, function calls) is specified in detail, eliminating alternative interpretations.  
 - No randomness, implicit environment dependencies, side effects, or nondeterministic elements are present.

3. **Exhaustive input coverage and error handling:**  
 - The snippet ensures correct, well-defined behavior for all valid inputs, including typical cases, boundary conditions, empty or null inputs, and other edge cases.  
 - Errors and exceptional cases are explicitly addressed or safely handled without undefined or unstable outcomes.

4. **Self-contained and context-independent:**  
 - All necessary information to implement and verify correctness is present within the snippet itself; it does not depend on external knowledge, runtime environments, or unstated conventions.

5. **Implementation-ready clarity:**  
 - Any competent programmer can produce an exact, consistent implementation solely from the snippet that reproduces the intended behavior on all runs with the same inputs.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet supplied, output exactly one digit:  
 - **1** if it satisfies all the above criteria, guaranteeing reproducibility.  
 - **0** if it fails any criterion (e.g., ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumptions, nondeterminism, partial input coverage).  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their digits **concatenated in the input order**, with no spaces, line breaks, or extraneous characters.

**Do not provide any explanations, reasoning, or additional formatting. Output only the concatenated digits.**
