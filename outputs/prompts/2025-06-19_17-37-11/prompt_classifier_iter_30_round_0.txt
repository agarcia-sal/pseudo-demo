Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, evaluate each snippet independently and determine if it is **fully reproducible** under the following rigorous criteria: every correct, faithful implementation derived solely from the snippet will deterministically pass **all** valid unit tests for **every possible input** in its problem domain, without exception.

For each pseudocode snippet, confirm **strictly and unconditionally** ALL of these:

1. **Complete explicit specification:** Every detail required to implement the algorithm is present and unambiguous—this includes definitions of all inputs, outputs, internal variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and any preconditions. There are no missing details, no implicit assumptions, and no reliance on unstated external factors.

2. **Deterministic, unambiguous instructions:** Each computational step, control flow construct (including loops, recursion, conditionals), and function call is precisely described without any ambiguity, randomness, or side effects from external or hidden mutable states. All operations are fully defined and reproducible.

3. **Total correctness over the entire input domain:** The snippet guarantees correct and well-defined output for every possible valid input, including all edge cases (such as empty inputs, boundary values, null or special cases), with no partial, undefined, or erroneous behavior. This includes handling exceptional or abnormal inputs as specified or reasonably inferred by the snippet itself.

4. **Fully self-contained and implementable as-is:** The snippet requires no additional external context, assumptions, or auxiliary information beyond what is explicitly provided. It is ready for direct implementation without referencing any hidden state, external environment, or implicit knowledge.

5. **Consistent and reproducible outputs:** Any faithful implementation of the snippet will produce bit-for-bit identical and correct outputs on identical inputs, ensuring that all unit tests relevant to the snippet’s problem domain will always be passed reliably and deterministically.

**Output format:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
 - `1` if and only if **all** the above conditions are strictly satisfied, thus guaranteeing reproducibility.  
 - `0` if **any** single condition is violated, indicating the snippet is not guaranteed reproducible.  
- If multiple snippets are given, output their corresponding digits concatenated **directly with no separators, spaces, line breaks, or extra characters**.

**Strict constraints:**  
- Output only the concatenated digits as specified—no explanations, formatting, whitespace, comments, or any additional characters are allowed.  
- The order of output digits must exactly match the order in which the pseudocode snippets are presented.
