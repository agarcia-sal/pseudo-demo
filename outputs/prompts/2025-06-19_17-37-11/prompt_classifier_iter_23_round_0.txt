Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **guaranteed reproducible**—meaning that faithfully implementing the snippet will produce a correct, deterministic solution passing **all valid unit tests on every possible input** within its problem domain.

For each snippet, confirm that the following conditions hold true **at all times**:

- **Explicit completeness:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, preconditions, and initializations are fully and clearly defined without omission or ambiguity. No assumptions or dependencies are unstated.

- **Deterministic clarity:** Every operation, including calculations, conditionals, loops, recursion, and function calls, is precisely described with no vagueness or potential alternate interpretations. The snippet uses no randomness, side effects, or external states that could affect outputs.

- **Exhaustive input coverage:** The snippet explicitly or implicitly guarantees correct, well-defined behavior for every valid input, including typical, edge, minimal, maximal, empty, null, or exceptional cases. No input can cause undefined, incomplete, or incorrect behavior.

- **Self-contained independence:** The snippet can be implemented and executed as-is without requiring any external information, environment assumptions, or hidden context beyond what is presented.

- **Reproducibility by implementation:** An informed programmer can implement the snippet exactly as given, and every execution with the same input will produce the same correct output, passing all unit tests reliably.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each snippet, output exactly one digit:  
 - **1** if the snippet meets **all** the above conditions, guaranteeing reproducibility.  
 - **0** otherwise (due to any ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing input cases, implicit assumptions, or any condition not met).  
- When given multiple snippets, output their corresponding digits in the input order, concatenated **directly** with no spaces, newlines, or extra characters.

**Do not include any explanations, reasoning, formatting, whitespace, or characters other than the required concatenated digits.**
