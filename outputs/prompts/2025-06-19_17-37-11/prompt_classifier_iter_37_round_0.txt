Evaluate each given pseudocode snippet independently and determine if it is **unconditionally reproducible**, meaning that any correct implementation adhering faithfully to the snippet will always pass every possible valid unit test for its problem domain. Output `1` if and only if **all** the following precise criteria are met; otherwise output `0`:

1. **Comprehensive clarity:** The snippet fully specifies all necessary elements—inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and preconditions—with zero ambiguity, omissions, or hidden assumptions. The snippet leaves no details to interpretation or inference.

2. **Full deterministic definition:** Every operation, control flow structure (including loops, recursion, and conditionals), calculation, and call is described explicitly and deterministically. There must be no randomness, probabilistic behavior, external state dependency, side effects, or undefined behavior.

3. **Complete domain coverage:** The snippet guarantees correct, well-defined behavior for *every* valid input, including typical, boundary, null, exceptional, or edge cases. No input scenario can cause partial correctness, indeterminacy, crash, or undefined output.

4. **Self-contained implementability:** The snippet needs no additional information, external resources, environment assumptions, or hidden contextual knowledge beyond what is clearly presented. Implementation is straightforwardly possible without guesswork or supplementation.

5. **Consistent correctness:** Any faithful implementation yields the same correct output on the same input, reliably and reproducibly passing all valid unit tests without fail.

**Output Instructions:**  
For each pseudocode snippet in input order, output exactly one digit:  
- `1` if it meets all the above conditions without exception;  
- `0` otherwise.  
Output the digits concatenated directly, with no spaces, line breaks, comments, or any other characters. No explanations or formatting—only the digit string.
