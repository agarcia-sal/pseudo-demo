Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, determine for each snippet whether it is **completely reproducible**. Reproducible means that **every correct and faithful implementation of the snippet always produces fully correct, deterministic, and consistent outputs that pass all valid unit tests for every possible input, without exception or failure.**

To decide reproducibility, rigorously verify that **all** of the following are met **for each snippet, unconditionally**:

1. **Complete and precise specification:** The snippet explicitly defines *all* inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, initialization states, assumptions, and preconditions. No element is left undefined, implicit, ambiguous, or relying on unstated context.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic logic:** Every computational step, control flow (loops, branches, recursion), and call to any subroutine is described with absolute clarity and determinism. No inherent randomness, concurrency issues, side effects from external state, or external dependencies are present or implied.

3. **Total correctness over entire domain:** The snippet guarantees correct, fully defined behavior —including all edge, boundary, exceptional, invalid, or corner cases— with no partial, undefined, or erroneous outcomes for any valid input within the problem domain.

4. **Self-contained implementation:** The snippet can be implemented exactly as given, requiring *no* additional code, definitions, assumptions, external libraries, or environment beyond what is fully described.

5. **Deterministic and stable output under identical inputs:** Every correct implementation adhering strictly to the snippet will produce identical outputs on repeated runs for the same inputs, always passing every unit test designed for the problem.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one digit:  
 - `1` if *all* above conditions hold, guaranteeing reproducible correctness.  
 - `0` if *any* condition fails due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, reliance on unstated assumptions, missing coverage of input cases, or any uncertainty.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their corresponding digits concatenated *immediately* in input order, with no spaces, newlines, or extra characters.

**Do not output anything else—no explanations, no formatting, no whitespace or additional text whatsoever.**
