Evaluate each given pseudocode snippet to determine if it is absolutely **reproducible**—meaning any direct implementation exactly as written will pass **every possible** valid unit test for its entire input domain without fail.

For each snippet, perform a thorough assessment to confirm that **all** the following strict conditions hold simultaneously:

1. **Explicit completeness:**  
 - All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, and data structures are precisely and exhaustively defined with clear, implementable specifications.  
 - Initialization steps, preconditions, and environment assumptions are fully stated and require no additional inference or external context.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous specification:**  
 - Every operation, including arithmetic, logic, data manipulation, control constructs (if, loops, recursion), and function calls, is described in a way that admits exactly one clear interpretation.  
 - No element of randomness, concurrency, side effects, or dependencies on external or mutable states that are not described.

3. **Guaranteed correctness over entire input space:**  
 - The snippet explicitly or logically ensures correct behavior for all valid inputs, including typical, boundary (empty, minimal, maximal), and exceptional cases—without undefined, erroneous, or partial behaviors.

4. **Context independence and self-containment:**  
 - The snippet requires no unstated assumptions, external libraries, environment configurations, or implementation-specific behaviors beyond what is clearly provided.

5. **Implementation readiness:**  
 - Any skilled programmer can implement the snippet verbatim, resulting in fully reproducible outputs on any repeated execution with identical inputs.

**Output instructions:**  
- For the provided pseudocode snippets, output a string of digits without spaces or other characters:  
 - Output **1** for each snippet that meets **all** the above criteria.  
 - Output **0** for each snippet failing any criterion.  
- Maintain the order of output digits matching the input snippet order.  
- Output **only** this string of digits with no explanations, formatting, or additional text.
