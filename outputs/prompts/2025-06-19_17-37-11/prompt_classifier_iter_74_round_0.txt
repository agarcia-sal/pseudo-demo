Given one or more pseudocode snippets provided below, **for each snippet, determine whether it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as presented to produce completely correct, consistent, and deterministic outputs passing all unit tests for every valid input without exception.**

To do so, rigorously verify that each snippet satisfies **all** of the following essential criteria:

1. **Explicit and comprehensive specification:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and assumptions are clearly and unambiguously defined. No information is implicit or missing; valid input domains and preconditions are either explicitly stated or clearly inferable solely from the pseudocode.

2. **Deterministic and precise execution:** Every operation and control structure (conditionals, loops, recursion, function calls, state changes) is explicitly described with no ambiguity, randomness, or reliance on external mutable states, implicit context, or hidden side effects. The pseudocode’s behavior is fully determined solely by its stated logic and inputs.

3. **Complete and robust input handling:** The logic exhaustively addresses all valid inputs, edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios within the declared input domain, guaranteeing no runtime errors, undefined behavior, or logical gaps.

4. **Self-sufficiency and environment independence:** The snippet requires no external dependencies, libraries, frameworks, global variables, environment-specific features, or unstated assumptions beyond the pseudocode itself.

5. **Deterministic reproducibility and output consistency:** For identical valid inputs, the snippet produces the exact same outputs every execution, guaranteeing deterministic, repeatable results that ensure passing all unit tests reliably.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one digit:  
  - `1` if and only if **all five criteria are fulfilled completely and unequivocally**, guaranteeing the snippet’s reproducibility and unit-test success for every valid input.  
  - `0` if **any criterion is violated**, including but not limited to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge-case coverage, implicit dependencies, or vulnerabilities to runtime/logic errors.  
- When evaluating multiple snippets, output their results as a single concatenated string in the order the snippets are provided.  
- **Output nothing else. No explanations, whitespace, or extra characters.**
