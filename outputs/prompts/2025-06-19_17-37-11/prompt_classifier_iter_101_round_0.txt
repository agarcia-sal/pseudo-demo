Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—that is, can be implemented precisely as provided to unambiguously and deterministically pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input without any external assumptions or modifications. To decide, rigorously verify that **all** of the following rigorous conditions hold true **simultaneously**:

1. **Complete and Explicit Definition:** Every element—inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial states—is thoroughly specified within the snippet. There is zero ambiguity or missing information, and any assumptions or input constraints are either explicitly stated or clearly and logically derivable from the pseudocode itself.

2. **Precisely Defined Deterministic Logic:** All operations, control flows including all branches, loops, and recursion, data manipulations, and calculations are unambiguously specified with exact semantics. There is no use of randomness, external state, hidden side effects, implicit behaviors, or any source of nondeterminism.

3. **Exhaustive Valid Input Coverage:** The pseudocode guarantees correct handling of the entire valid input domain, explicitly or implicitly covering all normal cases, boundary conditions, edge cases, and exceptional inputs without causing errors, infinite loops, or undefined states.

4. **Isolation and Self-Sufficiency:** The snippet is completely standalone, requiring no external libraries, resources, global or environment-dependent variables, or unstated context. It can be implemented perfectly based solely on the information provided.

5. **Consistent, Repeatable Output:** Given identical inputs, the snippet deterministically produces exactly the same output every time, ensuring reproducible results corresponding to guaranteed unit test success.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet in the given order, output exactly one character:  
  - Output `1` if and only if the snippet meets *all five* conditions perfectly and completely, certifying reproducibility and guaranteed passing of all unit tests on all valid inputs.  
  - Otherwise, output `0` if it fails any single condition due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing cases, external dependencies, or any uncertainty or undefined behavior.  
- Concatenate outputs for multiple snippets directly in the input order, as a single continuous string with no spaces, newlines, or extra characters.

**No explanations, comments, clarifications, or any output beyond the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s—strictly only the results.**
