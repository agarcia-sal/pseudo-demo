Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning that any correct implementation following the pseudocode will produce a deterministically correct solution that passes **all possible valid unit tests for every input in the defined problem domain** without fail.

For each snippet, verify **all** the following rigorous criteria hold **universally**:

1. **Complete definition:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, precondition, initialization, and auxiliary element needed is explicitly and unambiguously specified. There are no implicit assumptions, missing definitions, or external dependencies outside the snippet.

2. **Precise determinism:** All algorithmic steps — including control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion), calculations, data manipulations, and function calls — are fully and exactly described such that the behavior is invariant, deterministic, and free from randomness, concurrency issues, side effects, or external environmental influence.

3. **Exhaustive correctness:** The snippet logically covers all valid input scenarios, including edge, boundary, corner, empty, null, and exceptional cases, ensuring well-defined, complete, and correct outputs for each. No input triggers incomplete, undefined, ambiguous, or incorrect execution paths.

4. **Self-contained completeness:** The snippet contains everything necessary to implement the solution as-is, without reliance on external code, background, hidden context, or assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated.

5. **Implementation fidelity:** An experienced programmer can implement the snippet verbatim to produce a solution that, on identical inputs, consistently yields the exact correct outputs that pass all valid unit tests every time.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output a single digit:  
 - Output **1** if it satisfies **all** the above criteria, guaranteeing reproducibility.  
 - Output **0** otherwise (due to any ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing or implicit input handling, external dependencies, or failure to meet any above condition).  
- When multiple snippets are input, output their respective digits concatenated in the exact input order, with no spaces, line breaks, or additional characters—only the concatenated string of digits.

**Strictly output only this concatenated string of digits with no explanations, formatting, or extraneous text.**
