Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, rigorously evaluate each snippet to determine if it is **fully reproducible**, meaning it is guaranteed to pass all unit tests for every valid input without fail. Your judgment must be based solely on the information contained within the snippet and your precise logical analysis. For each snippet, assess the following critical criteria:

1. **Complete explicitness:** The pseudocode must unambiguously specify all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initializations, and any assumptions or preconditions. No information essential for correct implementation or verification can be implicit, missing, or vague.

2. **Deterministic, unambiguous logic:** Every operation, control flow construct (like loops, conditionals, recursion), and data manipulation must be explicitly and precisely defined. The snippet must not depend on randomness, hidden state, external or mutable context, or unspecified behavior.

3. **Exhaustive correctness:** The snippet must explicitly ensure correct and defined behavior for every possible valid input, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional inputs. It must either contain explicit handling or logically guarantee correctness across the entire valid input domain.

4. **Self-contained and implementation-agnostic:** The snippet must be implementable exactly as given, without requiring external libraries, frameworks, prior definitions, environment-dependent features, or global states beyond what is provided in the snippet.

5. **Consistent deterministic output:** For every valid input, any faithful implementation based solely on this pseudocode should produce identical outputs on every execution, guaranteeing reproducibility and consistent unit test success.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if, and only if, it meets **all five criteria fully and without exception**, meaning it is guaranteed reproducible and passes all unit tests.  
  - `0` if it fails in any aspect—due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing or implicit edge case handling, external dependencies, or any uncertainty.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their results concatenated in the exact order they appear, with **no spaces, newlines, explanations, or additional characters**.

**Respond only with the raw string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to each snippet's assessment. No other text or formatting.**
