Evaluate each given pseudocode snippet independently and determine if it is **fully reproducible**, meaning any correct implementation based solely on the snippet will always pass all valid unit tests for every possible input without exception.

For each snippet, output `1` only if **all** of the following criteria are met **unconditionally**; otherwise, output `0`:

1. **Explicit completeness:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and their initializations are explicitly and unambiguously defined; there are no missing elements, implicit assumptions, or vague descriptions.

2. **Deterministic, unambiguous steps:** Every operation—including control flow, computation, recursion, and function invocations—is specified clearly and precisely, without any randomness, external dependencies, or hidden state influencing execution.

3. **Correctness and totality:** The snippet guarantees correct behavior for **every valid input**, including all edge cases, without exceptions, partial definitions, or undefined outputs.

4. **Self-contained implementability:** The snippet requires no external context, unspecified functions, or environmental conditions beyond what is presented; it can be implemented exactly as given.

5. **Consistent, test-passing outputs:** Any faithful implementation will consistently produce the same correct result for identical inputs and pass all unit tests defined by the problem domain.

---

**Output format:**  
- For each snippet in input order, output exactly one character:  
 - `1` if it meets all criteria above and reproducibility is guaranteed.  
 - `0` otherwise.  
- Concatenate these digits with no spaces, line breaks, or additional characters.

**Output nothing else—no explanations, formatting, or extra text.**
