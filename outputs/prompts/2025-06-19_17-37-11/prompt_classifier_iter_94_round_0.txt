Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is fully **reproducible**—meaning it can be unambiguously implemented directly as-is to pass *all* unit tests flawlessly on *every* valid input, with no need for assumptions or external information.

To decide, rigorously verify that the snippet meets **all** of these strict criteria:

1. **Explicit and Complete Specification:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, function, constant, and initial value is fully and clearly defined without ambiguity or omissions. Any input constraints or necessary assumptions are explicitly stated or logically deducible solely from the snippet.

2. **Precise, Deterministic Logic:** The logic and operations—including control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion), calculations, and data manipulations—are exhaustively specified with exact clarity and no vagueness, randomness, external state, side effects, or undefined behavior.

3. **Comprehensive Valid Input Coverage:** All possible valid inputs—including edge cases, boundary conditions, and error conditions—are accounted for, guaranteeing no runtime failures, infinite loops, or undefined results under any permissible input.

4. **Context-Free and Fully Self-Contained:** The snippet relies solely on the information provided; it uses no external libraries, global variables, hidden context, or resources beyond what is explicitly included. It can be implemented without supplementary details or dependencies.

5. **Consistent, Reproducible Output:** For the same inputs, the snippet always produces the exact same output deterministically, ensuring test results are stable and repeatable.

---

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each input pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if the snippet meets **all five criteria perfectly**, guaranteeing full reproducibility and universal unit test success.  
  - `0` otherwise—if it violates any criterion, including ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, omitted edge cases, external dependencies, or any uncertainty/error sources.  
- If multiple snippets are provided, output their results concatenated in the same order, with no spaces, newlines, or any extra characters.

**Strictly output only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s. No explanations, comments, or additional text.**
