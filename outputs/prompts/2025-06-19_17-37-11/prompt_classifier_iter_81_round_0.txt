Given one or more pseudocode snippets provided below, **for each snippet independently determine whether it is fully reproducible**—meaning it can be precisely implemented as-is to always produce correct, consistent outputs that pass *all* possible unit tests for every valid input—by rigorously assessing the following essential dimensions:

1. **Explicit completeness:** All necessary components are clearly and unambiguously defined, including inputs (with valid domains), outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial states. There are no omitted or implied assumptions, external dependencies, or undefined elements.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous logic:** Each step—calculations, data manipulations, control flow (branches, loops, recursion)—is described with exact clarity and without any nondeterminism, randomness, external state reliance, concurrency ambiguity, or vague/undefined operations.

3. **Robust edge case and error handling:** The pseudocode explicitly addresses every possible input condition within the valid domain, including boundary conditions, corner cases, and exceptional scenarios, ensuring no undefined behavior or missed cases that might cause failure.

4. **Self-sufficiency and purity:** The snippet can be implemented directly without requiring any external libraries, global/environmental variables, or hidden context outside what is given in the pseudocode itself.

5. **Deterministic repeatability:** For identical inputs, the snippet guarantees the exact same outputs every time under all circumstances, ensuring reproducibility and that all unit tests will consistently pass.

**Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character, concatenated in order with no separators, spaces, or extra characters:  
  - `1` if and only if all the above criteria are met perfectly, guaranteeing deterministic, complete, and correct implementation producing fully reproducible results passing all unit tests.  
  - `0` if any criterion is not fully satisfied, including ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge cases, implicit dependencies, or any source of implementation uncertainty or failure.  

- Output only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input snippets in the order they are provided, with no explanations or additional text.
