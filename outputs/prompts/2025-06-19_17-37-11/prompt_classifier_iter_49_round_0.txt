Given one or more pseudocode snippets delimited below, evaluate each snippet’s **full reproducibility**, defined as the guarantee that **any faithful, direct implementation of that snippet will always produce correct, deterministic outputs that pass all valid unit tests on every possible valid input without exception or variance.**

For each snippet, confirm all these **strict** conditions hold **without exception**:

1. **Complete explicit specification:** Inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, preconditions, initialization, and all operational semantics are fully and precisely detailed with no gaps, implicit assumptions, or undefined elements.

2. **Deterministic, unambiguous semantics:** Every computational step—including control flow (loops, recursion, conditionals), arithmetic/logical operations, and procedure calls—is explicitly specified with no ambiguity, hidden nondeterminism, randomness, or reliance on external mutable or hidden state.

3. **Universal domain correctness:** The snippet defines correct, well-defined behavior for *all* valid inputs, explicitly handling edge cases, boundary conditions, error cases, and special/degenerate scenarios with no undefined or partial behavior.

4. **Self-contained, context-independent:** The snippet requires no external code, environment variables, side information, configuration, or hidden dependencies beyond what is fully contained in the snippet itself.

5. **Guaranteed reproducibility:** Any correct implementation that follows the snippet exactly will produce identical, consistent outputs on repeated runs with identical inputs and will pass all applicable unit tests completely.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each input pseudocode snippet, output exactly one digit:  
 - `1` if *all* above criteria are strictly satisfied, ensuring reproducibility without qualification or doubt.  
 - `0` otherwise (if any criterion is not met, including ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumptions, nondeterminism, unhandled cases, or external dependency).  
- For multiple snippets, output their corresponding digits concatenated without spaces, newlines, or any additional characters.

**Do not output anything other than this digit string. No explanations, no whitespace, no formatting. The order of output digits corresponds exactly to the order in which snippets are provided.**
