Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—that is, whether it can be implemented exactly as given to produce correct, deterministic results that will pass *all* unit tests over *every* valid input without any ambiguity, missing information, or assumptions.

To decide this, rigorously and holistically verify that each snippet meets **all** the following strict criteria:

1. **Explicit and Exhaustive Specification:** The pseudocode completely defines all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial states with zero ambiguity or omitted details. Any assumptions, input constraints, or environmental conditions are clearly stated or can be logically deduced solely from the snippet.

2. **Precise, Unambiguous Logic:** All operations, control flows (including branches, loops, and recursion), data manipulations, and calculations are described in clear, deterministic terms without vague phrasing, implicit steps, randomness, or external state dependencies.

3. **Complete and Robust Input Coverage:** The logic explicitly or implicitly accounts for every valid input case—including edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios—ensuring no undefined behavior, runtime errors, or infinite loops can occur on any lawful input value.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Free:** The snippet is fully implementable as-is without reliance on any external libraries, global variables, hidden state, unstated assumptions, or environmental factors beyond what is fully specified within the snippet itself.

5. **Deterministic, Repeatable Output:** Given the same inputs, the snippet always produces exactly the same outputs with no variation or nondeterminism, guaranteeing consistent unit test results.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet meets *all five criteria* flawlessly, ensuring complete reproducibility and guaranteed unit test success for all valid inputs.  
  - `0` otherwise (if it fails even one criterion for any reason including ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case coverage, or external dependencies).  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results concatenated in the exact order given, without spaces, newlines, or any other characters.

**Do not include explanations, reasoning, or any additional text beyond this combined string of `1`s and `0`s.**
