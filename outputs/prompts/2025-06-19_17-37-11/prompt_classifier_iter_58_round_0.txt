Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, **for each snippet, determine with absolute certainty whether it is fully reproducible—that is, whether implementing it exactly as provided will yield correct, consistent, and deterministic outputs that pass all unit tests for every possible valid input without exception**. To do this, rigorously assess the snippet against the following critical, non-negotiable criteria:

1. **Complete clarity and explicitness:** The pseudocode fully specifies inputs, outputs, data types, variables, initial conditions, data structures, constants, and any required setup. No key detail may be omitted or assumed implicitly. All input domains and preconditions are clearly defined or logically inferable within the snippet’s context.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic logic:** Every step, including control flows (conditionals, loops, recursion), computations, and data manipulations, must be described precisely and without vagueness. There must be no randomness, no hidden or implicit state dependencies, no side effects, no undefined or environment-dependent operations.

3. **Comprehensive input handling:** The logic explicitly accounts for all valid inputs, including edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional situations, ensuring no undefined behaviors, crashes, or errors occur for any allowed input.

4. **Self-sufficiency and environmental independence:** The snippet must be implementable exactly as given with no required external code, environment states, global variables, or dependencies beyond what is fully described within the pseudocode itself.

5. **Consistency and repeatability:** Given identical inputs, the snippet always produces exactly the same outputs, guaranteeing reproducible and stable unit test results without variance or flakiness.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character, **no spaces, no newlines, no explanations:**  
  - Output `1` only if the snippet meets **all five criteria strictly and entirely**, ensuring guaranteed reproducibility and passing of all unit tests on all valid inputs.  
  - Output `0` if the snippet fails any criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, implicit dependencies, missing edge cases, or any reason that compromises reproducibility or correctness.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their corresponding results concatenated in the exact order the snippets appear.

**Respond exclusively with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to each snippet’s reproducibility evaluation, and nothing else.**
