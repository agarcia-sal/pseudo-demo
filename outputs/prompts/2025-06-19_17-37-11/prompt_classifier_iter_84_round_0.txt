Given one or more pseudocode snippets delimited below, your task is to determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—meaning it can be implemented *exactly* as given to reliably produce correct, deterministic outputs that pass all unit tests for **every** valid input without fail. Your evaluation must rigorously check the snippet against all of the following essential, unambiguous criteria:

1. **Fully specified and precise:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data formats, constants, and any initial conditions are completely and explicitly defined. There must be no need for assumptions, external context, or guesswork to understand or implement the pseudocode.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous logic:** Every step, including data transformations, control flows (conditionals, loops, recursion), and calculations, is clearly and unambiguously described. The behavior must not depend on non-deterministic factors, hidden states, randomness, or any external or environment-dependent influences.

3. **Comprehensive input coverage:** The logic must handle the entire valid input domain, including normal cases, edge conditions, boundary values, and invalid or exceptional inputs where applicable. There can be no gaps that would lead to undefined behavior, runtime errors, or incorrect outputs.

4. **Self-contained and implementation-ready:** The snippet must be implementable exactly as written without requiring any external resources such as libraries, frameworks, external variables, or environment-specific setups. It must not rely on anything not presented within the pseudocode itself.

5. **Consistent, repeatable results:** For identical inputs, the snippet must always produce the exact same outputs, guaranteeing reproducible behavior and deterministic passing of unit tests.

**Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character as follows:  
  - `1` if and only if **all** the above criteria are fully and unconditionally met, ensuring the snippet is reproducible and will pass all unit tests reliably.  
  - `0` if the snippet fails **any** of these criteria due to any ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing or incomplete edge handling, implicit dependencies, or uncertainty.  
- If multiple snippets are provided, output a single concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to their respective evaluations in input order.  
- Your response must contain **only** this concatenated string of digits, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other characters.
