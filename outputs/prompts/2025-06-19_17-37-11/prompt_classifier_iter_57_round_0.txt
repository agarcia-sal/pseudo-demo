Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, **determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as given to produce correct, consistent outputs that pass all unit tests for every valid input without fail** by rigorously verifying all of the following comprehensive criteria:

1. **Complete and explicit specification:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial states are fully and unambiguously defined with no missing information or assumed context. Preconditions and valid input domains are clearly stated or implicit in the pseudocode itself.

2. **Deterministic, well-defined behavior:** Every operation, including all control flow (conditions, loops, recursion), data manipulations, and calculations, is precisely described without ambiguity. There is no nondeterministic behavior, randomness, reliance on external or mutable state, hidden side effects, or undefined operations.

3. **Exhaustive coverage of all valid inputs:** The logic explicitly handles every edge case, boundary condition, and exceptional scenario within the valid input domain, ensuring correctness and no runtime failures or undetermined outcomes for any valid input.

4. **Self-contained and environment-agnostic:** The snippet can be implemented exactly as-is without dependencies on external libraries, frameworks, global variables, environment states, or context beyond the pseudocode provided.

5. **Consistent, repeatable outputs:** For identical inputs, the pseudocode guarantees the exact same outputs every time, ensuring reproducibility and deterministic unit test success.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet meets **all above criteria fully and without exception**, guaranteeing it will deterministically and correctly pass all unit tests for every valid input.  
  - `0` if it fails **any** criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, implicit dependencies, or other sources of uncertainty or error.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results as a single concatenated string in input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any additional characters.

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input snippets, and nothing else.**
