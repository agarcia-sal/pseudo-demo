Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, carefully and independently evaluate each snippet to determine if it is **fully reproducible—that is, guaranteed to pass all unit tests for all valid inputs of its problem domain when implemented exactly as given**.

Your assessment must confirm, without compromise, that each snippet meets **every** one of the following essential requirements:

1. **Explicit completeness:**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, and data structures are clearly and fully defined with precise, implementable types or descriptions.  
   - Initialization and setup steps are explicitly stated, leaving no implicit assumptions or missing details.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic instructions:**  
   - Every operation and control flow statement (arithmetic, logical, assignment, conditionals, loops, recursion, function calls) is crystal-clear and fully specified with no ambiguity or required inference.  
   - There is no use of randomness, external nondeterminism, or hidden side effects.

3. **Robust input coverage:**  
   - All possible valid inputs—including edge cases such as empty or null inputs, boundary values, and exceptional scenarios—are addressed explicitly or by logical implication that guarantees safe, correct handling without undefined or inconsistent behavior.

4. **Self-contained correctness:**  
   - The snippet’s correctness relies solely on the provided pseudocode content, requiring no external context, assumptions, environment details, or undocumented conventions.

5. **Implementation-ready clarity and deterministic behavior:**  
   - Any skilled programmer can implement the snippet exactly as written to produce consistent and correct results every time for the same inputs.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one digit:  
  - **1** if the snippet satisfies _all_ above criteria in every respect, fully guaranteeing reproducibility.  
  - **0** if it fails in even one aspect—introducing ambiguity, incompleteness, assumptions, or nondeterminism.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output the digits strictly in the order the pseudocodes appear, concatenated with no spaces, line breaks, or extra characters.

**Produce no explanations, reasoning, or any output other than the requested concatenated digits.**
