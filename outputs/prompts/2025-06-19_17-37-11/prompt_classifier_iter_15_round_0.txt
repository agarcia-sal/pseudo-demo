Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, perform a precise and exhaustive reproducibility assessment for each snippet against **all possible valid inputs and scenarios** in its problem domain. Your goal is to determine if an exact, literal implementation of the snippet will **always pass every relevant unit test without exception**.

For each snippet, verify that it simultaneously fulfills **all** of these stringent requirements:

1. **Exhaustive clarity and completeness:**  
 - Every input, output, variable, constant, and data structure is explicitly and unambiguously defined, including data types or precise informal descriptions sufficient for direct implementation.  
 - Initialization steps, assumptions, invariants, and preconditions must be fully stated; no implicit knowledge or hidden dependencies allowed.

2. **Deterministic and fully specified behavior:**  
 - Every computation, operation, control flow statement (if, loops, switches, recursion), and function call is described concretely, precisely, and without ambiguity or underspecification.  
 - No randomness, external dependencies, environment/state reliance, concurrency, timing ambiguity, or underspecified side effects.

3. **Complete input domain coverage:**  
 - The snippet clearly accounts for **every** valid input case, including standard, boundary, minimal, maximal, empty, null, or exceptional inputs.  
 - No inputs lead to undefined, erroneous, or unspecified behavior under any circumstances.

4. **Context-independence and self-containment:**  
 - The snippet must be implementable as-is, without requiring external code, undocumented assumptions, environment-specific features, or runtime conditions beyond the provided pseudocode.

5. **Implementation feasibility and consistency:**  
 - A competent programmer, using standard programming constructs, can directly translate the snippet into runnable code that will always behave identically and correctly according to the specification, producing consistent results on every execution with the same inputs.

**Output format:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet in input order: output a single digit—  
 - **1** if it passes all these criteria and thus guarantees passing **all** unit tests unconditionally.  
 - **0** if it fails any criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing cases, implicit assumptions, or context dependence.  
- Output all digits concatenated together, with no spaces, newlines, markers, or additional characters.

**Do not provide explanations, reasoning, formatting, or any other output besides this exact sequence of digits.**
