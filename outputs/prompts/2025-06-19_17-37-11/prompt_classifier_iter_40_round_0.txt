Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning every faithful implementation thereof **always passes all valid unit tests across the entire problem domain without exception**.

For each snippet, assign:  
- `1` if and only if the snippet meets **all** these strict, unconditional criteria:  

 1. **Complete, unambiguous definition:** Inputs, outputs, all variables, data structures, constants, and initial conditions are explicitly, fully specified with zero undefined elements or hidden assumptions.

 2. **Deterministic and fully precise steps:** Every operation, control flow construct, and function call is described such that it is perfectly deterministic, side-effect free (except those explicitly modeled), and unvarying across implementations; no reliance on external or mutable state, randomness, or implicit behaviors.

 3. **Exhaustive, correct coverage:** The logic explicitly or implicitly ensures correct, well-defined behavior on **all valid inputs** including edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional inputs, with no partial, undefined, or erroneous cases.

 4. **Entirely self-contained and implementation-ready:** No external dependencies, environment assumptions, or undocumented contexts are necessary; the snippet can be implemented exactly as given without inference or supplementation.

 5. **Consistent and reliable outputs:** For identical inputs, any faithful implementation of the snippet produces **the same, correct output** every time, guaranteeing passing of all unit tests that validate the specified problem.

- `0` if **any** of these conditions fail due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, uncovered inputs, external dependencies, or output inconsistency.

---

**Output format:**  
- For `N` snippets, output exactly `N` characters (`1` or `0`), concatenated **in input order**, without spaces, newlines, or any other characters.  
- Output nothing else—no explanations, whitespace, headings, or delimiters beyond the digit sequence.
