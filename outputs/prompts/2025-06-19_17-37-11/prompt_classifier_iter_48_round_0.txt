Given one or more pseudocode snippets delimited below, determine for each snippet whether it is **strictly reproducible**, meaning that **any faithful implementation of that snippet will deterministically pass all valid unit tests for every possible input across the entire problem domain, without error, exception, ambiguity, or non-determinism.**

To decide reproducibility, confirm **all** of the following conditions are met **without exception** for each snippet:

1. **Complete and explicit specification:** The snippet explicitly defines all inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, initial states, and preconditions—all fully specified, leaving no assumptions, hidden contexts, or underspecified elements.

2. **Precise, deterministic, and unambiguous logic:** Every operation—including assignments, control flow structures (loops, conditionals, recursion), function calls, and data manipulations—is described with exact clarity and without ambiguity, randomness, concurrency, or dependence on external mutable state or side effects.

3. **Exhaustive domain correctness:** The snippet guarantees fully correct, well-defined, and terminating behavior for every valid input, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, exceptional inputs, and all degenerate scenarios, with no undefined, partial, or error-prone behavior.

4. **Self-contained and implementation-independent:** The snippet includes all necessary information and logic within itself, without reliance on external definitions, environments, assumptions, or unprovided procedures; it must be directly implementable as-is without external supplementation.

5. **Deterministic, consistent output:** Any implementation strictly following the snippet will always produce identical outputs for identical inputs, on every invocation, reliably passing every valid unit test designed for the problem.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet given, output exactly one digit:  
 - `1` if it fulfills **all** the above reproducibility criteria unconditionally.  
 - `0` if it violates or fails **any one or more** criteria due to underspecification, ambiguity, non-determinism, incomplete domain handling, external dependencies, or logical inconsistency.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output the binary results concatenated directly in input order without spaces, line breaks, or any other characters.  

**Output nothing except this concatenated string of digits. No explanations, no formatting, no whitespace, no additional text or symbols.**
