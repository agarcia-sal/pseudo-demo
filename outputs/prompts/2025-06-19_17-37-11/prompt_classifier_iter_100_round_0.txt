Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—meaning it can be implemented exactly as provided to produce correct, deterministic, and repeatable outputs that will pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input without ambiguity, incompleteness, or external dependencies.

Your judgment must consider all of the following comprehensive factors:

1. **Complete and Explicit Definition:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, and initialization is explicitly stated or clearly inferable without assumptions. Input domains and constraints are either explicitly given or logically deducible from the snippet alone.

2. **Precise, Unambiguous Logic:** All operations, control flows (branches, loops, recursion), data manipulations, and calculations are described clearly and deterministically, with no implicit steps, randomness, external state dependencies, side effects, or undefined behavior.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage:** The snippet accounts for all valid inputs—including edge cases and boundary conditions—and guarantees no runtime errors, undefined states, infinite loops, or exceptions for any valid input set.

4. **Complete Self-Containment:** The snippet requires no external code, libraries, environment variables, or unstated context; it is entirely implementable as provided.

5. **Deterministic and Consistent Output:** For identical inputs, outputs remain consistent and reproducible across all executions.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet meets *all five* criteria flawlessly, ensuring it can be directly implemented to pass all unit tests with no ambiguity or errors.  
  - `0` if the snippet fails *any* criterion for any reason (ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing coverage, external dependencies, etc.).  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results concatenated in input order as a single string containing only `1`s and `0`s, with no spaces, newlines, or additional characters.

**Do not provide explanations, notes, or any output other than the concatenated sequence of `1`s and `0`s.**
