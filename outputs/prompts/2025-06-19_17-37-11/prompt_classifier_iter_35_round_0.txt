Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **fully reproducible**, defined as follows: any correct and faithful implementation of that snippet will always produce the exact expected output on **all valid inputs** in its domain, passing **every relevant unit test without exception**.

For each snippet, output `1` if and only if **all** of the conditions below hold **categorically and without ambiguity**; otherwise, output `0`. When multiple snippets are provided, output digits concatenated in input order, nothing else.

Evaluate each snippet against these criteria:

1. **Complete specification:** All inputs, outputs, variable initializations, data structures, constants, preconditions, and edge cases are explicitly and unambiguously detailed, with no missing or implicit components.

2. **Deterministic and precise procedure:** Every operation, control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion), computation, and function call is specified clearly and deterministically, free from implicit randomness, side effects, concurrency issues, or reliance on any external or mutable state not described in the snippet.

3. **Correctness and totality on input domain:** The snippet’s logic covers all valid inputs including boundary, edge, and exceptional cases, guaranteeing well-defined, correct outputs for every possible input in the problem domain.

4. **Self-contained and implementable:** The snippet contains all necessary information to implement it exactly as described, without needing external context, assumptions, unstated dependencies, or external resources.

5. **Reproducible outputs:** The snippet’s behavior is inherently reproducible—any faithfully implemented version produces consistent, identical outputs for the same inputs, ensuring guaranteed success on the full unit test suite.

**Output instructions:**  
- Output exactly one digit per pseudocode snippet:  
 - `1` if the snippet meets **all** above conditions strictly and guarantees reproducibility.  
 - `0` otherwise.  
- If multiple snippets are provided, output their digits concatenated directly, with no spaces, newlines, or extra characters.  
- Provide **no explanations or additional text**, only the concise digit sequence.
