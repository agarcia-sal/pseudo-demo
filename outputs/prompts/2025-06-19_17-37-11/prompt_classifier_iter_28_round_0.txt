Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet if it is **unconditionally reproducible**—meaning that **every** correct and faithful implementation of the pseudocode will always produce the exact, fully correct output for **all valid inputs**, passing **all possible unit tests** exhaustively, without errors, nondeterminism, ambiguity, or incomplete behavior.

To decide reproducibility, for each snippet rigorously confirm **all** of the following, with absolute certainty and no exceptions:

1. **Explicit completeness:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, and initial condition is completely and precisely defined within the snippet; no implicit assumptions or missing definitions exist.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous instructions:** Every computational step, including control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion), operations, and function calls, is described with absolute clarity and determinism—no dependence on randomness, external state, timing, concurrency, or unspecified behavior.

3. **Total correctness over full input domain:** The snippet explicitly or implicitly accounts for every valid input (including boundary, empty, special, and error cases), guaranteeing correct, defined behavior without exceptions, partial cases, undefined results, or failure modes.

4. **Fully self-contained implementation:** The snippet includes or implies all necessary information to implement it exactly as-is, with no need for external assumptions, unstated context, initialization routines, or auxiliary procedures.

5. **Output consistency and correctness:** Any precise implementation of the snippet produces exactly the same correct output for the same input every time, fully passing every unit test applicable to the problem’s domain.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each provided pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
 - `1` if **all** above criteria are met unconditionally, guaranteeing reproducibility.  
 - `0` if **any** criterion is not met, including ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing input coverage, unstated assumptions, or any uncertainty.  
- When multiple pseudocode snippets are given, output their digits concatenated **sequentially, with no spaces, newlines, or any extra characters**.  
- **Output nothing else. No explanations, no formatting, no whitespace.**
