Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, your task is to determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”meaning it can be implemented exactly as given to produce correct, consistent outputs that pass all unit tests for every valid input without fail. To decide this, systematically verify that the snippet meets **all** of the following rigorous, essential criteria:

1. **Explicit completeness:** The pseudocode fully defines all inputs (including valid input domains), outputs, variables, constants, data structures, and initial states without leaving anything implicit or assumed. Preconditions and edge conditions must be clearly specified or clearly derivable from the pseudocode itself.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic logic:** Every computational step, control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion), and data manipulation is described with precise, unambiguous semantics. There is no randomness, concurrency, external dependencies, implicit state, or side effects that could affect behavior between different runs on the same input.

3. **Robust edge-case handling:** The logic explicitly accounts for all boundary conditions, exceptional inputs, and corner cases, ensuring no possibility of runtime errors, undefined behavior, or incorrect outputs for any valid input.

4. **Self-contained and independent:** The snippet relies solely on the constructs and definitions provided within it. It has no dependencies on external code, libraries, global/environmental state, or context outside the pseudocode given.

5. **Deterministic reproducibility:** For identical inputs, the same outputs are guaranteed consistently with no variation. This ensures that unit tests are reproducibly passed every time the algorithm is implemented based on the pseudocode.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet satisfies **all** the above criteria entirely and unconditionally, guaranteeing successful, deterministic passage of all valid unit tests;  
  - `0` otherwise (if any criterion is not fully met due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge cases, hidden dependencies, or other sources of uncertainty or error).  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their results as a single concatenated string in the input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any extra characters.

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1` and `0` characters, strictly corresponding to the input snippets, and nothing else.**
