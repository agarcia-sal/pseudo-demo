Given one or more pseudocode snippets delimited below, output a single digit for each snippet—`1` if the snippet is **fully reproducible**, or `0` otherwise. Output digits must be concatenated in input order with no separators or extra characters.

A snippet is **fully reproducible** only if **every** one of the following conditions is met **absolutely** and **without exception**:

1. **Complete explicit specification:** The snippet explicitly and unambiguously defines all inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, initialization, preconditions, and any relevant assumptions. Nothing is left implicit or undefined.

2. **Deterministic and exact procedural description:** All operations—including control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion), calculations, and called subroutines—are precisely and exhaustively described with no ambiguity, randomness, external mutable dependencies, or contextual requirements beyond the snippet itself.

3. **Guaranteed correctness over entire input space:** The snippet correctly handles every possible valid input, including normal, boundary, degenerate, and exceptional cases. No input leads to undefined, partial, or erroneous behavior.

4. **Self-contained and context-independent:** The snippet can be implemented and executed exactly as given, without any external or environment assumptions, hidden state, or external resources.

5. **Deterministic and consistent output adherence:** Any faithful implementation of the snippet produces identical, repeatable outputs across all runs for identical inputs and passes all valid unit tests covering the entire problem domain.

**Output rules:**  
- For each snippet, output only one character:  
 - `1` if it meets *all* above criteria strictly.  
 - `0` if it fails *any* criterion (ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing coverage, implicit assumptions, or uncertainty).  
- If multiple snippets are provided, output their corresponding digits concatenated immediately, with no whitespace, newlines, explanations, or any other output.
