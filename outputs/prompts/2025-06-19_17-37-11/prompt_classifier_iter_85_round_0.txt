Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, **for each snippet, determine whether it is fully reproducible**—meaning it can be directly implemented exactly as given to produce correct, deterministic outputs that will pass every unit test for all valid inputs—by rigorously verifying **all** of the following:

1. **Complete explicit definition:** Every input, output, variable, constant, data structure, and initial state is clearly and fully specified without reliance on unstated assumptions or external context. The valid input domain and preconditions are clearly defined or unambiguously implied.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic logic:** All operations, control flows (branches, loops, recursion), and computations are described precisely with no ambiguity, nondeterminism, randomness, or hidden effects. The pseudocode uses only well-defined constructs and behaviors.

3. **Full correctness coverage:** The snippet explicitly and correctly accounts for all valid inputs—including normal cases, boundary conditions, and edge cases—and guarantees no runtime errors, exceptions, infinite loops, or undefined states.

4. **Self-contained with no external dependencies:** The snippet can be implemented exactly as-is without requiring any external libraries, global states, environment variables, platform-specific behavior, or external information beyond what is provided.

5. **Consistent and repeatable outputs:** Given identical inputs, the snippet will always produce exactly the same outputs, ensuring reproducibility and unit test determinism.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character as follows:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet unconditionally satisfies **all** the above criteria, guaranteeing it will deterministically pass all unit tests for all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if it fails **any** criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge handling, implicit dependencies, or any uncertainty preventing guaranteed unit test success.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results as a contiguous string matching their input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any additional characters.

**Your final response must be solely this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input snippets. No other text or formatting is permitted.**
