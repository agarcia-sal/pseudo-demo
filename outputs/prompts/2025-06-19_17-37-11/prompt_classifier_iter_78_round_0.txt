Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, evaluate each snippet individually and output a 1 if and only if it satisfies **all** the following rigorous criteria guaranteeing it is fully reproducible—meaning that an exact implementation derived from it would pass **all** unit tests with **correct, consistent, and deterministic outputs on every valid input**—otherwise output 0:

1. **Explicit and complete specification:** The snippet fully defines all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and any preconditions or input constraints with zero ambiguity or omissions. No information essential for correct implementation or validation is implicit or missing.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic logic:** Every operation, control flow branch, loop, recursion, arithmetic or logical computation, and data manipulation is precisely and clearly described so that the behavior is fixed, deterministic, and reproducible. The snippet contains no randomness, external/global dependencies, hidden states, or unspecified behaviors.

3. **Comprehensive edge case and error handling:** The logic explicitly and correctly accounts for all valid inputs including boundary conditions, corner cases, exceptional or degenerate scenarios, and avoids runtime errors or undefined states on any allowed input.

4. **Self-contained and implementation-agnostic:** The snippet can be directly implemented exactly as written without relying on any external libraries, frameworks, global/environmental variables or settings, or assumptions about the runtime environment.

5. **Deterministic and consistent output:** For identical inputs, the snippet guarantees the exact same outputs every time, ensuring full reproducibility and deterministic unit test success.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet satisfies **all** criteria above without exception  
  - `0` if the snippet fails to meet **any** criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case coverage, implicit dependencies, or any source of unreproducibility or error  
- When multiple snippets are given as input, output a concatenated string of 1s and 0s in the exact order the snippets are presented, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or extra characters.

**Respond strictly and only with the concatenated string of digits (`1` and `0`) representing each input snippet, and nothing else.**
