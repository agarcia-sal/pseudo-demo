Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be precisely implemented from the pseudocode alone to consistently produce correct outputs that would pass all unit tests for every valid input without fail. Your decision must be based on verifying **all** the following, without exception:

1. **Complete and explicit definition:** Inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and preconditions are fully and unambiguously specified within the snippet, with no missing, implicit, or assumed elements or external context.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous logic:** All operations, control flow (including loops, conditionals, and recursion), and computations are clearly and precisely described. There must be no randomness, external dependencies, undefined or implicit behaviors, side effects, or nondeterministic elements.

3. **Full correctness coverage:** The snippet’s logic correctly handles every valid input, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios, ensuring no runtime errors, undefined results, or incomplete handling.

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:** The snippet can be implemented exactly as given without relying on any unstated external libraries, global variables, environment configurations, or additional context beyond what is provided in the pseudocode.

5. **Consistent outputs on repeated runs:** For identical inputs, the snippet will reliably produce identical outputs every time, guaranteeing reproducible results that pass every applicable unit test.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if it fully satisfies **all** the above criteria, ensuring deterministic, complete, and reproducible implementation and unit test success.  
  - `0` if it fails to meet **any** single criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, partial edge case coverage, external dependencies, or any source of uncertainty or error.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results concatenated in the input order with no spaces, line breaks, explanations, or additional characters.

**Respond *only* with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input snippets, and nothing else.**
