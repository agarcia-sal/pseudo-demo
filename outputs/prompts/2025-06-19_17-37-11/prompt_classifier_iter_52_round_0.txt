Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, determine for each snippet **whether it is fully reproducible**, meaning that any correct and faithful implementation derived solely from that snippet will **unconditionally pass all unit tests without fail for every valid input**, producing correct, deterministic outputs every time.

To decide if a snippet is reproducible, confirm it meets **all** of the following strict criteria **without exception**:

1. **Complete and explicit specification:** The snippet defines all inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, initialization, and preconditions explicitly, with zero omissions, ambiguities, or unstated assumptions.

2. **Precise, deterministic logic:** Every operation, decision, and control flow (including loops, recursion, and conditionals) is unambiguously described; no randomness, side effects, external mutable dependencies, partial definitions, or unspecified behavior appear anywhere.

3. **Provably correct across full input domain:** The snippet guarantees correct, well-defined handling for every possible valid input, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional inputs, without undefined, partial, or incomplete responses.

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:** No reliance on external context, hidden state, unspecified libraries, or assumptions beyond the snippet itself; it must be implementable exactly as given.

5. **Deterministic, stable outputs:** Running any conforming implementation repeatedly with identical inputs will always yield identical outputs, ensuring reproducibility and consistent unit test success.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet given, output exactly one character:  
 - `1` if the snippet satisfies **all** above conditions categorically and guarantees reproducible, fully correct results.  
 - `0` if it fails **any** single condition due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case coverage, implicit external dependencies, or any uncertainty.  
- When given multiple snippets, output their results in order, concatenated directly, with no spaces, newlines, or any additional characters.

**Do not provide any explanations, comments, formatting, or whitespace. Output only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input order.**
