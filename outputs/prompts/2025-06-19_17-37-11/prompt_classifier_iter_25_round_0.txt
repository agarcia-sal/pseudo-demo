Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, for each snippet determine if it is **strictly reproducible**, meaning that any accurate implementation following **exclusively** the snippet’s textual content will produce a correct, fully deterministic solution passing **all valid unit tests on every possible input within the problem domain, without fail.**

Assess each snippet against these **non-negotiable criteria**:

1. **Explicit definition:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and preconditions must be unequivocally specified. There must be no assumptions, implicit knowledge, or missing details anywhere.

2. **Deterministic precision:** Every step — including computations, branching logic, loops, recursion, function calls, and state changes — must be exhaustively and unambiguously described. No operations rely on randomness, external state, timing variations, or hidden side effects.

3. **Complete input space handling:** The snippet guarantees well-defined, correct behavior for every valid input conceivable within the problem domain: typical, boundary, extreme, empty, null, or exceptional cases. No input should cause undefined, partial, or incorrect execution.

4. **Fully self-contained:** The snippet stands alone; it requires no external context, environment, or supplemental information beyond what is presented. Any dependencies or assumptions must be explicitly included.

5. **Implementation equivalence:** Any competent developer can implement the snippet exactly as given and obtain identical, correct outputs on every run for identical inputs, thus passing all tests reliably.

**Output mode:**  
- For each snippet, output exactly one character:  
 - **1** if the snippet meets *all* the above conditions, ensuring reproducibility.  
 - **0** otherwise (i.e., if any condition fails due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing input coverage, implicit assumptions, or external dependencies).  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their respective digits concatenated **directly**, preserving input order with no spaces, line breaks, or extra characters.

**After the pseudocode(s) block, output ONLY the concatenated 1/0 string in exact order — absolutely nothing else.**
