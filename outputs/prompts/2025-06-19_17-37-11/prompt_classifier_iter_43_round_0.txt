Given one or more pseudocode snippets delimited below, determine for each snippet if it is **guaranteed fully reproducible**, meaning that **any correct and faithful implementation strictly following that snippet will deterministically pass all valid unit tests on every input in its problem domain without exception.**

To assign reproducibility (`1`) or non-reproducibility (`0`), *rigorously verify* **all** of the following for every snippet without exception:

1. **Complete and explicit definition:** All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, initialization states, and preconditions are fully and explicitly specified. No assumptions, implicit context, or omitted details remain.

2. **Deterministic, unambiguous instructions:** Every operation and control structure (including loops, conditionals, recursion), arithmetic or logical computation, and invoked procedure is fully and precisely described. There is zero ambiguity, randomness, nondeterminism, or dependence on external or mutable state outside the snippet.

3. **Exhaustive correctness over entire input space:** The snippet accounts for every possible valid input—normal, boundary, edge, and degenerate cases—providing fully defined and correct outputs. There is no partial, undefined, or exceptional behavior left untreated.

4. **Self-sufficiency and environment-independence:** The snippet is entirely self-contained, requiring no external definitions, libraries, specifications, defaults, or environmental context beyond what is presented.

5. **Deterministic output reproducibility:** Every correct implementation strictly following the snippet must produce identical outputs on repeated executions with the same inputs, reliably passing all unit tests without fail.

**Instructions for output:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one digit:  
 - `1` if it satisfies **all five** criteria and guarantees complete reproducible correctness.  
 - `0` if it fails **any** criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing coverage, reliance on external context, or uncertainty.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their digits concatenated in the exact order the snippets appear, *with no spaces, newlines, or any other characters*.

**Output only the concatenated sequence of `1`s and `0`s. Nothing else. No explanations, no formatting, no extra whitespace, no metadata.**
