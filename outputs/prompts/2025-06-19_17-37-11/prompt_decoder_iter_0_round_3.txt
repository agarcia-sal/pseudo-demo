Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and idiomatic Python code, focusing on full correctness, clarity, and efficiency.  
- Enclose the entire code within a single Python code block using triple backticks, formatted as:  
  ```python  
  # your translated code here  
  ```  
- Use plain input() calls without prompts (e.g., input(), not input("prompt")).  
- Ensure the code is ready to run directly and handles all inputs and outputs as per the pseudocode logic.  
- Avoid extraneous text, comments only where helpful for clarity if needed.  
- You may utilize any standard Python libraries or packages to improve robustness or conciseness.  
- Prioritize producing the best possible, fully working solution within the 5-second execution constraint.  
- Do not include separator lines or unnecessary formatting outside the code block.
