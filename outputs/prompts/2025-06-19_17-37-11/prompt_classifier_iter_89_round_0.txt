Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each whether it is fully reproducible, defined as being directly and unambiguously implementable exactly as written to produce correct, deterministic outputs that pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input without exception.

Evaluate each snippet against these comprehensive, mandatory criteria:

1. **Explicit and Complete Definition:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial states must be fully and precisely specified within the snippet. No details may be omitted or ambiguous. Input constraints and assumptions must be either explicitly stated or clearly derivable from the pseudocode itself.

2. **Precise, Unambiguous Logic:** Every step including assignments, control flow, calculations, and data manipulation must be described clearly, leaving no room for interpretation or guesswork. The logic must exclude randomness, hidden dependencies, external influences, side effects, or undefined operations.

3. **Total Valid Input Coverage:** The snippet’s logic must properly handle every possible valid input, including edge cases and corner scenarios, ensuring no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined behaviors occur for any admissible input.

4. **Complete Self-Containment:** The snippet must be standalone, not depending on external code, global/environmental state, libraries, or unstated context. It must be implementable exactly as provided, with no external assumptions.

5. **Deterministic and Consistent Outcome:** For the same input, the snippet must produce identical outputs every time with no variability.

---

**Output rules:**  
- Output a single character per snippet:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet meets *all* five criteria perfectly, guaranteeing reproducible correctness against all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if the snippet violates *any* criterion by introducing uncertainty, incompleteness, nondeterminism, or external dependency.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their respective results concatenated in input order, without spaces, line breaks, or extra characters.

**Strictly output only this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s — absolutely no explanations, commentary, or additional text.**
