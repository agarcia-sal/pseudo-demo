Given one or more pseudocode snippets separated distinctly, determine for each snippet if it is **fully reproducible** as per the strictest interpretation of reproducibility defined below.  
**Fully reproducible** means: *any conforming implementation of the snippet, without modification or added assumptions, will always produce correct, deterministic outputs that pass every valid unit test for every possible input in the problem domain without exception or ambiguity.*  

For each snippet, evaluate **all** of the following, and assign the snippet a value:  
- `1` if **and only if** every criterion below is unequivocally met.  
- `0` if **any** criterion is violated, even partially.  

---

### Criteria for full reproducibility (must be unconditionally satisfied):

1. **Complete specification:**  
   - All inputs, outputs, internal states, variables, data structures, constants, and preconditions are explicitly and exhaustively defined.  
   - No implicit assumptions, omitted cases, or hidden dependencies.

2. **Precise and deterministic steps:**  
   - Every operation, control structure, and invoked procedure is described with exact detail allowing *only one* interpretation.  
   - No nondeterministic behavior (randomness, concurrency, external mutable states) or context-dependent elements.

3. **Correctness over entire valid input domain:**  
   - The snippet's logic correctly handles every input value, including edge cases, boundary conditions, exceptional and degenerate inputs, producing fully defined outputs.  
   - No partial, undefined, or error-prone behaviors remain.

4. **Self-contained and independent:**  
   - The snippet can be faithfully implemented using only the given description.  
   - No reliance on external algorithms, data, environment configurations, or unstated assumptions.

5. **Guaranteed reproducibility and test-passing output:**  
   - Any implementation following this snippet exactly will produce stable, identical results on repeated runs with identical inputs.  
   - The output behavior strictly conforms to passing all conceivable unit tests for the problem.

### Output instructions:  
- For each snippet, output exactly one character:  
  `1` if the snippet **fully meets all criteria** above.  
  `0` if it fails any criterion.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their corresponding digits in order, concatenated with no spaces, delimiters, or extra characters.  
- Output nothing else—not explanations, summaries, whitespace, or commentary.
