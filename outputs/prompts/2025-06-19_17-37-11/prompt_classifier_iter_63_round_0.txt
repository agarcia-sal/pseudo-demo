Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, **for each snippet, determine with absolute certainty whether it is reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as provided to produce correct, consistent, and deterministic outputs that pass all unit tests for every valid input without exception**.

To decide reproducibility, assess rigorously and conclusively the following dimensions:

1. **Complete and precise definition:** Every element required to implement the snippet must be fully specified, including all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial values, and assumptions. There must be no implicit or missing information, unstated preconditions, or vague terms. Input domains or constraints must be clearly stated or reliably derivable from the pseudocode.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous behavior:** The control flow (conditions, loops, recursion), operations, and data transformations must be explicitly and unambiguously defined, without any nondeterminism, randomness, hidden state dependencies, race conditions, or reliance on any external mutable environment or side effects.

3. **Comprehensive input coverage:** The logic must handle all valid inputs—including typical cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios—without any gaps, undefined states, or potential runtime errors. No valid input should cause failure, undefined behavior, or partial correctness.

4. **Self-sufficiency and isolation:** The pseudocode must be entirely self-contained and implementable without any external libraries, frameworks, environment variables, global states, or implicit assumptions beyond what is provided inline. All dependencies must be transparent and included.

5. **Reproducibility and consistency:** For any given input, the snippet must always produce the exact same output deterministically, ensuring repeated executions yield identical unit test results.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one character:  
   - `1` if—without any doubt—the snippet fulfills **all** above criteria completely, thus guaranteeing it will pass all unit tests deterministically for every valid input.  
   - `0` if it fails to meet **any** of the criteria for any reason, including ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit knowledge, nondeterminism, incomplete edge case coverage, or hidden external dependencies.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their results as a single contiguous string matching the input order, without spaces, newlines, additional characters, or explanations.  

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1` and `0` corresponding exactly to the snippets in the input and nothing else.**
