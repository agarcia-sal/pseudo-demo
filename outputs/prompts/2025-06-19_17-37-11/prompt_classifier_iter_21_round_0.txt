Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine **for each snippet independently** whether it is **fully reproducible**, meaning that an exact implementation following the pseudocode will pass **all** valid unit tests for every possible input in its problem domain, without error or ambiguity.

To output **1**, the snippet must satisfy **all** of the following conditions precisely:

1. **Explicit completeness:**  
 - All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, and data structures are defined unambiguously with clear, implementable types or descriptions.  
 - Initialization and setup steps, including preconditions and invariants, are fully stated; no requirements or assumptions are implicit or omitted.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous instructions:**  
 - Every operation (arithmetic, logical, control flow, recursion, function calls) is specified clearly and explicitly, with no alternative interpretations or reliance on unspecified behavior.  
 - No use of randomness, external state, concurrency, side-effects, or nondeterministic elements.

3. **Exhaustive input coverage and error handling:**  
 - The snippet explicitly or intrinsically covers all valid inputs, including normal cases, edge values (empty, null, minimal, maximal inputs), and exceptional or boundary conditions.  
 - No inputs can produce undefined behavior, runtime errors, or unspecified outputs.

4. **Self-contained correctness:**  
 - The snippet requires no external definitions, context, environment assumptions, or undocumented conventions to function as intended and produce correct results.

5. **Implementation-ready clarity:**  
 - A competent programmer can produce a faithful, reproducible implementation that consistently passes all unit tests on every execution with the same inputs.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one digit—**1** if the snippet meets all above requirements for reproducibility, **0** otherwise.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their corresponding digits **in the same order**, concatenated with no separators, whitespace, or additional characters.  
- Output **only** the resulting concatenated digits, nothing else—no explanations, no reasoning, no formatting.
