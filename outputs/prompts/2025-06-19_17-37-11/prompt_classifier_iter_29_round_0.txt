Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet if it is unconditionally **reproducible**, meaning that every correct implementation derived solely from the snippet will always produce the correct, fully deterministic output and pass **all valid unit tests on every input** in its problem domain, without exception.

For each snippet, **output 1 if and only if all the following are strictly true without exception; otherwise output 0**:

1. **Explicit completeness:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and any necessary initializations are fully specified and unambiguous. There are no missing details, implicit assumptions, or required external definitions.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous logic:** Every operation—control flow (conditions, loops, recursion), computations, and calls—is precisely defined with no ambiguity, probabilistic behavior, or reliance on external or mutable state.

3. **Comprehensive correctness:** The snippet guarantees correct, well-defined behavior on every valid input, including edge cases and exceptional inputs, with no unspecified, partial, or undefined behavior.

4. **Self-contained implementability:** The snippet can be implemented exactly as given without any external context, environment, or hidden information beyond what is explicitly provided.

5. **Consistent reproducibility:** Any faithful implementation based solely on this snippet will yield the same correct output for the same input every time, thus passing all corresponding unit tests perfectly.

**Output rules:**  
- For _each_ snippet, output a single digit:  
 - `1` if all conditions above hold strictly and unconditionally.  
 - `0` if any condition fails or is questionable in any way.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their digits concatenated directly in the order the snippets appear.  
- Output exactly this sequence of digits, nothing else—no spaces, line breaks, explanation, or extra characters.
