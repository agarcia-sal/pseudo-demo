Given the pseudocode below, perform a rigorous, step-by-step analysis to determine if it is fully reproducible—that is, whether the pseudocode as provided contains *all* necessary details and clarity to be implemented exactly as is, guaranteeing correct, deterministic, and consistent behavior that will pass *every* valid unit test across the entire input domain:

To decide if the pseudocode is reproducible, verify and confirm **all** of the following criteria without exception:

- **Complete definitions:** Inputs, outputs, variables, constants, and data structures are explicitly named, typed (when applicable), and initialized or described in a fully unambiguous way.

- **Precise operations:** Each step—including assignments, calculations, conditionals, loops, and function calls—is clearly described, deterministic, and unambiguous, with no missing details or assumptions.

- **Exhaustive logic coverage:** The pseudocode explicitly handles *all* valid input cases, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios, with no behavioral gaps or undefined states.

- **No external dependencies:** The solution’s correctness does not depend on assumptions outside the pseudocode itself—no unstated constraints, external knowledge, or subjective interpretation required.

- **Implementation-ready clarity:** A developer could write a fully correct and working implementation solely from the pseudocode, with no guesswork, interpretation, or additional information needed.

After completing this analysis, output a single digit per pseudocode snippet, strictly as follows:

- Output **1** if *every* criterion above is fully met and reproducibility is guaranteed.  
- Output **0** if *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, logical error, or missing detail prevents guaranteed reproducibility.

If evaluating multiple pseudocode snippets in sequence, output the sequence of digits concatenated *exactly in the input order*, with no spaces, newlines, or any other characters.

Do not provide any other text, explanation, or formatting beyond this output.
