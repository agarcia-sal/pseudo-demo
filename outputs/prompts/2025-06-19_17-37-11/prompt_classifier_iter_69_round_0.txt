Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, determine for each snippet whether it is fully **reproducible**—meaning it can be implemented exactly as given to consistently produce correct outputs that pass all unit tests for every valid input without exception. To classify reproducibility, strictly verify the following five pillars for each snippet:

1. **Explicit and comprehensive specification:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial states are clearly and completely defined with no ambiguity or missing elements. Any preconditions or input constraints must be explicit or logically deducible from the snippet.

2. **Precise, deterministic behavior:** Every operation is described unambiguously, including control flow (conditions, loops, recursion), data manipulations, and computations. There exists no nondeterminism, randomness, external or hidden dependencies, side effects, or undefined behaviors.

3. **Complete input domain handling:** The pseudocode explicitly accounts for all valid inputs, including typical, edge, boundary, and exceptional cases, ensuring no runtime errors or undefined states for any valid input.

4. **Fully self-contained and context-independent:** Implementation requires no assumptions beyond the given pseudocode—no external libraries, global state, environment variables, or implicit context are needed.

5. **Consistent outputs on repeated runs:** For identical inputs, the output is guaranteed to be exactly the same on every execution, enabling deterministic and repeatable unit test success.

**Output instructions:**  
- For *each* pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if **all five pillars are strictly satisfied** for that snippet, ensuring deterministic, test-passing reproducibility.  
  - `0` otherwise (failing any pillar due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, implicit context, or other flaws).  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output results concatenated in their input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or extra characters.

**Your final response should be only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding exactly to the order of the input snippets. Do not include anything else.**
