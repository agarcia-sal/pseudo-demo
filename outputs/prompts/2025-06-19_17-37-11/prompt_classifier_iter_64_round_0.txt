Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, **for each snippet output exactly one digit—`1` if it is fully reproducible, or `0` if not—according to the following rigorous, all-encompassing reproducibility evaluation:**

**Definition of reproducible:** The pseudocode can be implemented exactly as given to produce correct, consistent, and deterministic outputs that pass *all* unit tests on *every* valid input.

---

**Evaluation criteria (all must hold without exception for output `1`):**

1. **Explicit completeness:**  
 • Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, and initial state is unambiguously specified with no gaps or assumptions.  
 • Valid input domains and preconditions are clearly defined or logically inferable from the snippet itself.  

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous operations:**  
 • All control structures (branches, loops, recursion) and calculations are fully and precisely described.  
 • No nondeterminism, randomness, external dependencies, hidden side effects, or environment reliance exists.  

3. **Full logical coverage:**  
 • Every valid input scenario, including boundary values and exceptional cases, is explicitly or logically handled to prevent runtime errors, infinite loops, undefined behavior, or incorrect outputs.  

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:**  
 • The snippet stands alone and can be implemented without any external libraries, frameworks, globals, or contextual assumptions beyond what is given.  

5. **Guaranteed consistent outputs:**  
 • Identical inputs always produce exactly the same outputs, ensuring deterministic reproducibility and consistent unit test success.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if it fully satisfies *all* the above criteria without exception.  
  - `0` if it fails to meet *any* criterion, including any ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, or implicit/unverifiable dependencies.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results concatenated in the order given, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or extra characters.  

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input snippets and nothing else.**
