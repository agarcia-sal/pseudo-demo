Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each whether it is **strictly reproducible**, meaning that any correct and faithful implementation of the snippet:

- deterministically produces the fully correct output,
- passes **all valid unit tests for every possible input** in its specified domain,  
- and does so unconditionally without relying on hidden assumptions or external factors.

For each snippet, assign `1` only if **all** of the following rigorously hold without exception; otherwise, assign `0`:

1. **Complete specification:** Every input, output, variable, constant, data structure, initial state, and constraint is explicitly defined and unambiguous, with no missing or implicit details.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous logic:** All steps—including control flow, operations, function calls, and data manipulations—are precisely described, yield no randomness or side effects, and depend solely on defined inputs and internal state.

3. **Correctness for entire input space:** The snippet demonstrates correct, well-defined behavior for *every* valid input, including edge cases and exceptional scenarios, guaranteeing no partial, undefined, or erroneous outputs.

4. **Self-contained and context-free:** The snippet requires no external environment, assumptions, prior declarations, or hidden knowledge beyond what is explicitly given.

5. **Guaranteed reproducibility:** Any faithful implementation based solely on the snippet produces the same correct output for any given input, ensuring that all valid unit tests will pass.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each snippet, output a single digit:  
 `1` if reproducible under all conditions above, else `0`.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their digits consecutively with **no spaces, newlines, or extra characters**.  
- The output order matches the input order of pseudocode snippets.  
- **No explanations, comments, or formatting beyond these digits are allowed.**
