Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, perform an exhaustive, critical analysis of each to determine whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning that any exact implementation derived solely from the snippet will pass **all** legitimate unit tests over the entire input domain without exception.

For each snippet, confirm that it meets **all** of the following rigorous requirements simultaneously:

1. **Exhaustive and explicit specification:**  
 - Every input, output, variable, constant, and data structure must be clearly and unambiguously defined with precise, implementable types or descriptions.  
 - All initializations, preconditions, invariants, and environment assumptions must be explicitly stated with no implicit or hidden dependencies.

2. **Deterministic, exact, and unambiguous logic:**  
 - All operations—including arithmetic, logical, control structures (branching, loops, recursion), and all calls—are fully specified with zero ambiguity or reliance on interpretation.  
 - No nondeterministic elements, hidden randomness, external/global state dependencies, or unspecified side effects are tolerable.

3. **Complete input domain coverage:**  
 - The snippet must explicitly or logically ensure correct, well-defined behavior for every possible valid input, including edge cases (empty, null, minimal/maximal, malformed inputs) and exceptional scenarios, with no undefined or erroneous state.

4. **Self-contained and context-independent:**  
 - The snippet stands alone as a complete specification for the algorithm and its behavior, requiring no external information, environment specifics, or implementation assumptions beyond what is included.

5. **Implementation feasibility and deterministic reproducibility:**  
 - A competent programmer can produce an exact, correct implementation from the snippet without guesswork, resulting in deterministic outputs identical on every run given the same inputs.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output a single digit:  
 - **1** if and only if the snippet meets all the above criteria completely and unconditionally.  
 - **0** if it fails any single criterion, including but not limited to ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumptions, nondeterminism, partial input coverage, or contextual dependencies.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their digits concatenated in the exact order the snippets are given, with no spaces, line breaks, explanations, or extra characters.

**Only output the resulting concatenated digits corresponding to the reproducibility verdicts, nothing else.**
