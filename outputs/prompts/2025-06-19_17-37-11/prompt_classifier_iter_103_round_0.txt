Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is fully **reproducible**—meaning it can be implemented exactly as-is to pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input with no ambiguity, no external dependencies, and fully deterministic, repeatable behavior.

Assess each snippet against these essential criteria:

1. **Explicit and Complete Definition:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, and initial setup detail is clearly and exhaustively specified. There are no implicit assumptions or missing constraints required for implementation or correctness.

2. **Precise, Unambiguous Control and Computation Flow:** The logic—including all control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion), calculations, and data manipulations—is described exactly and without vagueness or nondeterministic elements (e.g., randomness, undefined or environment-dependent behavior).

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage and Robustness:** The snippet’s behavior accounts for all permitted inputs, including edge cases and exceptional conditions, preventing errors such as infinite loops, crashes, or undefined results under any valid input scenario.

4. **Complete Self-Containment:** The pseudocode requires no external libraries, environment states, hidden variables, or contextual information beyond what is included. It is fully implementable without supplementation.

5. **Deterministic and Consistent Output:** For any fixed input, the snippet produces exactly the same output every time, ensuring repeatable unit test results without variation.

**Output Requirements:**  
- For each provided pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if it meets *all five* criteria fully, guaranteeing reproducibility and passing all unit tests on all valid inputs with zero ambiguity or external dependencies.  
  - `0` if it fails *any* criterion—if there is any ambiguity, missing detail, nondeterminism, incomplete input handling, or external reliance causing possible test failures or inconsistencies.  
- For multiple snippets, concatenate the outputs in the same order as the inputs, with no spaces, newlines, or additional characters.

**Produce only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to the input order, with absolutely no explanations, commentary, or extra text.**
