Analyze the given pseudocode snippet(s) thoroughly to determine if each is **fully reproducible** for all valid inputs—meaning it can be implemented exactly as written, without any ambiguity, incompleteness, or external dependencies, to deterministically pass *every* unit test under *any* valid input scenario.

To decide reproducibility, rigorously check these essential aspects:

1. **Explicit Completeness:** Every input, output, variable, constant, and data structure is clearly and fully specified. No implicit assumptions or missing constraints are required beyond what is stated or logically derivable from the snippet itself.

2. **Precise and Deterministic Logic:** The pseudocode is exact and unambiguous in describing every operation, control flow, and calculation. It forbids randomness, reliance on hidden state or side effects, nondeterministic behaviors, or any unspecified operations.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage:** It handles all possible valid inputs—including corner cases and exceptions—guaranteeing no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined behavior will occur. The algorithm’s correctness holds universally across all permissible inputs.

4. **Full Self-Containment:** The snippet stands alone without dependence on any external code, global/environmental state, third-party libraries, or contextual assumptions beyond what is provided explicitly. It is instantly implementable as-is.

5. **Consistent Output Guarantee:** For identical inputs, the snippet yields exactly the same outputs consistently, ensuring repeatable success on all unit tests and no variability or uncertainty in results.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each snippet, output a single character:  
  - `1` if the snippet perfectly meets **all five** rigorous criteria above, guaranteeing guaranteed unit test pass on all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if it fails **any** criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, hidden assumptions, nondeterminism, missing input cases, external dependencies, or any source of potential error or uncertainty.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their results concatenated in the input order, with no spaces, newlines, or additional characters.

**Output only the concatenated sequence of `1`s and `0`s — no explanations, comments, or extra text.**
