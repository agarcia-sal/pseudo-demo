Given one or more pseudocode snippets provided exactly between the delimiters below, analyze each snippet independently to determine whether it is **fully reproducible**, defined as follows:

A snippet is **fully reproducible** if and only if **every correct and faithful implementation derived solely from the snippet will always produce correct, deterministic, and fully defined outputs passing all valid unit tests on every possible input within the specified problem domain, without any exceptions.**

For each snippet, rigorously evaluate these comprehensive criteria **without exception** and **without assuming any external information**:

1. **Complete specification:** The snippet explicitly and unambiguously declares and fully specifies all inputs, outputs, internal variables, constants, data structures, initialization conditions, and any problem constraints or preconditions necessary to implement it correctly. No information required to implement or test is missing or implicit.

2. **Precise, deterministic, and unambiguous logic:** Every computational step, control flow construct (including loops, recursion, and conditionals), and procedure call is defined clearly and exactly, without any ambiguity, randomness, side effects, or external state dependencies that could alter behavior between implementations or runs.

3. **Exhaustive correctness coverage:** The snippet guarantees correct and well-defined behavior for **every** valid input, including edge cases, boundary inputs, corner cases, and degenerate scenarios. No input leads to undefined, partial, or incorrect behavior, nor to unspecified side effects.

4. **Self-contained and standalone:** The snippet contains all information needed to implement and execute it correctly and deterministically. No external assumptions, omitted functionality, or dependencies exist beyond what is explicitly defined within the snippet.

5. **Deterministic and consistent outputs:** For any fixed input, any faithful implementation of the snippet produces outputs that are identical and reproducible across all runs, locations, or environments, thereby passing **all conceivable valid unit tests** signaling correctness.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output exactly one digit:  
 - `1` if **all** the above reproducibility conditions are fully and strictly met.  
 - `0` if **any single condition is violated** or is uncertain, ambiguous, incomplete, or missing.  
- When multiple pseudocode snippets are supplied, output their digits in the exact order given, concatenated directly with no spaces, delimiters, new lines, or any extraneous characters.  
- Output nothing other than this concatenated string of digits. No explanations, no formatting, no whitespace characters or additional content.
