Given one or more pseudocode snippets provided below, **evaluate each snippet to determine with absolute certainty whether it is fully reproducible**—defined as being precisely specified, fully implementable, and guaranteed to pass all unit tests for every valid input without ambiguity, assumption, or external dependency.

Your assessment must be based on an exacting, holistic examination of the following dimensions:

1. **Explicit Completeness:** The snippet fully defines all necessary elements—inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, constraints, and assumptions—so no detail is missing, ambiguous, or implied outside the snippet itself.

2. **Precise and Deterministic Logic:** All operations, control flows (including conditionals, loops, and recursion), and data manipulations are unambiguous, deterministic, and free from nondeterminism such as randomness, concurrency, external state, side effects, or environment-dependent behavior.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage and Robustness:** The logic accounts for every possible valid input scenario including edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional states, ensuring the snippet can never produce runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined behavior.

4. **Complete Self-Containment:** The snippet is entirely self-sufficient; it has no dependencies on external code, libraries, global or external variables, configurations, or undocumented context. It must be implementable exactly as given.

5. **Deterministic, Consistent Output Across Runs:** For identical inputs, the snippet produces exactly the same outputs every time with no variation, ensuring reproducibility and consistent unit test success.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if it satisfies *all five* of these criteria perfectly, guaranteeing full reproducibility and universal unit test passability.  
  - `0` if it fails *any* of these criteria for any reason (ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing cases, external dependencies, inconsistent outputs, etc.).  
- For multiple snippets, concatenate their individual `1` or `0` outputs in the order given with no spaces, newlines, or other characters.  
- **Output only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s, nothing else—no explanations, summaries, or additional text.**
