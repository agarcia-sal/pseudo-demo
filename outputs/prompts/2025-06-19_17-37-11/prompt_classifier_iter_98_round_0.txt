Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each whether it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as given to produce correct, deterministic outputs that pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input, without ambiguity, omissions, or reliance on unstated assumptions or external factors.

To decide, rigorously verify that the pseudocode meets all **of the following**:

1. **Explicit Completeness:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, and configuration is clearly defined and unambiguous within the snippet. All necessary preconditions, input constraints, and parameter types are either explicitly stated or logically deducible solely from the pseudocode.

2. **Precise and Deterministic Flow:** All operations, control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion), data manipulations, and calculations are described with exactness and without vagueness. There are no random elements, hidden side effects, implicit globals, external state dependencies, or undefined behaviors.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage:** The pseudocode inherently handles every possible valid input scenario, including boundary conditions, corner cases, errors, and exceptions, precluding runtime failures, infinite loops, or undefined states on any legitimate input.

4. **Autonomy and Context Self-Sufficiency:** The snippet stands entirely on its own—requiring no external code, libraries, environmental assumptions, or context beyond what is fully provided. Its full logic and requirements are self-contained.

5. **Stable and Repeatable Output:** Given the same input, it deterministically produces identical outputs every time, ensuring guaranteed reproducibility and passing of any unit test relying on consistent behavior.

---

**Output format:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if it satisfies *all five* criteria fully, guaranteeing flawless, reproducible implementation across all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if it fails *any* criterion due to lack of clarity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, external dependencies, or any unpredictability.

- For multiple pseudocode snippets, output their binary results concatenated in input order with no spaces, newlines, or extra characters.

**Do not provide explanations, commentary, or anything beyond the exact concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s.**
