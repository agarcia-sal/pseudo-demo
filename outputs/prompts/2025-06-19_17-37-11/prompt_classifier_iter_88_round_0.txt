Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, determine for each snippet, with absolute certainty, whether it is fully reproducible: that is, whether it can be implemented exactly as written to produce correct, deterministic outputs that will pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input without exception, ambiguity, or assumption.

To decide, rigorously verify the following critical dimensions for each snippet:

1. **Explicit Completeness:** Every required element—inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initialization steps, and input constraints—is fully and unambiguously defined within the snippet. No implicit assumptions or omitted details are necessary.

2. **Precise, Deterministic Procedures:** The logic, including all operations, branching, loops, recursion, and calculations, is completely clear and free from vagueness, randomness, side effects, external dependencies, or undefined behaviors.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage:** All valid input cases, including edge conditions, boundary cases, error states, and exceptional scenarios, are handled so no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined results can occur.

4. **Standalone Self-Sufficiency:** The snippet is entirely self-contained; it requires no external context, global variables, undocumented preconditions, external libraries, or environment-related factors beyond what is explicitly given.

5. **Consistent Reproducibility:** Given the same input, the output is guaranteed to be exactly the same every time, ensuring repeatable unit test success with zero nondeterminism.

---

**Output Requirements:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output **exactly one character**:  
  - `1` if and only if *all five* dimensions above are met perfectly, guaranteeing faultless, reproducible correctness under all valid inputs.  
  - `0` if the snippet fails any single dimension, including any ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing input cases, external dependencies, or uncertain behavior.  
- When multiple snippets are presented, output their corresponding results as a single contiguous string in the same order, without spaces, line breaks, or any extra characters.

**IMPORTANT:** Output **only** the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to each snippet, nothing else—no explanations, no reasoning, no formatting.
