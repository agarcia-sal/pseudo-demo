Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, **determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be faithfully and exactly implemented to produce correct, consistent outputs that pass all unit tests on every valid input without exception**. Your judgment must rigorously verify all the following essential criteria for reproducibility:

1. **Absolute clarity and completeness:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, initial condition, and state is exhaustively and unambiguously specified within the snippet. There must be no placeholders, omissions, or implicit assumptions about inputs, environment, or preconditions. The valid input domain must be fully definable from the pseudocode itself or explicitly stated.

2. **Fully deterministic and unambiguous logic:** All control flows (conditions, loops, recursion), operations, data transformations, and calculations are precisely defined with no ambiguity or underspecified behavior. The snippet contains no randomness, concurrency effects, external dependencies, hidden side effects, or undefined operations that could affect correctness or consistency.

3. **Complete input domain and edge case handling:** The pseudocode logic must explicitly or implicitly cover every valid input scenario, including boundary and exceptional cases, such that no valid input can cause failures, errors, undefined behavior, or inconsistent outputs.

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:** The snippet must not rely on any external code, libraries, frameworks, global variables, runtime environment state, or assumptions outside its own text. It must be implementable exactly as given to achieve the intended behavior and pass all tests.

5. **Consistent and repeatable output:** For identical inputs, the snippet always produces the exact same outputs, guaranteeing deterministic unit test outcomes without variance.

**Instructions for output:**  
- For each provided pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if ALL the above criteria are met strictly, guaranteeing reproducibility and passage of all unit tests on all valid inputs;  
  - `0` if the snippet fails any of these criteria due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case coverage, implicit assumptions, external dependencies, or any source of uncertainty or error.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their results as a single concatenated string in their input order, without spaces, newlines, or any other characters.

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding exactly to the order of input snippets, and nothing else.**
