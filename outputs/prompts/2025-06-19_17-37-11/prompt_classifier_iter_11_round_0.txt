Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, rigorously evaluate each snippet to determine whether it is **unconditionally reproducible**—meaning that an exact implementation of the snippet will pass **all** valid unit tests for every possible input in its problem domain without fail.

For each snippet, verify that **all** of the following criteria are met **simultaneously**:

1. **Complete and explicit definitions:**  
 - Every input, output, variable, constant, and data structure is specified clearly with precise, implementable types or descriptions.  
 - Initializations, preconditions, and setup steps are fully stated, with no omitted assumptions or hidden dependencies.

2. **Deterministic, unambiguous operations:**  
 - Every instruction—including arithmetic, logic, control flow (conditionals, loops, recursion), and function calls—is fully detailed and leaves no room for multiple interpretations.  
 - No use of randomness, nondeterministic mechanisms, external state dependencies, or unspecified side effects.

3. **Comprehensive handling of inputs:**  
 - The snippet explicitly or logically guarantees correct behavior for all valid inputs, encompassing normal cases, edge cases (empty, null, minimal/maximal inputs), and exceptional conditions, without undefined or errant outcomes.

4. **Self-sufficiency and context independence:**  
 - The snippet stands alone: it contains all necessary information to ensure correctness and reproducibility, without relying on any unstated external knowledge, environment conditions, or implementation-specific details.

5. **Implementation-ready clarity and consistency:**  
 - Any competent programmer can implement the snippet exactly as written and consistently reproduce correct behavior on every run with identical inputs.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided, output a single digit:  
 - **1** if the snippet fully satisfies all above criteria, guaranteeing reproducibility.  
 - **0** if it fails any one or more criteria—for example, due to ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumptions, nondeterminism, or partial input coverage.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their corresponding digits **in snippet order**, concatenated with no spaces, line breaks, or additional characters.

**Do not include any explanations, reasoning, formatting, or characters other than the requested concatenated digits as the output.**
