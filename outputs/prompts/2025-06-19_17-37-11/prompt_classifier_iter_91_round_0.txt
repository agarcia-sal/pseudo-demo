Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet if it is fully reproducible—that is, it can be implemented exactly as given to produce correct, consistent outputs that will pass *all* unit tests for *every* valid input, without ambiguity, omissions, or assumptions.

For your evaluation, rigorously verify that each snippet meets *all* the following criteria perfectly:

1. **Explicit and Complete Definition:** The snippet explicitly defines all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial conditions without any missing or implicit information. Any necessary input constraints or assumptions are clearly provided or logically deducible solely from the snippet.

2. **Precise, Unambiguous, and Deterministic Logic:** All operations, control flows (including all branches, loops, and recursion), and calculations are described clearly and exactly, free from vagueness, randomness, side effects, or dependencies on external or hidden states. The behavior is fully deterministic.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage and Robustness:** The snippet robustly handles every possible valid input scenario, including edge cases, boundary values, and exceptional conditions. It guarantees no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined/unstated behaviors for any allowed input.

4. **Complete Self-Sufficiency:** The snippet is fully implementable using only the information within it; it does not rely on external libraries, global or environmental variables, or unstated contextual information.

5. **Output Consistency and Reproducibility:** For identical inputs, the snippet consistently produces exactly the same output every time, guaranteeing deterministic unit test results.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
 - `1` if and only if the snippet complies fully and exactly with *all five criteria* above, ensuring it is reproducible and will pass every unit test for all valid inputs.  
 - `0` otherwise, if it fails even one criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, insufficient input coverage, external dependencies, or any source of uncertainty or error.

- When multiple snippets are provided, output their respective results concatenated together in the exact order given, with no spaces, line breaks, or extra characters.

- Output strictly the sequence of `1`s and `0`s—no explanations, summaries, or additional text.
