Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **guaranteed reproducible**, defined as: any correct and faithful implementation of the snippet will deterministically produce fully correct outputs that pass **all valid unit tests on every possible input of its domain, without exception**.

For each snippet, **evaluate strictly and unconditionally all these criteria**:

1. **Complete definition:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, and state is exhaustively and explicitly specified with no omissions, ambiguities, or hidden assumptions.

2. **Deterministic and exact operations:** Every computational and control step (including loops, conditionals, recursion, and function calls) is described unambiguously, without randomness, external dependencies, side effects, concurrency issues, or reliance on mutable external state.

3. **Exhaustive correctness and input coverage:** The snippet guarantees well-defined, correct results for every valid input—explicitly accounting for all edge cases, bounds, invalid inputs (if relevant), and exceptional conditions—without producing undefined, partial, or incorrect outputs.

4. **Fully self-sufficient and implementable:** No external information, environment conditions, implicit knowledge, or unstated context is required; the snippet can be implemented exactly as given without supplemental details.

5. **Deterministic reproducibility:** Any faithful implementation will, for any given input, always produce the same correct output, ensuring the snippet’s behavior is fully repeatable and guaranteed to pass all valid unit tests by design.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each snippet, output one character only:  
 - `1` if and only if **all five criteria** above are completely met and reproducibility is fully guaranteed.  
 - `0` if **any single criterion** is not met, including implicit assumptions, ambiguity, incomplete coverage, nondeterminism, or any uncertainty.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their results concatenated in the exact order the snippets were given, with no delimiters, spaces, or extra characters.  
- **Produce strictly no explanation, formatting, whitespace, or any characters beyond the concatenated digits.**
