Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is strictly **reproducible**, meaning that any faithful implementation derived from the snippet will deterministically produce a correct output passing **all valid unit tests for every possible input** in its problem domain without exception.

For each snippet, decide if **all** of the following rigorous criteria hold **unconditionally**:

1. **Complete and unambiguous definition:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, precondition, and initialization is explicitly and exhaustively specified. No implicit assumptions, omitted details, or hidden dependencies exist.

2. **Fully deterministic and precisely described execution:** Each operation—arithmetic, logic, control structures (conditionals, loops, recursion), data manipulation, and function calls—is defined without ambiguity, nondeterminism, randomness, or reliance on undefined or mutable external state.

3. **Exhaustive correctness for entire input space:** The snippet guarantees correct, well-defined behavior for **every valid input**, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, exceptional or degenerate inputs; no input can produce incorrect, partial, undefined, or runtime-error results.

4. **Complete self-containment:** The snippet includes every detail required for an exact implementation with no dependence on external documentation, environmental assumptions, or contextual knowledge beyond what is presented.

5. **Deterministic reproducibility across implementations:** Any faithful implementation based on the snippet must produce consistent, identical, correct outputs on the same inputs, passing the entire suite of relevant unit tests without fail.

**Output instructions:**  
- Output exactly one character per pseudocode snippet in the order given:  
 - `1` if **all** above conditions hold rigorously and reproduceability is guaranteed.  
 - `0` if **any** condition is violated in any way (ambiguity, missing detail, nondeterminism, incomplete input handling, implicit assumptions, etc.).  
- When multiple snippets are provided, concatenate their outputs directly without spaces, newlines, or additional characters.  
- Output no explanations, comments, formatting, or extraneous content—only the final digit string.
