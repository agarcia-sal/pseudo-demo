Given the pseudocode below, perform a comprehensive, step-by-step verification to determine if it is absolutely complete, unambiguous, and executable as given, including all necessary variable initializations, definitions, control structures, data handling, and logical operations, such that it is guaranteed to produce the correct and consistent outputs for every valid input, thereby passing *all* unit tests flawlessly. Your evaluation must be strictly binary:

- Output **1** if the pseudocode is definitely fully specified and reproducible (it can be implemented directly without any assumptions or missing details and will succeed on all valid test cases).
- Output **0** if the pseudocode lacks sufficient detail, contains ambiguity, logical gaps, missing initialization, incomplete control flow, or any other deficiency preventing guaranteed correct execution on all valid inputs.

Provide **only a single digit** (1 or 0) as output for each pseudocode snippet, with no additional explanation, formatting, or commentary. When evaluating multiple pseudocodes sequentially, your outputs must appear in the exact input order, one digit per pseudocode.
