Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether it is **fully reproducible**, defined as: any faithful implementation of the snippet will produce a **correct, deterministic, and consistent solution passing all valid unit tests on every possible valid input** within the problem domain, without exception.

For each snippet, rigorously confirm all of the following **hold absolutely and unconditionally**:

1. **Explicit completeness:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and preconditions are completely and unambiguously specified. No missing information, implicit assumptions, or external dependencies exist.

2. **Deterministic, unambiguous logic:** Every operation—including control flow (branches, loops, recursion), computations, and calls—is described in a precise, unambiguous way that excludes nondeterminism, randomness, side effects, external or mutable state dependencies.

3. **Total correctness over entire input domain:** The snippet explicitly or implicitly guarantees correct, well-defined behavior and outputs for **all valid inputs**, including edge cases and exceptional conditions; it cannot produce partial, undefined, or invalid results.

4. **Fully self-contained and implementable as-is:** The snippet requires no external information, environment assumptions, or supplemental context beyond what is given. It is directly implementable without guessing or adding details.

5. **Reliable reproducibility:** Running any faithful implementation of the snippet on the same input always yields the same correct output, ensuring it passes every valid unit test for its problem.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
 - `1` if the snippet meets all above criteria and reproducibility is guaranteed.  
 - `0` if it violates any condition including ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing cases, or hidden assumptions.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output their corresponding digits concatenated **in the same order given, with no spaces, line breaks, or extra characters**.

**Strictly output only the concatenated string of digits—no explanations, formatting, or any other content.**
