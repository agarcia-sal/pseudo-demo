Evaluate each pseudocode snippet provided below to determine whether it is fully reproducible—meaning it can be unambiguously and exactly implemented as given, producing deterministic, correct outputs that pass every unit test for all valid inputs without any additional assumptions, clarifications, or external information.

Your evaluation must rigorously verify that each snippet meets **all** of the following mandatory criteria:

1. **Explicit Completeness:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, and initial states are clearly and exhaustively defined within the snippet. Any necessary input constraints or assumptions must be explicitly stated or directly and logically inferable from the pseudocode itself, with no reliance on external knowledge.

2. **Precise, Deterministic Logic:** Every step—including arithmetic, control flow, data manipulation, and recursion—is described completely and unambiguously. There must be no vague descriptions, implicit operations, nondeterministic elements (e.g., randomness, concurrency), external state dependencies, or undefined behaviors.

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage:** The pseudocode reliably handles all valid inputs, including boundary and edge cases, without omission—ensuring no runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined states can occur under any permissible input.

4. **Self-Sufficient Context:** The snippet is entirely self-contained, with no dependencies on external libraries, global variables, configurations, or environmental states unless explicitly included. All necessary information to implement and execute the pseudocode correctly is contained within the snippet.

5. **Consistent, Repeatable Outputs:** Running the snippet with the same valid inputs always yields identical outputs, guaranteeing reproducibility and unit test consistency with zero variability or randomness.

**Output Instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output a single digit:  
  - `1` if and only if **all five** criteria are rigorously satisfied, guaranteeing the snippet is precisely reproducible and passes all unit tests for every valid input.  
  - `0` if the snippet fails **any** criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing input coverage, reliance on external context, or inconsistent results.

- When multiple snippets are provided, output a concatenated string of their results in exact input order—no spaces, line breaks, or additional characters.

**Important:** Output exactly and only the sequence of `1`s and `0`s. Do not include explanations, comments, or any other text.
