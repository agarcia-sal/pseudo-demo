Given one or more pseudocode snippets enclosed below, your task is to determine for each snippet whether it is fully reproducible—meaning it can be implemented exactly as given to reliably produce correct, consistent outputs that pass **all** unit tests for **every** valid input without any failure or ambiguity.

To make this determination, rigorously evaluate each snippet against these essential, non-negotiable criteria:

1. **Complete clarity and explicitness:** All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initial states, and assumptions are explicitly and unambiguously defined. There are no missing definitions, no implicit context or external assumptions, and valid input domains are either clearly stated or fully inferable from the pseudocode itself.

2. **Unambiguous, deterministic logic:** Every operation—including control flow, calculations, data modifications, and recursion—is precisely and exhaustively described without vague or multiple interpretations. The snippet contains no randomness, nondeterminism, side effects, dependence on hidden global or external state, or undefined behavior.

3. **Comprehensive input handling:** All valid input cases—including edge cases, boundary values, and exceptional inputs—are correctly accounted for. The pseudocode handles every scenario without errors, omissions, or undefined outcomes.

4. **Self-contained and environment-independent:** The snippet requires no external libraries, frameworks, environment-specific features, or global variables beyond what is fully included or specified in the pseudocode.

5. **Consistent reproducibility:** The snippet produces exactly the same output every time for the same input, ensuring deterministic behavior that guarantees the passing of all unit tests.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if **and only if** the snippet satisfies **all five criteria fully and without exception.**  
  - `0` if it fails **any** criterion due to ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge case handling, implicit or external dependencies, or any other source of uncertainty or potential error.  
- If multiple snippets are provided, output their results as a single concatenated string in the order given, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other characters.

Your final response must contain **only** this concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s, strictly corresponding to the input snippets and nothing else.
