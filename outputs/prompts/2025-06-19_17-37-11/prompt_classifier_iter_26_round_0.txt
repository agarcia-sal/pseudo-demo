Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, determine for each snippet whether its implementation is **fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all valid unit tests on every possible valid input** within its problem domain, under any correct faithful interpretation.

For each snippet, output **1** if and only if **all** of the following strict criteria are met; otherwise output **0**:

1. **Complete Specification:** The snippet explicitly defines all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, constants, initialization values, preconditions, and any relevant constraints. There are no implicit assumptions or missing details that affect correctness or completeness.

2. **Deterministic and Unambiguous Description:** Every step—calculations, decisions, control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals), and function calls—is described clearly, precisely, and unambiguously, allowing exactly one interpretation. The snippet does not rely on randomness, unspecified behavior, external mutable state, timing-dependent features, or side-effects beyond stated elements.

3. **Total and Correct Input Domain Handling:** The snippet guarantees well-defined, correct behavior on **all** valid inputs within the full problem domain, including normal cases, edge cases, boundary values, empty or minimal inputs, and exceptional but valid inputs. No input can cause incorrect output, runtime error, undefined behavior, infinite loops, or incomplete processing.

4. **Fully Self-Contained and Independent:** The snippet can be implemented exactly as written, without requiring any external context, environment assumptions, or hidden knowledge not provided within or explicitly stated.

5. **Reproducibility of Output:** For every fixed valid input, repeated executions of the implemented snippet produce the same **correct** output deterministically, guaranteed to pass **all** corresponding unit tests that validate correctness within the specified domain.

---

**Output format:**  
- For each snippet, output a single digit:  
 - **1** if the snippet meets all criteria above and is reproducible as defined.  
 - **0** otherwise.  
- When multiple snippets are given, output their digits concatenated exactly in the input order, with no spaces, newlines, or any other characters.

**Do not output explanations, reasoning, or any characters other than the concatenated digits.**
