Given one or more pseudocode snippets below, evaluate each independently and determine if it is fully reproducible—i.e., it can be implemented exactly as given and will pass all unit tests for every valid input without fail. Reproducibility means the pseudocode is unambiguous, complete, deterministic, and robust enough to guarantee correct, consistent outputs under all valid conditions.

To decide this for each snippet, rigorously verify all of the following without exception:

1. **Completeness and explicitness:** Every input, output, variable, data structure, constant, initial state, and precondition is clearly and explicitly defined within the snippet or trivially inferred without external assumptions. The valid input domain is fully covered or clearly indicated.

2. **Deterministic and precise semantics:** All operations—including control flow, data manipulation, and calculations—are described unambiguously, with no hidden side effects, randomization, dependence on external or mutable environment, or undefined behavior. For each step, the outcome is fully determined by the inputs and internal state.

3. **Exhaustive correctness and edge case handling:** The snippet’s logic correctly addresses all normal, boundary, and exceptional cases within the input domain, preventing runtime errors, infinite loops, or undefined outcomes for any valid input.

4. **Self-contained and environment independent:** The snippet can be reproduced exactly as-is, without dependencies on external frameworks, libraries, global variables, or contextual/environmental state not included in the pseudocode.

5. **Consistent repeatability of results:** For the same inputs, the snippet produces identical outputs on every execution, guaranteeing deterministic behavior essential for passing all unit tests reliably.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode snippet in the order given, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if and only if the snippet satisfies *all* the above criteria fully and guarantees passing all unit tests for every valid input.  
  - `0` if *any* criterion is violated — such as ambiguity, incompleteness, nondeterminism, missing edge cases, implicit dependencies, or uncertain behavior.  
- When multiple snippets are provided, output the results as a single concatenated string in input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any extraneous characters.

**Respond only with the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s exactly matching the number and order of the input snippets, and nothing else.**
