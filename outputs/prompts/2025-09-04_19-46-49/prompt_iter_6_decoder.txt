Translate the provided pseudocode into clear, well-structured, and idiomatic Python code that precisely implements the described logic, including all implicitly suggested details and edge cases. Preserve the original function names as specified in the pseudocode. Your solution should emphasize readability, correctness, and efficiency, optimizing to run well within a 5-second limit.

Use descriptive docstrings and type hints where appropriate to clarify the functionâ€™s behavior, inputs, and outputs. You may leverage any relevant and widely available Python standard library or third-party packages to produce clean, maintainable, and performant code.

Enclose all your code within a single Python code block formatted as follows:

```python
# Your complete translated Python code here
```

Do not include any separator lines or extraneous comments outside the code block.
