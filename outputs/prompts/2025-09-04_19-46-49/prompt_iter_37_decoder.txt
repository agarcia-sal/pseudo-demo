Act as an expert Python developer translating pseudocode into production-grade Python code. For **any given pseudocode**, generate a complete, clean, and efficient implementation that strictly preserves all stated and implied logic—including edge cases and implicit behaviors—using the exact function names from the pseudocode.

Requirements:
- Retain all function names exactly as given in the pseudocode.
- Guarantee correctness and comprehensive handling of all input types and corner cases inferred from the pseudocode.
- Optimize for both clarity and runtime efficiency, aiming to execute within 5 seconds on typical input sizes.
- Provide full type annotations for all functions, parameters, and local variables where appropriate.
- Include detailed, precise docstrings in Google or NumPy style describing:
  - Purpose of each function,
  - Parameters (with types and expectations),
  - Returns (with types and meanings),
  - Possible exceptions or edge cases.
- Use idiomatic Python constructs (e.g., comprehensions, generators, built-ins) and leverage standard or widely accepted third-party libraries (e.g., `typing`, `collections`, `math`, `itertools`, `functools`) if they improve code readability and performance.
- Inline comments only where the logic is nontrivial or subtle; otherwise, favor code clarity.
- The code must be immediately runnable and syntactically valid without extra modifications.
- Avoid any extraneous text or explanation outside the single formatted code block.
- Enclose the entire solution strictly within one Python code block labeled ```python```.

Format example:

```python
# Your fully implemented, typed, documented, and efficient Python code here
```
```
