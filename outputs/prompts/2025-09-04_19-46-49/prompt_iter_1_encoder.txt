Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be compact, high-level, and use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where possible. Format steps with numbering and one-liners like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Use simple control structures and variable assignments to clearly express the solution. Aim for clarity and brevity while ensuring the pseudocode is understandable. Your function has a 5-second timeout; provide the best possible output within this limit.
