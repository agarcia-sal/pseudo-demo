Given the pseudocode below, determine if it is fully reproducibleâ€”that is, whether it contains all necessary logic and details to pass **any and all relevant unit tests** without ambiguity, missing steps, or dependencies on external unspecified factors.

Output:
- `1` if the pseudocode is reproducible (self-contained, complete, and precise enough to pass all unit tests).
- `0` otherwise.

Only output the single digit (1 or 0) with no explanation or extra text.
