Given the pseudocode below, evaluate **comprehensively and rigorously** whether it is fully reproducible â€” that is, it must be sufficiently detailed, unambiguous, and fully self-contained such that it can reliably pass **every relevant unit test** without reliance on unstated assumptions, external data, or missing logic.

Specifically, check for:

- Complete algorithmic logic and all necessary computational steps explicitly stated  
- Clear and precise definitions of input, output, and intermediate operations  
- No ambiguity or vagueness in procedural instructions or control flow  
- Absence of dependencies on external or unspecified entities  
- Handling of edge cases and error conditions implied or explicit  
- Consistency and determinism of the procedure given the same inputs  

After processing the given pseudocode, output **only one digit per input:**  
- `1` if the pseudocode meets the above criteria and can pass all unit tests reliably  
- `0` if it is incomplete, ambiguous, or otherwise non-reproducible  

Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) per pseudocode input, in the order inputs are given, with no additional text, formatting, or explanations.
