Translate the following pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that executes correctly within 5 seconds on typical competitive programming inputs. Your code must read input exclusively using `input()` with no prompt strings and must handle all I/O as shown or implied by the pseudocode. 

Wrap your entire solution in a single Python code block denoted by triple backticks and `python` (```python ... ```). Avoid any explanations, comments, or extra text outside the code block. Prioritize correctness, readability, optimal performance, and concise logic. You may use any standard Python libraries but ensure they are imported explicitly within your code. Focus on producing production-quality code that individually solves the problem described by the pseudocode provided, handling edge cases and large inputs efficiently.
