Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and high-performance Python code. Your code must handle standard input/output using plain `input()` calls without prompt strings and produce the correct output exactly as specified. Enclose the entire code in a single Python code block labeled with ```python. Prioritize clarity, correctness, and efficiency, leveraging Python's standard library and built-in functions where appropriate. Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or separatorsâ€”provide only the fully functional Python code within the code block. Your implementation should be optimized to run within a 5-second time limit on typical competitive programming inputs.
