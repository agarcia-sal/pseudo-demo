Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that runs within a 5-second timeout.  
- Enclose the entire solution in a single, properly formatted Python code block using triple backticks with `python`.  
- Your code must read input using plain `input()` calls (no prompts) and print outputs exactly as required.  
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and performance; avoid unnecessary computations or memory overhead.  
- Use built-in Python libraries and data structures where appropriate to maximize efficiency and simplicity.  
- Do NOT include explanations, comments, or any text other than the complete Python code.  
- Ensure that the generated code is standalone and ready to run without any external dependencies beyond the Python standard library.
