Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that runs correctly within a 5-second execution limit.  
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block using triple backticks with `python` (```python ... ```).  
- Use standard input via `input()` without prompts or extra arguments, and output results using `print()` as needed.  
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and performance, including use of appropriate data structures, built-in functions, algorithms, and libraries where relevant.  
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity: do not include explanations, comments, or debugging output.  
- Your solution should be standalone and fully executable, including any needed function or class definitions and entry-point guards (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) when appropriate.
