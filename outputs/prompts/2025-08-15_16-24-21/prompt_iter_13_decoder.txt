Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-optimized Python code that runs within 5 seconds.  
- Enclose your entire code within a single Python code block using triple backticks and the language identifier: ```python ... ```  
- Your code should read inputs using plain `input()` calls without prompt strings.  
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and performance, employing Python standard libraries or built-in functions as needed to maximize efficiency.  
- Do not include any explanation, comments, or extra textâ€”only the complete Python code.  
- Handle all necessary imports within the code block.  
- Assume the code should be ready to run as-is (e.g., include `if __name__ == "__main__":` guards if appropriate).
