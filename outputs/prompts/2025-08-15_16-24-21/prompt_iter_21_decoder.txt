Translate the following pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python code optimized for readability and performance under a 5-second execution time constraint. Your solution must:

- Use only standard Python libraries unless absolutely necessary for optimization.
- Handle input exclusively with plain `input()` calls, without prompts or explanatory strings.
- Include necessary functions and a clear entry point (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) when appropriate.
- Guard against common edge cases and ensure correctness.
- Leverage Pythonic constructs and best practices for clarity and speed.
- Enclose the entire solution strictly within a single triple-backtick Python code block:
  
  ```python
  # your optimized code here
  ```

Do not add any explanations, comments, or output beyond the exact code solving the problem as described by the pseudocode.
