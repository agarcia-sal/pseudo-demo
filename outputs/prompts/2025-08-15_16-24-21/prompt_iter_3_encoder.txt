Generate compact, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description that is clear and easy to read. Use a natural language style mixed with concise symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Prefer one-line statements where possible without sacrificing clarity. Number each step sequentially starting at 1, following this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Express variables, assignments, loops, conditions, data structures, and operations straightforwardly and succinctly. Use minimal keywords, no comments, no explanations or summaries, and no extra formatting or separators. Write the pseudocode so it stands alone and is immediately understandable. Use phrases like:

- read variable  
- let variable be [type]  
- for i in [range]:  
- if condition then action  
- set variable ← value  
- print variable  

Involve natural wording but keep it brief and consistent.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j in i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
