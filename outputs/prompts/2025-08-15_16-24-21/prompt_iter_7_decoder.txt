Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python code, strictly enclosed within a single Python code block marked by triple backticks (```python ... ```). Your solution must:

- Use minimal yet clear code with optimal time and space complexity.
- Handle input strictly via `input()` without prompts or extra text.
- Avoid unnecessary print statements or explanations; print only the final required output(s).
- Include necessary imports if external libraries significantly improve clarity or performance.
- Follow Python best practices, including function encapsulation and concise logic.
- Guarantee code runs correctly under a 5-second timeout for typical competitive programming constraints.

Provide only the fully working Python codeâ€”no explanations, comments, or extra formatting beyond the required code block.
