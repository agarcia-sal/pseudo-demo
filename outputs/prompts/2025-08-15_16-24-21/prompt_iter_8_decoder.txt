Translate the given pseudocode into clear, concise, and efficient Python code focusing on correctness and optimal runtime within a 5-second limit. Your code must be ready to run as-is, reading all required inputs using plain `input()` calls without prompts. Include any necessary imports at the top, and do not add explanatory comments or print anything beyond what the problem requires. Output only the complete solution enclosed in a single Python code block marked with triple backticks and `python` (i.e., ```python ... ```). Avoid unnecessary separators or additional text. Use any Python standard library modules as needed to maximize performance and clarity.
