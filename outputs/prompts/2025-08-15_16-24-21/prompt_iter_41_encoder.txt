Generate concise, clear pseudocode for the given problem description emphasizing readability through natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Use a compact, high-level style, preferably one statement per line with minimal keywords while preserving clarity. Number each step sequentially, like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Express variables, loops, conditions, assignments, function definitions, and data structures naturally and succinctly without comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting. Use consistent, clear style with simple, direct statements that stand alone and require no extra context.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
