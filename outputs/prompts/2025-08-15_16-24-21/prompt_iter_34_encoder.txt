Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description using mostly natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Write in a compact, high-level style, preferring single-line statements where clarity is preserved. Number steps sequentially starting at 1, using this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Express variables, assignments, loops, conditions, functions, and data structures succinctly and naturally, avoiding verbose keywords. Use minimal punctuation; no comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting (no separator lines). The pseudocode should stand alone for understanding, emphasizing brevity without sacrificing clarity.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
