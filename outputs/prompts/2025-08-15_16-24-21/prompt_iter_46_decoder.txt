Translate the given pseudocode into efficient, clear, and correct Python code that runs within 5 seconds. Your code must:

- Be fully contained within a single Python code block marked by triple backticks ```python ... ```.
- Use only input() for reading inputs without any prompts.
- Print outputs exactly as specified in the pseudocode.
- Avoid any extra explanation, comments, or separators.
- Optimize for clarity and performance; you may use any standard Python library.
- Structure your code sensibly (functions, main guard, etc.) if appropriate.
