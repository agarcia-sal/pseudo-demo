Translate the pseudocode below into clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python code that runs within 5 seconds for all reasonable inputs. Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block formatted as ```python ... ```. Your code must read inputs exactly as shown in the pseudocode using plain input() calls (no prompt strings). Prioritize clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiency. You may import and use any standard Python library or module to optimize performance. Do not include explanations, comments, or extraneous outputâ€”only the final executable Python code.
