Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and performance-optimized Python code. Your entire solution must be wrapped within a single Python code block marked with triple backticks and `python` (```python ... ```).  
- Use standard input/output methods without any prompt strings (e.g., `input()` only).  
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and efficiency to ensure execution within 5 seconds.  
- Incorporate Python best practices, including appropriate data structures and, where beneficial, standard libraries or built-in modules.  
- Avoid unnecessary comments or explanations; output only the final Python code.
