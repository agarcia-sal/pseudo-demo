Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and efficient Python 3 code that runs correctly within 5 seconds. Use only built-in Python standard libraries or modules that come pre-installed with Python. Your code must read inputs using plain `input()` calls without prompts, handle all processing, and produce outputs exactly as specified, without any extra text or comments. Always enclose the full solution in a single, properly formatted Python code block delineated by triple backticks and `python`. Prioritize readability, correctness, and performance. Do not output anything other than the final Python code block.
