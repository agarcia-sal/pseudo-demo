Translate the given pseudocode into clear, correct, and efficient Python code that executes within 5 seconds. Your entire solution must be enclosed in a single Python code block using triple backticks (```python ... ```). Use unprompted `input()` calls exactly as needed for input reading. Avoid printing anything other than the required output. Prioritize clean, well-structured code that handles edge cases and optimizes performance. You may freely use any built-in or standard Python libraries but do not import external packages beyond the standard library. Do not include any explanations, comments, or extra textâ€”only the Python code block.
