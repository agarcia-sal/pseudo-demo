Generate concise, clear pseudocode from the given problem description using mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Use a compact, high-level style that favors single-line statements without sacrificing clarity. Sequentially number each step starting at 1, following this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Express variables, loops, conditions, assignments, and common data structures naturally but succinctly. Use phrases like “let x be integer”, “read n”, “for i in 0 to n-1”, “if condition then action”, and terse arithmetic or logical expressions. Avoid verbose wording, explanatory text, comments, summaries, or formatting such as separators. The pseudocode should stand alone and be easy to read, prioritizing brevity and consistent style.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
