Translate the provided pseudocode into clear, correct, and highly efficient Python code that completes execution within 5 seconds.  
- Ensure all code is enclosed in a single Python code block marked with triple backticks and `python` (```python ... ```).  
- Use standard input/output via calls to `input()` and `print()` only, with no input prompts or extra output.  
- Prioritize optimal algorithmic efficiency, readability, and Pythonic best practices.  
- Utilize any built-in Python libraries or modules as needed to maximize performance and clarity.  
- Omit comments and explanatory text; output only the valid executable Python code.
