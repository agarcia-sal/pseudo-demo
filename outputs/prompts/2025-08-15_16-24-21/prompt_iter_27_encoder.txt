Generate concise, clear pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to make instructions compact and high-level while preserving readability. Express variables, conditions, loops, assignments, and data structures naturally with minimal keywords. Favor one-liner statements where possible, numbered sequentially starting at 1:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or any extra formatting (no separators or headings). Use consistent, brief style emphasizing clarity through brevity. The output should be self-explanatory and easy to understand without additional context.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
