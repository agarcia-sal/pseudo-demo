Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python code, suitable for execution within a 5-second time limit. Your solution must:

- Use only standard Python libraries or built-in functions—import if necessary to improve clarity or performance.
- Handle input strictly via `input()` calls without arguments or prompts.
- Be fully enclosed within a single Python code block marked as ```python ... ```.
- Follow best practices for Pythonic style, readability, and correctness.
- Avoid any extraneous text or explanation—output only the Python code.

Focus on optimizing algorithmic efficiency, minimizing unnecessary computations, and producing robust, maintainable code that directly corresponds to the pseudocode logic.
