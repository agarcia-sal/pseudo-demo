Generate clear and concise pseudocode for the provided problem description, using natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Write the pseudocode in a compact, high-level style, favoring single-line statements whenever possible while preserving readability. Number each step sequentially as follows:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use minimal keywords, no explanations, no comments, no summaries, and no extra formatting (no separator lines). Represent variables, loops, conditions, assignments, and data structures naturally but succinctly. The pseudocode should be understandable on its own, easy to read, and emphasize clarity through brevity and consistent style.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers of size n  
read elements into A  
for i in 0 to n-1:  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j in i+1 to n-1: if A[min_i] > A[j] then min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
