Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and performance-optimized Python code. Your complete solution must be enclosed in a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# your code here
```

Requirements:
- Use only standard or built-in Python libraries; you may import any such modules if they enhance clarity or efficiency.
- Read inputs exactly as described using plain input() calls without any prompts or arguments.
- Ensure your implementation terminates within 5 seconds for typical competitive programming constraints.
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and algorithmic efficiency.
- Avoid extraneous output, comments, or explanationsâ€”output only the working Python code.
- Structure your code with functions and a clear entry point (e.g., `if __name__ == "__main__":`) when appropriate.

Focus on transforming pseudocode into robust, idiomatic Python that is ready for immediate use and easy to understand.
