Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic and abbreviated expressions. Do not include purpose, summary, overview, notes, or comments—only the pseudocode itself. Structure pseudocode in a compact, high-level style, preferring one-liners where possible. Number each step as in:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure it is clear and understandable without extra explanation. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for best results within this limit.
