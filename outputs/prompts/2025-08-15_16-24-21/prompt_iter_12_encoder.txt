Generate compact, clear, and readable pseudocode for the given problem description using a blend of natural language and symbolic notation. Use concise high-level statements, preferably one-liners, with minimal keywords and common abbreviations. Number each step sequentially like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Express variables, loops, conditions, assignments, and data structures naturally but succinctly. Avoid explanations, summaries, comments, or any extra formatting or separators. Use natural phrasing but keep it brief and consistent.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
