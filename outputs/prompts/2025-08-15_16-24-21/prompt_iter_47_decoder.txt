Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code that reads input from standard input using plain `input()` calls without prompts. Your complete solution should be wrapped **exclusively** in a single Python code block marked by triple backticks with `python` (```python ... ```). Focus on correctness, readability, and time/memory efficiency to guarantee execution within a 5-second time limit. You may use any standard Python libraries if needed, but do not import unnecessary packages. Do **not** include any explanations, comments, or output beyond the requested code. Avoid prompt messages or input argument stringsâ€”use bare `input()`. Your output should be only the Python code enclosed in the code block.
