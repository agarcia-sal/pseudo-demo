Translate the given pseudocode into clear, concise, and efficient Python code that runs within 5 seconds. Your implementation must:

- Use standard input via plain calls to `input()` with no prompt strings.
- Handle all input/output exactly as described, with no extra prints or explanations.
- Include all necessary imports explicitly at the top.
- Focus on code readability, correctness, and performance optimizations appropriate for general algorithmic problems.
- Enclose your entire solution in a single properly formatted Python code block marked by triple backticks and `python`.

Do not add any commentary or text besides the code block.
