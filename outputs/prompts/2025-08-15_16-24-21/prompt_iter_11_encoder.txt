Generate concise, clear pseudocode from the given problem description using natural language augmented with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Write in a compact, high-level style that favors single-line statements whenever possible while maintaining readability. Number each step sequentially as shown:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Express variables, assignments, loops, conditions, and data structures naturally but succinctly. Use minimal keywords and no explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting. Avoid separator lines. Emphasize clarity through brevity, consistent style, and straightforward logic so the pseudocode stands alone and is easy to understand.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
