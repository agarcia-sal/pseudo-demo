Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and optimized Python code that runs correctly within 5 seconds.  
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block marked with triple backticks and `python` (```python ... ```).  
- Implement all necessary input and output using plain `input()` and `print()` functions without any prompts or explanatory text.  
- Write self-contained code that includes all needed imports and helper functions.  
- Prioritize efficient algorithms, clear structure, and proper use of built-in Python features or standard libraries to maximize performance.  
- Avoid unnecessary variables, loops, or redundant computations while preserving clarity and correctness.  
- Do not include comments, explanations, or any text outside the code block.
