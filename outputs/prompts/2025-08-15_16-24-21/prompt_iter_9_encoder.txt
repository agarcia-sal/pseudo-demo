Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language combined with minimal symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Favor one-line statements that preserve clarity and logical flow. Number each step sequentially:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Represent variables, loops, conditions, assignments, function declarations, and data structures naturally but succinctly. Use minimal keywords, avoid explanations, summaries, comments, or extra formatting such as separators. The output should be only the pseudocode, fully understandable on its own by a reader familiar with standard programming concepts.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i in 0 to n-1:  
 set min_i to i  
 for j in i+1 to n-1: if A[min_i] > A[j] then min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
