Generate concise, clear pseudocode strictly from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language with minimal, standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Write in a high-level, compact style favoring single-line statements whenever possible without sacrificing readability. Number each step in order, starting from 1, formatted as:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Represent variables, loops, conditions, assignments, functions, and data structures naturally and succinctly. Use simple keywords (let, read, set, if, for, while, print, return) without punctuation beyond minimal needed symbols (←, =, <, >, %, :, parentheses). Avoid comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting like separator lines. Do not include purpose or overview statements. The pseudocode should stand alone, be easy to follow, and consistently styled.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i in 0 to n-1:  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j in i+1 to n-1: if A[min_i] > A[j] then set min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
