Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that executes correctly within 5 seconds.  
- Enclose the entire solution inside a single Python code block marked by triple backticks and the word `python` (```python ... ```).  
- Read all inputs strictly using `input()` without any prompt strings.  
- Do not include any extra explanations, comments, or output other than what the pseudocode specifies.  
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and optimal performance; use built-in functions and standard libraries as needed to improve efficiency.  
- Use functions or classes for modularity when appropriate, but keep the code concise and focused on the problem.  
- Avoid redundant or unnecessary computations and data structures to minimize runtime and memory usage.  
- Do not print any debugging information or separators.  
- Assume standard input/output only, and do not import non-standard libraries.  
  
Produce only the final Python code, ready to be run as-is.
