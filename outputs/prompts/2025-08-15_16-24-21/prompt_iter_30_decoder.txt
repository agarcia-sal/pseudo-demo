Translate the following pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and optimized Python code that runs correctly and efficiently within a 5-second time limit. Provide the complete code including any necessary imports and function definitions, and strictly adhere to the following requirements:

- Enclose the entire code in a single Python code block marked by triple backticks (```python ... ```).
- Use plain `input()` calls without any prompt strings.
- Prioritize clear, idiomatic Python that balances readability, correctness, and performance.
- Avoid adding explanations, comments, or any text outside the code block.
- Use standard or widely available Python libraries if they improve clarity or efficiency.
- Structure your code naturally and logically, using functions or classes as appropriate to the original pseudocode.
- Handle edge cases implicitly, just as the pseudocode suggests.
- Do not include extraneous print statements or debug outputs; print only the final intended output(s).

Your goal is to produce a robust solution that can be directly run to solve the described pseudocode task with maximum accuracy and speed.
