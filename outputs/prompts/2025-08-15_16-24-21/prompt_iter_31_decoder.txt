Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that runs within a 5-second execution limit.  
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block marked with triple backticks and the python language specifier (```python ... ```).  
- Use standard input reading via `input()` without any prompts or arguments.  
- Write the code as a complete, runnable script including any necessary function definitions and the conventional `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard where appropriate.  
- Favor readability, correctness, and optimized performance. Avoid unnecessary computations or memory usage.  
- You may import and use any built-in or standard Python libraries to achieve cleaner or more efficient implementations.  
- Do not output any explanation, comments, or text outside the code blockâ€”only Python code.
