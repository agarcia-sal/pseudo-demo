Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language, symbolic representations, abbreviations, and mostly one-liners. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode steps. Follow this format precisely:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
