Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that preserves all control flow, variable assignments, function calls, and loops uniformly and simply.  
Use mostly natural language with compact symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep the pseudocode high-level, readable, and brief. Favor one-liners where possible, using indentation only for nested blocks.  
Express input/output plainly (e.g., “read x”, “print y”). Declare variables only if it aids clarity (e.g., “let x be integer”).  
Loops and conditionals should be terse and natural (e.g., “for i ← 0 to n-1”, “if x > y then”).  
Omit less critical details or complex expressions if it reduces verbosity without losing core logic or control flow.  
Output only the pseudocode lines, numbered from 1, with no empty or separator lines and no explanations or comments. Use a single consistent style throughout.  

Example format:  
1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. for i ← 0 to n - 1  
6. &emsp;read A[i]  
7. for i ← 0 to n - 1  
8. &emsp;set min_i ← i  
9. &emsp;for j ← i + 1 to n - 1  
10. &emsp;&emsp;if A[j] < A[min_i] then set min_i ← j  
11. &emsp;swap A[i], A[min_i]  
12. print A
