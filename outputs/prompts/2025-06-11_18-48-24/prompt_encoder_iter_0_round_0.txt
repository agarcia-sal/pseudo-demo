Translate the given code into concise, easy-to-read pseudocode using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Use a compact, high-level style that prefers one-liners and omits detailed info if it helps reduce length. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, or notes for clarity—only the pseudocode itself. Format each step as numbered lines, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode following this style. Your function has a 10-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
