Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be compact, high-level, and use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate. Write pseudocode only—do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations. Prefer one-liners and simple loops or conditionals formatted as:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure clarity and readability while keeping the code minimal. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
