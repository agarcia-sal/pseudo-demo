Convert the provided code into concise, abstract pseudocode that preserves all original function and class names along with their exact hierarchical structure. Represent all control flow and operations using full descriptive keywords (such as FUNCTION, RETURN, IF, ELSE IF, ELSE, FOR, WHILE, SET, INCREMENT, DECREMENT, APPEND, CONCATENATE) without symbols or abbreviations. Use clean and consistent indentation to clearly delineate code blocks. Express expressions naturally but succinctly—avoid excessive verbosity while maintaining clarity and precision. Do not include any comments, explanations, or notes—output only the pseudocode reflecting the code’s logic and structure exactly, enabling a direct unambiguous translation back to runnable code. Use meaningful generic terms (e.g., list_of_items, index) only when original variable names are unclear or unavailable. Do not add sections, headings, or separators; produce the pseudocode directly and exclusively.
