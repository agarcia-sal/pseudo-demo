Translate the provided pseudocode into fully functional Python code with exact preservation of all function and class names, including their parameter names and return types. Maintain all class and object structures as described without alteration. Your implementation must be clean, idiomatic, and optimized for correctness and performance—leveraging any suitable standard Python libraries or modules to ensure robustness and efficiency. 

Automatically infer and include any necessary imports based on usage to prevent runtime errors (e.g., importing `math`, `copy`, `random`, etc.). Define all types explicitly if indicated or reasonably deducible from the pseudocode. Avoid adding any extraneous comments, explanatory text, or debug print statements.

Only provide the Python code enclosed in a single, properly formatted code block exactly as shown here:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Output nothing but this code block—no additional text before or after.
