Translate the provided pseudocode into fully working Python 3 code with the following requirements:

- Keep all function and class names exactly as given, including their parameters and return types.
- Preserve all class and object relationships and structures exactly as in the pseudocode.
- Import and use any relevant standard Python libraries or modules as needed to ensure correctness, readability, and efficiency.
- Use idiomatic, clean, and efficient Python constructs without sacrificing clarity.
- Handle all types appropriately, and ensure the code is syntactically correct and free of runtime errors (such as missing imports, undefined variables, or indentation errors).
- Do not add explanations, comments, or any text besides the exact translated code.
- Enclose all your code in one single Python code block formatted precisely as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Only output the Python code inside this block with no additional text before or after.  
Write code that runs correctly within a 5-second timeout for typical inputs.
