Translate the given pseudocode into fully working, efficient, and idiomatic Python code. Strictly preserve all function and class names, parameters, return types, and the original class and object structures exactly as specified in the pseudocode. Your implementation must be self-contained, correctly handle edge cases, and import any necessary standard Python modules explicitly to avoid NameErrors during execution. Use type hints as indicated or inferred from the pseudocode. Write clean, concise, and readable code, leveraging Pythonic idioms and standard libraries for clarity and performance. Avoid adding any extra explanations, comments, or text outside the code.

Enclose all your code inside a single Python code block, formatted exactly as follows:

```python
# translated code here
```

Only provide the Python code inside this blockâ€”no additional text or markup.
