Convert the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode using clear, descriptive keywords (e.g., FUNCTION, RETURN, FOR, IF, SET, WHILE). Preserve all original function and class names, maintaining exact class and object hierarchies without alteration. Represent all control structures, expressions, and operations naturally but succinctly, using full words instead of symbols or abbreviations, with consistent and correct indentation to reflect code blocks. Use meaningful variable names as in the original code. The pseudocode must enable a direct, unambiguous mapping back to the original code logic and structure. Provide only the pseudocodeâ€”do not include explanations, comments, notes, summaries, or any additional text. The output should be fully self-contained and syntactically uniform, facilitating easy understanding and verification.
