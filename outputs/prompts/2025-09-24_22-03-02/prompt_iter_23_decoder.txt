Translate the provided pseudocode into correct, clean, and efficient Python code, strictly preserving all function and class names, signatures (parameters and return types), and class/object structures exactly as given. Your translation should:

- Keep the same function and class names and definitions as in the pseudocode without modification.
- Implement all logic faithfully and ensure the code is runnable and optimized for performance within a 5-second execution time.
- Include all necessary imports from the Python Standard Library or well-known external packages if relevant, to ensure completeness and correctness.
- Follow Python best practices and idiomatic patterns for clarity, maintainability, and speed.
- Handle edge cases implied by the pseudocode and avoid runtime errors such as missing imports, undefined variables, or syntax issues.
- Not add extraneous output, explanations, comments, or text outside the code itself.
- Place the entire solution inside a single, properly formatted Python code block exactly as shown below.

Only output the Python code wrapped like this:

```python
# Your complete translated solution here
```

Do not output anything else besides this Python code block.
