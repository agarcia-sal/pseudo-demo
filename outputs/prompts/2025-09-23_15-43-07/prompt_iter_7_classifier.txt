```
You are provided with a pseudocode implementation intended to solve an unspecified programming problem. Your goal is to determine whether this pseudocode is *fully reproducible*: i.e., whether it contains sufficient explicit, unambiguous, and complete information such that an experienced programmer could implement it directly and produce a correct program that passes *all* relevant unit tests for the problem, without requiring any assumptions, guesswork, or external clarifications.

Your output must be exactly one integer per input pseudocode:
- Output **1** if the pseudocode meets *every* criterion below and is fully reproducible.
- Output **0** otherwise.
No extra text or explanation is allowed.

When analyzing the pseudocode, rigorously apply the following detailed evaluation framework:

1. **Explicit Structural Definition:**  
   - There must be a clearly identified top-level container (e.g., class, module, or main function) if the problem typically expects one.  
   - All necessary functions or methods must be explicitly defined with correct names, parameter names, counts, and expected input types or descriptions consistent with typical problem requirements.  
   - If multiple functions are interdependent, each must be defined and integrated properly (no missing definitions).  
   - All variables, data structures, and their initializations must be explicitly described with sufficient detail (e.g., list initialized with what size and value, maps/dictionaries, sets, queues, heaps, etc.).  
   - Control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion, function calls) must be fully explicated without ambiguity about their scope or execution paths.

2. **Complete Input and Output Specification:**  
   - The pseudocode must specify how all inputs are provided into the main function(s) or method(s), including exact parameter names and expected input format.  
   - The output must be clearly stated as a returned value or final result, with no ambiguity.  
   - The output must depend only on given inputs and explicitly defined computations—no hidden or implicit states allowed.

3. **Operational Clarity and Precision:**  
   - Each computational step must be described unambiguously, including arithmetic operations, logical conditions, index manipulations (with clear indexing bases), data mutations, and function calls.  
   - No vague terms (e.g., “do something”, “handle appropriately”) or underspecified actions allowed.  
   - Branching and loop termination conditions must be explicit and verifiable.  
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions must be addressed or implied by fully covering the iteration and condition ranges.  
   - Recursion or iteration bases/termination criteria must be clearly defined to prevent infinite loops/recursion.

4. **Absence of Implicit Assumptions or Missing Details:**  
   - No critical implementation details should be omitted (e.g., missing initialization, undefined variables, unspecified helper subroutines).  
   - The pseudocode should not depend on external libraries, language-specific features, or syntactic sugar without explicit explanation.  
   - Naming must be consistent to avoid ambiguity (same variable/function names used consistently).  
   - All helper constructs (e.g., helper functions, internal data structure operations) must be explicitly defined or standard and clearly described.  
   - Partial algorithms that leave key operations undefined or ambiguous must be rejected as not reproducible.

5. **Full Coverage of All Test Cases (Complete Correctness):**  
   - Consider the pseudocode only reproducible if it inherently and explicitly describes handling *all* standard input cases, including edge cases, invalid inputs (if specified), and boundary conditions.  
   - Partial correctness, approximations, or solutions missing cases—even minor ones—do not qualify as reproducible.  
   - Confirm that the pseudocode’s control flow and logic are sound enough to guarantee correct outputs for all inputs within the problem scope.

6. **Formal Consistency and Executability:**  
   - The pseudocode must be logically consistent and internally coherent as if it could be directly translated into runnable code with minimal syntactic adaptation.  
   - Function/method signatures must be complete and accurately reflect usage within the pseudocode.  
   - The overall structure should make sense in a conventional programming context (e.g., properly nested blocks, no unreachable code).  
   - Comments or non-executable descriptions may be present but must not create ambiguity regarding actual operations.

---

**Decision Procedure:**  
- If the pseudocode satisfies *all* above criteria—explicit, complete, unambiguous, with clear inputs and outputs, operational detail, and guarantees complete correctness—output **1**.  
- If *any* criterion is unmet, output **0**.  
- Partial or near-complete solutions—those missing explicit details or clarity needed for guaranteed correctness—must be labeled non-reproducible (0).

---

**Strict Output Requirement:**  
Output exactly one integer (1 or 0) per pseudocode input, in the order of inputs. No additional formatting, explanations, or deviations are allowed.
