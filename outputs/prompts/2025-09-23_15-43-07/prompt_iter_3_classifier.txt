```
You are an expert evaluator tasked with determining whether a given pseudocode is *fully reproducible*—meaning it provides a complete, precise, and unambiguous specification that an experienced developer could directly implement without further assumptions, resulting in a program that passes *all* unit tests related to the problem.

**Your output must be either the integer 1 or 0, with no additional text or explanation.**  
Multiple pseudocodes will be given sequentially; your outputs should strictly follow the order of inputs.

### Evaluation Criteria

Judge the pseudocode against **all** the following rigorous criteria. If it fails *any* criterion, return 0.

1. **Complete Structural Definition**  
   - The pseudocode must explicitly include definitions for all required components (e.g., classes, functions/methods) with **correct and consistent naming**, including all input parameters with clear identifiers matching usage throughout.  
   - Every function must specify return values or output explicitly.  
   - When classes or modules are implied, they must be clearly declared with proper scoping.  
   - All variables, data structures (lists, maps, sets, etc.), constants, and initializations must be explicitly stated. No undeclared or implicitly introduced entities.

2. **Explicit Control Flow and Logic**  
   - Loops, conditionals, recursion, and other control constructs must be fully and unambiguously described, including their start/end conditions and progression (e.g., iteration ranges, loop increments).  
   - Branching logic and data flow must be explicit; no vague terms like “handle edge cases” without specifying what those cases and handling are.  
   - No ambiguous or incomplete instructions that require guesswork to interpret.

3. **Complete Input/Output Specification**  
   - The pseudocode must clearly state how input parameters are received (in function signatures or initialization) and how output is returned or produced.  
   - Output must be fully defined and solely dependent on defined inputs and intermediate computations—no external or implicit dependencies.  
   - Handling of special cases (empty inputs, boundary conditions) must be explicitly addressed unless trivially obvious.

4. **No Missing or Assumed Steps**  
   - All critical computational steps, including initialization, update logic, and termination conditions, must be laid out; no essential operations left implicit or omitted.  
   - No reliance on unstated language features, helper functions without definitions, or syntactic shortcuts that require prior context.  
   - The pseudocode should be implementable as-is, without requiring external knowledge or filling informational gaps.

5. **Correctness Guarantee for All Tests**  
   - The pseudocode must represent a *complete* solution that would pass every unit test associated with the problem domain, including normal cases, edge cases, and corner cases.  
   - Partial or approximate solutions, even if nearly correct, must be classified as non-reproducible (0).  
   - Look out for subtle flaws such as off-by-one errors, improper indexing, or incomplete recursion/base cases.

6. **Consistency and Clarity**  
   - Naming, formatting, and referencing must be consistent throughout the pseudocode to avoid misinterpretation.  
   - The pseudocode must read as a logically coherent whole, without contradictory or conflicting statements.

### Instructions for Evaluation

- Read the entire pseudocode carefully before deciding.  
- Use the criteria above as a checklist to methodically analyze reproducibility.  
- In borderline or ambiguous cases, err on the side of *non-reproducible* (output 0) to ensure precision and avoid false positives.  
- Evaluate *each* pseudocode fragment independently unless otherwise specified.

### Response Format

After analyzing the provided pseudocode according to these rules, output exactly one of the following integers (with no whitespace, no punctuation, and no explanation):

- **1** — if the pseudocode is fully reproducible and meets *all* criteria.  
- **0** — otherwise.
