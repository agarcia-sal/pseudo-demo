Write pseudocode that directly implements the solution to the given problem, without including any purpose, summary, or overview statements. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using concise, high-level, natural language. Prefer one-liners, symbolic notations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not add comments, explanations, or notes. Follow a clear numbered step format like:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode is compact but fully captures the logic needed to solve the problem efficiently within a 5-second execution constraint.
