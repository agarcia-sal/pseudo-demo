Write pseudocode that precisely implements the given problem’s solution using the exact original function name. The pseudocode must be clear, concise, and easy to understand, employing natural language mixed with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. It should be compact and high-level, avoiding redundant details or low-level syntax. Use mostly one-liners and minimal nesting. Provide only the pseudocode steps without any purpose statements, summaries, explanations, comments, or notes.

Number each line sequentially starting from 1, following this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use variable names as in the original code. Focus on expressing control flow, data structures, and key operations succinctly. Avoid separator lines, extraneous formatting, or verbose phrasing. Ensure the logic fully captures the solution efficiently under a 5-second runtime constraint. The output must be purely the pseudocode in the specified numbered step format with no additional text or markup.
