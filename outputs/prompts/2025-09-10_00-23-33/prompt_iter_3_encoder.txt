Write concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode reflecting the given problem.  
Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations as appropriate.  
Keep pseudocode compact, high-level, and prefer one-liners. Use clear assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions with the exact same function name as the original code.  
Number each step in order starting from 1, formatted like:  
1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, notes, or purpose statements. Output only the pseudocode steps, without any separators or extra formatting.  
Use concise language but ensure the pseudocode is fully understandable and unambiguous for implementation.  
Complete within 5 seconds for best possible output.
