Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description using natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. The pseudocode should be compact, high-level, and primarily use one-liners. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow a numbered step format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use clear variable assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as appropriate. Aim for clarity and brevity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
