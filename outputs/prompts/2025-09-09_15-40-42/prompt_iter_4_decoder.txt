Translate the following pseudocode into well-structured, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that preserves the original function names and logic. Your code must execute correctly and optimally within 5 seconds for typical inputs. Use any standard Python libraries if needed for clarity or performance. Write only the Python code, enclosed within a single code block labeled `python` like this:

```python
# translated Python code here
```

Do not include any explanation, extraneous comments, or separator lines. Keep comments only if they enhance essential readability or clarify non-trivial steps. Your translation should precisely reflect all logic, variable names, control flow, and data structures indicated in the pseudocode, while leveraging Python best practices for clarity and efficiency.
