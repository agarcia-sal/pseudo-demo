Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations, be compact and high-level, and avoid comments, explanations, or any purpose/summary statements. Prefer one-liners where possible and follow this format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode itself, no additional text. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to produce the best result within this limit.
