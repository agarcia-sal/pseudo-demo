Write pseudocode to solve the given problem. The pseudocode must be concise, easy to read, and understandable, using mostly natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Use one-liners where possible and keep it high-level and compact. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format with numbered steps:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should define functions, variables, control flow, and data manipulations clearly but briefly, without detailed explanations or verbose structures. Aim to produce the best possible result within a 5-second timeout.
