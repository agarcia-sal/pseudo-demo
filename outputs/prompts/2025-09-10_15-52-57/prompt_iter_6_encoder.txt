Write concise pseudocode that directly solves the given problem using the exact function name as in the original code. Use mostly natural language mixed with clear symbolic expressions and common concise abbreviations. Keep it high-level, compact, and easy to read—prefer one-liners and minimal lines by combining statements when logical. Use indentation to indicate blocks. Format steps as numbered lines starting at 1 like this:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid any explanations, summaries, comments, or notes—output only the pseudocode itself. Use consistent naming from the problem statement. Prefer natural language phrases for clarity but keep overall brevity and correctness. Do not include separator lines or extra formatting. Provide only the pseudocode.
