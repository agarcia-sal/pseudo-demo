Write concise pseudocode to solve the given problem, preserving the exact function name from the original code. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using mostly natural language mixed with symbolic expressions and common abbreviations. Keep it high-level and compact, preferring one-liners whenever possible to clearly define variables, functions, control flow, and data manipulations. Use numbered steps starting at 1 in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include any purpose, summary, explanation, comments, or notes—output only the pseudocode itself. Avoid verbose or detailed structures; focus on clarity and brevity without sacrificing correctness. Use minimal words, appropriate indentation for blocks, and maintain consistent style and naming aligned with the problem statement.
