Translate the following pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code, preserving the exact function names and signatures implied by the pseudocode or typical problem context. Enclose your entire solution within a single Python-markdown code block formatted exactly as below:

```python
# your translated Python code here
```

Requirements:
- Use only standard Python syntax and libraries unless the pseudocode clearly requires or benefits from external packages.
- Do NOT include any wrapper classes (e.g., `Solution`) unless explicitly stated in the pseudocode.
- Write self-contained functions that match the problem’s input and output specifications.
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and performance, ensuring your code can run properly within a 5-second time limit.
- Avoid extraneous output, comments, or explanations inside the code block—only provide the functional code.
- Make sure all variables and logic faithfully reflect the pseudocode steps and control flow.

This approach ensures the code is immediately executable in isolation, prevents namespace or naming errors, and achieves the best correctness and runtime performance.
