Write concise pseudocode that solves the given problem by closely following the original code’s logic and maintaining the exact function name. The pseudocode must be compact, high-level, easy to read, and primarily use natural language with symbolic expressions and common abbreviations. Prefer one-liners for assignments, conditionals, loops, and returns when clarity allows. Use numbered steps starting at 1 and indent nested blocks appropriately, as in:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Keep naming consistent with the input problem; do not explain, summarize, comment, or add notes; output ONLY the pseudocode itself. Avoid verbose or detailed low-level mechanics—focus on clear, minimal expressions of the core logic. Do NOT present separator lines or extra formatting. The final output should be a sequence of numbered steps representing the solution in straightforward pseudocode form.
