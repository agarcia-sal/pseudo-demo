Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation, favor one-line statements, abbreviations, and compact high-level constructions. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format exactly:

1. variable ← initial_value  
2. while condition: operation  
3. for i in range: operation  

Ensure the pseudocode is understandable, compact, and uses no comments or extra explanations. Your function must complete within 5 seconds and return the best possible pseudocode accordingly.
