Generate clear, concise, and natural pseudocode directly from the problem description. Preserve all original function names exactly. Use symbolic notation for assignments (←), increments (++), and common control structures (if, else, for, while). Prefer compact one-line statements and idiomatic constructs. Avoid explanations or comments; produce pseudocode only.

Use this exact format:

1. let x ← initial_value  
2. while condition: operation  
3. for var in start to end: operation  
4. if condition: operation  
5. else: operation

Example:

in function FunctionName  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be array of size n  
read n elements into A  
for i in 0 to n-1  
  let min_i ← i  
  for j in i+1 to n-1  
   if A[j] < A[min_i]: min_i ← j  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
