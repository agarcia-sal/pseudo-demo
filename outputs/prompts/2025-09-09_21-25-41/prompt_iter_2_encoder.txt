Generate concise, high-level, and easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the given problem description. Use natural language enriched with symbolic notation, favor one-line statements, common abbreviations, and compact constructs. Maintain original function names exactly. Do not include any explanations, comments, or summaries—only pseudocode.

Follow this exact minimalistic format using assignment ←, typical control structures, and expressions:

1. variable ← initial_value  
2. while condition: operation  
3. for var in range: operation  
4. if condition: operation  

Prefer brevity and clarity with such idioms, e.g.:

in function FunctionName  
let n ← integer  
read n  
let A ← array of size n  
read n elements into A  
for i in 0 to n-1  
  for j in i+1 to n-1  
   if A[i] > A[j]: swap A[i], A[j]  
print A

Produce only the pseudocode as per above instructions.
