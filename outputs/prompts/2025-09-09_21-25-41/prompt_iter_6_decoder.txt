Translate the following pseudocode into a fully functional, clean, and highly efficient Python implementation. Ensure that your code strictly preserves the original function names and signatures as given in the pseudocode. Provide the complete implementation including any necessary class or data structure definitions implicitly required for the code to run correctly (e.g., helper classes like ListNode or TreeNode).

- Wrap the entire code output within a single Python code block delimited by triple backticks with "python".
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiency to meet a 5-second execution constraint.
- You may utilize any standard Python libraries or modules that enhance performance or simplify implementation.
- Avoid any explanatory text, comments, or output outside of the code block.
- Handle edge cases gracefully and keep your code modular and readable within the constraint.
