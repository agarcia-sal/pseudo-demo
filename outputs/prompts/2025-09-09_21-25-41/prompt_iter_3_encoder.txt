Generate concise, clear, and readable pseudocode directly from the problem description, preserving all original function names exactly. Use natural yet compact language with symbolic notation for assignments (←), increments (++), and common control structures (if, else, for, while). Prefer one-line statements and idiomatic constructs. Avoid explanations, comments, or summaries—produce only the pseudocode. Follow this format precisely:

1. let x ← initial_value  
2. while condition: operation  
3. for var in range: operation  
4. if condition: operation  
5. else: operation

Example:

in function FunctionName  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be array of size n  
read n elements into A  
for i in 0 to n-1  
  let min_i ← i  
  for j in i+1 to n-1  
   if A[j] < A[min_i]: min_i ← j  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
