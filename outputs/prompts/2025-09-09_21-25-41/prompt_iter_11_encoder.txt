Generate clear, readable, and compact pseudocode from the given problem description.  
Use natural language with symbolic notation for assignments (←), increments (++), and standard control structures (if, else, for, while).  
Preserve all original function and variable names exactly.  
Prefer concise one-line statements and high-level abstractions without explanations or comments.  
Output pseudocode numbered line-by-line as follows:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. for i in 0 to n-1: operation  
4. if condition: operation  
5. else: operation  

Example:

in function FunctionName  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
  set min_i to i  
  for j in i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
