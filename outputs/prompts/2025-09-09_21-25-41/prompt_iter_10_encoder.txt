Generate concise, clear, and compact pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic notation for assignments (←), increments (++), and standard control structures (if, else, for, while). Preserve all original function and variable names exactly. Prefer one-line statements and high-level abstractions without verbose explanations or comments. Output only pseudocode in the following format, starting lines with numbers:

1. let x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. for i in 0 to n-1: operation  
4. if condition: operation  
5. else: operation  

Example:

in function FunctionName  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i in 0 to n-1  
  let min_i ← i  
  for j in i+1 to n-1  
   if A[j] < A[min_i]: min_i ← j  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
