Generate clear, concise, and readable pseudocode from the given problem description.  
Preserve all original function and variable names exactly.  
Use a mix of natural language and symbolic notation including assignment (←), increments (++), standard control structures (if, else, for, while), and common operators.  
Prefer compact one-line statements and high-level abstractions without explanations or comments.  
Number all output lines sequentially starting at 1, following this format:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. for i in 0 to n-1: operation  
4. if condition: operation  
5. else: operation  

Example:  

in function FunctionName  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
  set min_i to i  
  for j in i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
