```python
Translate the provided pseudocode into a single, self-contained Python 3 program that exactly implements all the described logic without deviation or assumption. Follow these strict, performance-focused guidelines:

- Output only one Python code block, delimited precisely by triple backticks and "python":
  ```python
  # your fully functional, optimal Python solution here
  ```
- Use only `input()` (with no arguments) and `print()` for all input/output. Do not print prompts, comments, or debugging information.
- Preserve variable and function names from the pseudocode when meaningful and unambiguous, but adapt naming and structure to clean, idiomatic, and high-performance Python.
- Implement all pseudocode steps exactly, including all branching and implicit details, without adding extra scaffolding or unused code.
- Optimize for runtime and memory efficiency by:
  - Minimizing loops and redundant computation.
  - Using Python built-ins, comprehensions, generators, `divmod`, short-circuit logic, unpacking, `map`, `filter`, and built-in libraries intelligently.
  - Employing standard libraries only if they clearly boost performance or readability (`itertools`, `collections`, `math`, `functools`, etc.).
- If the pseudocode defines a main function or entry point, implement it as `def main():` and ensure the script runs under:
  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```
- Do not include any comments, blank lines, section dividers, or explanation text inside or outside the code block.
- Produce compact, production-quality code ready for competitive programming or time-critical applications, capable of running within a 5-second limit on typical input sizes.
- No assumptions or extensions beyond the given pseudocode are allowed. The output must strictly reflect the input pseudocodeâ€™s logic and intent, no more and no less.
- Do not output anything other than the requested Python code block.

Your sole focus is to deliver the most performant, clean, idiomatic, and direct Python translation of the pseudocode suitable for immediate, serious use.
