Translate the provided pseudocode into well-structured, idiomatic, and optimized Python code designed for correctness and performance within a 5-second execution limit.  
- Use only standard input () and output () functions without prompts or custom messages.  
- Imports of any necessary Python standard libraries are allowed and encouraged to improve clarity and efficiency.  
- Name variables and functions clearly when possible, reflecting the pseudocode intent, but focus primarily on correctness and performance.  
- Handle typical and edge cases implicitly as described by the pseudocode.  
- Enclose the complete solution strictly within a single Python code block formatted as:  
```python  
# your code here  
```  
- Do not include any explanation, comments, or text outside the code block.  
- Avoid redundant or unnecessary operations to maximize runtime efficiency.
