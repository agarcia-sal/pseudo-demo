Translate the given pseudocode into a single, self-contained, efficient, and idiomatic Python program that:  
- uses only `input()` (without prompt strings) and `print()` for I/O, exactly as shown;  
- faithfully preserves meaningful variable and function names from the pseudocode but refactors for clarity and optimal performance;  
- handles all implied edge cases and typical inputs robustly without explicit user instructions;  
- includes necessary imports from the Python standard library or popular third-party packages for clarity or speed, only if legitimately beneficial;  
- avoids any extraneous output, debugging, comments, or explanationsâ€”output only the complete runnable code inside one Python code block formatted exactly as:  
```python
# your complete translated code here
```  
- minimizes redundancy, unnecessary computations, and overhead to ensure runtime well within 5 seconds on typical problem constraints;  
- produces a fully executable and standalone script or function(s) strictly matching the logic and flow of the pseudocode, adding no wrappers or scaffolding unless explicitly specified;  
- preferably uses concise, modern Python idioms and constructs to enhance readability and efficiency without sacrificing accuracy;  
- does not include any text outside the code block.
