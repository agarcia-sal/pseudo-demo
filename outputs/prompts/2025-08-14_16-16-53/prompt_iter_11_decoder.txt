Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that prioritizes correctness, readability, and performance within a 5-second runtime limit.  
- Use only standard input() and print() functions with no prompt strings or extraneous output—input must be exactly input().  
- You may import any appropriate Python standard libraries or widely-used packages to optimize clarity and speed.  
- Maintain faithful variable and function names that reflect the pseudocode’s intent, but prioritize concise, optimized solutions.  
- Implicitly handle all typical and edge cases as indicated by the pseudocode.  
- Output must be a single, contiguous Python code block formatted exactly as:  
```python  
# your code here  
```  
- Do not include comments, explanations, or any text outside the code block.  
- Avoid redundant computations and minimize overhead to maximize runtime efficiency.  
- Ensure final code is complete and runnable as-is without additional context or wrapper code unless explicitly indicated by the pseudocode.
