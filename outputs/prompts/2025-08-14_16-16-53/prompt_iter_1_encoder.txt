Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations where possible. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, or any explanatory notes—only provide the pseudocode itself. Use mostly one-liners and a compact, high-level style. Follow this format precisely:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure clarity and understandability within these constraints. Your function must complete within 5 seconds; optimize for best possible output within this limit.
