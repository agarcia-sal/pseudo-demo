Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description.  
Use mostly natural language with compact symbolic notation and standard abbreviations.  
Express logic in short, one-line instructions combining actions and control flow where appropriate (e.g., `for i ← 0 to n-1:`, `if cond: action`, `while cond:`).  
Use simple, meaningful variable names; apply common operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `mod`, `<`, `=`, `!=`) consistently for clarity and brevity.  
Number each line starting at 1; each line must contain exactly one instruction or a logically grouped concise expression.  
Exclude comments, explanations, summaries, or any non-pseudocode text.  
Output only the numbered lines as plain text without extra formatting or labels.  

Example style to follow:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers with size n  
5. read n elements into A  
6. for i ← 0 to n-1:  
7. set min_i to i  
8. for j ← i+1 to size of A exclusive: min_i ← j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
9. swap A[i], A[min_i]  
10. print all elements of A
