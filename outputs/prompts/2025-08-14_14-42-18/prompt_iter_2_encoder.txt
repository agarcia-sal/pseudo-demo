Generate clear, concise pseudocode for the given problem description, using mostly natural language enriched with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Make it compact, high-level, and easy to follow. Prioritize one-liners and efficient expressions. Avoid comments, explanations, summaries, or any text beyond the pseudocode itself. Structure code steps with numbering starting at 1, each step as a succinct instruction or group of actions, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x ← x + 1

Use meaningful variable names but keep them short. Express control structures naturally but briefly (e.g., for i in 0 to n or if cond: action). Do not include separator lines or extraneous formatting. Only output the pseudocode with no additional text. The pseudocode should be readable and understandable without extra explanation but avoid verbosity. Aim for completion within a 5-second runtime constraint.
