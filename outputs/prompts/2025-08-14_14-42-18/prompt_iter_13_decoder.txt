Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and highly efficient Python code, enclosed entirely within a single Python code block as shown below:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Your code should:

- Use only `input()` for reading inputs (no custom prompts in `input()`).
- Include all necessary imports and helper functions explicitly.
- Avoid any explanations or commentsâ€”only provide the runnable code.
- Optimize for both readable structure and maximum performance under a 5-second runtime.
- Utilize any standard Python libraries and techniques, including advanced data structures or algorithms, to achieve this.
- Ensure your code handles edge cases and inputs robustly as implied by the pseudocode.

No additional text outside the code block should be included.
