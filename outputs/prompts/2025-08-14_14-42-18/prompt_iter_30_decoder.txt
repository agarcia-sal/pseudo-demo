You will receive pseudocode describing an algorithm or program logic. Your task is to translate this pseudocode into a fully working, optimized Python program that exactly and efficiently implements the given logic. Follow these strict directives:

- Output only a single, self-contained Python code block labeled exactly as:
```python
# your entire program here
```
with no text or comments outside this block.

- Use unprompted, plain input() calls exclusively for all inputs, respecting the input format exactly as implied by the pseudocode.

- Include every required import and helper structure explicitly; assume no pre-imports or pre-definitions.

- You may use any standard library or widely used third-party packages (e.g., numpy, collections, itertools). Prioritize efficient, idiomatic, Pythonic solutions utilizing comprehensions, generators, vectorized operations, and advanced data structures or algorithms to ensure optimal runtime and minimal memory footprint within a tight 5-second execution constraint.

- Handle all explicitly stated and logically inferred edge cases thoroughly.

- Do not produce any output besides what the problem requires—omit debugging statements, explanatory comments outside code, or extra formatting.

- Modularize code with functions or classes only if this improves clarity or efficiency; concise global scripts are acceptable if appropriate.

- Avoid redundant calculations, unnecessary data copying, or conversions. Employ lazy evaluation, streaming, or algorithmic optimizations wherever possible.

- Use consistent, meaningful variable names aligned with pseudocode semantics and Python conventions for readability and maintainability.

- Ensure the program runs correctly and immediately upon execution without any manual changes, environment tweaks, or assumptions.

Your entire response must be exactly and only the final Python code in this code block—nothing else.
