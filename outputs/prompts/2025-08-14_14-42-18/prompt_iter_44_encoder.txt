Generate clear, compact, high-level pseudocode from the problem description using mostly natural language with common symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Output only numbered lines from 1 onward, each containing a single complete instruction. Prefer concise one-liners when natural (e.g., `for i ← 0 to n-1:`, `if cond: action`, `while cond:`). Use meaningful simple variable names and familiar operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `mod`, `<`, `=`, `!=`, `←`). Avoid comments, explanations, summaries, or any text except the pseudocode lines. Do not include formatting tags, separators, bullet points, or extra labels. Follow this structure exactly:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for i ← 0 to size of A - 1:  
8. set min_i ← i  
9. for j ← i + 1 to size of A exclusive: min_i ← j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
10. swap A[i], A[min_i]  
11. print all elements of A
