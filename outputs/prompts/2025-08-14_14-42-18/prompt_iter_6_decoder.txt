Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and highly efficient Python code that executes within 5 seconds for typical competitive programming constraints. 

- Your code must handle all necessary input reading using plain `input()` calls without any prompt strings.
- Include all required imports and helper functions explicitly.
- Use only built-in Python libraries or standard modules available by default.
- Avoid any explanations, comments unrelated to code clarity, or extraneous output.
- Output only a single Python code block formatted exactly as below:

```python
# Your optimized translated code here
```

Focus on correctness, brevity, and computational efficiency to maximize performance under the time constraint.
