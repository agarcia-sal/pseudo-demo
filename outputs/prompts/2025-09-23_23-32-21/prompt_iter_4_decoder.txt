Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code while strictly preserving all function and class names, method signatures, and the original object-oriented structures exactly as described in the pseudocode. Your code should be fully self-contained and ready to run within a 5-second execution limit. Optimize for clarity, correctness, and performance without altering the logic.

Enclose your entire solution within one Python code block formatted exactly as follows:

```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

Adhere to these instructions precisely:

- Maintain all function names, class names, and their hierarchical/object relationships exactly as in the pseudocode.
- Replicate any method signatures, including argument names and default values, without modification.
- Use idiomatic Python constructs and standard libraries where appropriate to improve readability and efficiency.
- Avoid adding extraneous code, comments, or separatorsâ€”only include what is necessary for a correct translation.
- Ensure your implementation captures all control flow, data structures, and algorithmic details faithfully from the pseudocode.
- You may import standard Python packages to optimize or simplify your solution if needed.
- The final code must fit within a single contiguous Python code block without interruption.
