Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description without providing any purpose, summary, or overview. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation in a compact, high-level style. Prefer one-liners, abbreviations, and symbolic assignments. Avoid comments, explanations, or notes. Follow this format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

The pseudocode should be clear and understandable on its own. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
