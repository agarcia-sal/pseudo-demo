Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use compact, high-level steps mixing natural language with symbolic notation, prioritizing one-liners, abbreviations, and symbolic assignments. Do NOT include any purpose, summary, explanations, notes, or comments—only the pseudocode itself. Number each line sequentially as in the example below, without separator lines or extraneous formatting. Ensure the pseudocode stands on its own, understandable without additional context.

Follow this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example style your output should match:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
