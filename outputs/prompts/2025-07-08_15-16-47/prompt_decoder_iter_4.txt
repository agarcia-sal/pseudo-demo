Translate the given pseudocode into complete, well-structured, and optimized Python code that runs within 5 seconds. Your solution must:

- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Handle typical and edge cases robustly and gracefully.
- Include efficient input reading exclusively via `input()` calls with no prompt strings.
- Avoid printing unnecessary output; output only what the problem logically requires.
- Utilize any standard or third-party Python packages if they help improve clarity or performance.
- Present the entire implementation enclosed within a single Python code block marked by ```python at the start and ``` at the end.
- Exclude any extra explanations, comments unrelated to clarity, or separator lines.
- Ensure the code is ready to run as-is without modifications.
