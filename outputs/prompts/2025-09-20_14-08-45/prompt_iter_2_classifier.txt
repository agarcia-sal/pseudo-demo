Given the pseudocode below, carefully analyze whether it is fully reproducible—that is, if it can logically and unambiguously pass all relevant unit tests consistently according to its intended specification. Your assessment should consider correctness, completeness, clarity, and absence of ambiguous or missing details that would prevent reliable implementation.

Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible under these criteria, or **0** if it is not.  
Produce only the single digit output per input pseudocode, strictly no additional text or explanation.  
When multiple pseudocode snippets are provided sequentially, your outputs must correspond in order, one digit per snippet.

This prompt prioritizes rigorous logical evaluation of the pseudocode’s ability to yield consistent, testable, and fully specified behavior, maximizing reproducibility detection accuracy within a strict output format and response time limit.
