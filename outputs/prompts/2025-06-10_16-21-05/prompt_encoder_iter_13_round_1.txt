Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the problem description. Use natural, clear, and compact high-level language without explanations, summaries, or clarifications. Output only the pseudocode steps, no notes or commentary.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, followed by a single assignment or expression statement. Prefer one-liners using symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Use indentation for blocks or nesting as needed.

Example format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include separator lines or verbose constructs.

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
