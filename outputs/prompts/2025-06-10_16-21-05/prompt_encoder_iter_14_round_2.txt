Write clean, compact pseudocode that is easy to follow and understand, directly reflecting the problem description. Use natural language that is high-level yet concise, favoring symbolic notation, common abbreviations, and one-liner steps. Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, purpose, summaries, or clarifying notes.

Format each line as a numbered statement starting with an integer and a space, followed by an assignment or expression. Use indentation to show nesting. Avoid verbose constructs, separator lines, or extraneous formatting.

Use this style as a model:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
  set min_i to i  
  for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
8. print all elements of A
