Write clear, concise, and easy-to-understand pseudocode directly from the problem description using natural yet compact high-level language. Do not include any purpose, summary, explanations, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode steps.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, followed by a single assignment, expression, or control statement. Prefer one-liners, symbolic assignments (e.g., ←), common abbreviations, and simple conditions. Use indentation to denote nesting. Use natural language flow but keep it brief and high-level.

Avoid verbose constructs, notes, or separator lines.

Example style to emulate:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
  set min_i to i  
  for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
8. print all elements of A
