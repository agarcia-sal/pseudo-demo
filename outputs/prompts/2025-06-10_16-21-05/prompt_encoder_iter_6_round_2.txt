Write easy-to-read, compact pseudocode directly from the problem description using natural, high-level language that balances clarity and brevity. Output only pseudocode steps—no purpose, summaries, explanations, or comments. Use one-liner expressions and assignments wherever possible, employing symbolic notation and common abbreviations for brevity. Reflect logical structure using consistent indentation for nested blocks. Number each line starting from 1, followed by a space, then the statement.

Example format to follow strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example pseudocode style your output should emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
