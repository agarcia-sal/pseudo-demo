Write clear, easy-to-read pseudocode using natural, high-level yet compact language. Make it concise and straightforward without any explanations, summaries, or clarifying notes—output only the pseudocode steps. Use mostly one-liners, symbolic notation, and common abbreviations. Structure nested statements by indentation. Number each step starting at 1, followed by a space, then the statement. Use assignment arrows (←) or expressions and prefer natural phrasing such as "let", "read", "set", "for", "if", "while", "print".

Do not include separator lines or any verbose constructs.

Use this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
