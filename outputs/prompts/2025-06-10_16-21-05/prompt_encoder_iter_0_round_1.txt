Write concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description.  
- Use clear, natural language phrasing but keep it compact and focused strictly on logic and flow.  
- Prefer one-line statements, symbolic operators, and common abbreviations where possible.  
- Use the step-by-step numbered format demonstrated below, without separator lines or extra formatting.  
- Omit any purpose, summary, explanation, or notes—output only pure pseudocode.  

Follow this exact style:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example style to match:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
