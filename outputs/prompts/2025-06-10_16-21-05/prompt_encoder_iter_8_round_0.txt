Write clear, compact pseudocode directly from the problem description without any introduction, explanation, or comments. Use natural yet concise high-level language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Prefer single-line statements and express control structures with minimal syntax. Indent nested steps consistently. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines, formatted as:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines or verbose constructs. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, emphasizing brevity and clarity.

Example style to follow:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
