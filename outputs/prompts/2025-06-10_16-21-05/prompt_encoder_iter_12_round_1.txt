Write clear, compact pseudocode from the problem description using natural yet succinct high-level language. Omit any purpose, summary, explanation, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode steps. Keep it easy to read and understand by combining natural language with concise symbolic and abbreviated expressions.

Format output as numbered lines starting with an integer and a space, followed by an assignment or expression statement. Favor one-line statements with common pseudocode idioms and symbolic notations. Use indentation to denote nested blocks.

Example format to follow:
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not use separator lines or verbose constructs.

Example pseudocode style your output should emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
