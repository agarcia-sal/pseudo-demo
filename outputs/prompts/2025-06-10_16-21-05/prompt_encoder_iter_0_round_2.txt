Write concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description, focusing purely on the core logic and flow. Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, or purpose statements. Use natural language phrasing with clear, readable steps that remain compact. Prefer one-liners, symbolic notation, and common abbreviations to keep the code succinct. Use the following numbered format for lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include separator lines or extra formatting—output only the pseudocode steps.

Ensure the pseudocode:

- Uses natural, straightforward language that’s easy to follow  
- Operates at a high abstraction level without trivial low-level details  
- Maintains clarity and readability despite brevity  
- Expresses loops, conditionals, variables, assignments, and standard operations compactly  

Here is an example style your output should resemble:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
