Write clear, compact pseudocode directly from the problem description, using natural but concise high-level language. Output only the pseudocode steps with no explanations, notes, or summaries. Use one-liners when possible; employ symbolic notations and common abbreviations. Represent control structures with simple indentation and inline conditions.

Number each step starting from 1, followed by a period and a space, then an assignment or expression, like so:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use consistent indentation for nested blocks (tabs or spaces), omit separator lines or verbose syntax.

Example of desired style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
