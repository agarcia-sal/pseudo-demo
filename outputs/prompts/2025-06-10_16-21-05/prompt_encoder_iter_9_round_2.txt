Write clear, concise pseudocode directly from the problem description. Use natural, compact, high-level language focusing on algorithm steps only—no purpose, explanations, comments, or summaries. Output only pseudocode lines.

Format each line as a numbered step starting with an integer and a space, then an assignment or expression, preferring one-liners, symbolic operators (←, ++, etc.), common abbreviations, and natural wording. Use consistent indentation for blocks. Example format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid verbose constructs, separator lines, or extra notes.

Example of target style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
