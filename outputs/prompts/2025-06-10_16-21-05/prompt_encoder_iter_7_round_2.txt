Write clear, compact pseudocode directly from the problem description. Use natural, high-level language that balances readability and brevity. Avoid any explanations, summaries, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode steps.

Format pseudocode as numbered lines starting with an integer and a space, followed by a concise statement using symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Favor one-liners and inline conditionals where possible. Use consistent indentation for nested blocks without separator lines or verbose constructs.

Example format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
