Write concise pseudocode for the given problem description without any purpose, summary, explanations, or notes. Use clear, natural language phrasing that is compact and high-level, prioritizing readability. Prefer one-line statements, symbolic notations, and common abbreviations. Structure each step with a numeric prefix, a single space, and an assignment or expression, as in:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separator lines, verbose constructs, or detailed commentary. Focus solely on representing the algorithm’s logic and flow, using natural but succinct phrasing. Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
