Write clear, concise pseudocode that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly natural language phrased compactly at a high level, avoiding verbose syntax. Do not include any purpose, summary, explanations, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode steps. Prefer one-line statements using assignments, symbolic operators, and common abbreviations where appropriate. Use indentation strictly for control structures and nesting. Number each step starting from 1 followed by a space, then the pseudocode statement.

Use this exact format for control flow and statements:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid any separator lines or verbose blocks. Keep the output minimal but clear.

Example of desired style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
