Write concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description without adding any purpose, summary, explanations, notes, or overview statements. The pseudocode should be clear and easy to understand, use natural language phrasing, and remain compact. Prefer symbolic notations, abbreviations, and one-line statements wherever possible, strictly adhering to step-by-step numbered instructions as shown:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separator lines or any formatting other than line numbers followed by steps. Use a structured style with indentation only to denote nested blocks (e.g., loops, conditionals). The output must be strictly the pseudocode and nothing else. Aim for maximum clarity and brevity within the 10-second generation constraint.
