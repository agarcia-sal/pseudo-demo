Write clear, concise pseudocode from the problem description using compact, natural high-level language without any purpose, summary, explanations, or clarifications. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps.

Format each line as an integer followed by a period and a space, then an assignment or control statement as a single line whenever possible. Use symbolic operators and common abbreviations. Use consistent indentation (tabs or spaces) for nested blocks.  
Favor brief, straightforward statements that remain easy to understand. Avoid verbose constructs and separator lines.

Example format to follow strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
