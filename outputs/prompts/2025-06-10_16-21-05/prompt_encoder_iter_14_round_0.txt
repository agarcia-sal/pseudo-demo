Write concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the problem description, using natural but compact high-level language. Use concise one-liners with symbolic notations and common abbreviations where possible. Avoid any explanation, purpose statements, summaries, or clarifying notes—output only the pseudocode steps.

Format steps as numbered lines starting with an integer and a space, followed by an assignment or expression, using indentation for nesting. Prefer simple constructs and avoid verbose or redundant wording.

Example format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
