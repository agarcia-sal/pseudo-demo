Write easy-to-read, high-level pseudocode directly from the problem description using compact, natural language.  
Do not include purpose, summary, explanations, or clarifications. Output only the pseudocode steps.  
Use concise, mostly one-line statements with symbolic notation and common abbreviations.  
Indent nested blocks consistently with tabs or spaces.  
Number each line starting from 1, followed by a period and a space. Example format:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines or verbose control structures.  
Focus on clarity, brevity, and direct mapping from problem to pseudocode.  

Produce pseudocode styled like this example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
