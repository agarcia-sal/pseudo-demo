Write clear, concise pseudocode directly from the problem description using natural, high-level language that remains compact and easy to follow. Output only the pseudocode steps, with no purpose, summary, explanation, or clarifications.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, followed by a simple assignment, expression, or control statement. Prefer one-line statements, symbolic operators, and common abbreviations. Use indentation for nested blocks and conditions.

Example style to emulate:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
 8. set min_i to i  
 9. for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  10. set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 11. swap A[i], A[min_i]  
12. print all elements of A

Do not include separator lines, verbose constructs, comments, or notes—only numbered pseudocode lines. Use natural but compact high-level language that balances readability and brevity.
