Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the problem description. Use natural but compact, high-level language with minimal verbosity—no purpose, summary, explanations, or clarifications. Output only the pseudocode steps.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, followed by an assignment or expression statement. Prefer one-liners, symbolic operators (←, ++, etc.), common abbreviations, and natural language constructs. Use consistent indentation for nested blocks. Follow this concise style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines (e.g., “-----”) or verbose control flow keywords. Keep code clean and focused on logic.

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
