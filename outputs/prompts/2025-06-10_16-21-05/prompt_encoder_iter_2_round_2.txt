Write concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description that is easy to read and naturally phrased. Use mostly one-line statements with symbolic notations and abbreviations where possible to keep it compact and clear. Do not include any purpose, summary, explanation, comments, or overview statements—output only the pseudocode steps. Follow this exact step format and style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use natural language variable declarations like "let x be integer" or "set size of A = n." For loops, conditionals, and assignments, prefer compact expressions and inline conditions when suitable. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
