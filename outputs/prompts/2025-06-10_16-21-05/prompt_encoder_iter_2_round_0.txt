Write concise, high-level pseudocode strictly representing the problem's logic and flow. Use clear, natural language while keeping it compact and readable; prefer symbolic notations, abbreviations, and one-liners where suitable. Do not include purpose, summary, explanations, notes, or comments—output only the pseudocode lines. Number each step starting at 1, following this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use consistent indentation for nested blocks (e.g., loops, conditionals). Avoid separator lines, verbose phrasing, or extraneous details. Focus on expressing the sequence of operations clearly and efficiently to fit a 10-second generation time. For example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
