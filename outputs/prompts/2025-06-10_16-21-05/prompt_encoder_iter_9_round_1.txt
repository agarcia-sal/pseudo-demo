Write clean, high-level pseudocode directly from the problem description, using natural yet compact language that is easy to read and understand. Output only the pseudocode steps—no purpose, summary, explanations, or comments. Avoid notes or clarifications.

Format each instruction as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, then a single assignment, conditional, loop, or expression. Favor concise one-liners, symbolic operators, and common abbreviations. Use indentation to show nesting of control structures. 

Do not insert separator lines or verbose constructs.

Example format to follow:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
