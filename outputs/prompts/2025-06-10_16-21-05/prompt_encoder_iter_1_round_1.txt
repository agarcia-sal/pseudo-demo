Write concise, clear pseudocode for the given problem description, using natural, high-level language that is easy to read and understand. Avoid any purpose statements, summaries, explanations, comments, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode logic. Use compact one-liners combining control structures and assignments where appropriate, with common symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to minimize verbosity while maintaining clarity. Follow this exact numeric step format without any separator lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use variable and control names that reflect common conventions but remain brief. Express loops and conditionals inline when possible. The output should strictly focus on algorithmic flow and core logic, aiming for maximal clarity and brevity without sacrificing understandability. The pseudocode should be structured as if for an experienced programmer but remain accessible. Produce the best possible result within a 10-second time limit.
