Write clear, compact pseudocode directly from the problem description using concise, natural language that balances readability and brevity. Avoid purpose, summary, explanations, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode steps.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, then an assignment or expression statement. Favor one-liners, symbolic notations (like ←, ++), and common abbreviations. Use consistent indentation to represent nested structures. Do not use separator lines, verbose constructs, or annotations.

Example format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example pseudocode style to produce:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
