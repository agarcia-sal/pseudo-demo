Write clear, concise pseudocode for the given problem description using a natural, compact, and high-level style. Do not include any purpose, summary, explanations, notes, or comments—output only the pseudocode itself. Use symbolic notation and abbreviations where appropriate, and prefer one-liner statements to express control flow and assignments. Follow the exact step format with line numbers as shown:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Begin with function declaration if applicable (e.g., "in function main"). Use straightforward natural language phrases such as "let x be integer," "read n," "set size of A = n," "print all elements of A," and loop forms like "for i = 0 to n exclusive" or "for all elements in A." Avoid separators or additional formatting other than numbered steps.

Example style your pseudocode should emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
