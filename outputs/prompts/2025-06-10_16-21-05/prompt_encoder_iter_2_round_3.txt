Write pseudocode for the given problem description without including any purpose, summary, or overview statements. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable, using concise, high-level language with natural phrasing. Prefer one-liners, symbolic notations, and abbreviations where possible. Avoid comments or explanations. Use the following format for steps:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Your pseudocode should focus strictly on the logic and flow, aiming for compactness and clarity. The function has a 10-second timeout; produce the best result within this constraint.
