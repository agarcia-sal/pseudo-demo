Write concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the problem description using natural yet compact, high-level language. Omit any purpose, summary, explanations, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode steps. Use mainly one-liners with symbolic notations and common abbreviations.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, followed by an assignment or expression. Use indentation to show nesting and control structures. Prefer natural expressions that remain succinct and clear.

Example format to follow precisely:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines, verbose constructs, or comments.

Example pseudocode style to emulate strictly:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
