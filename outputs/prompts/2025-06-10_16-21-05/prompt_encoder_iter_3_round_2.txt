Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description using natural but compact and high-level language.  
Do not include any purpose, summary, explanation, or notes—output only the pseudocode itself.  
Use mostly one-line statements employing symbolic notation and common abbreviations.  
Structure each step as a numbered line starting with the step number, a dot, a space, and an assignment or expression, for example:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines or verbose constructs. Focus solely on clearly expressing the algorithm’s logic and flow with minimal, readable wording.  
Use the following style (example):  

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
