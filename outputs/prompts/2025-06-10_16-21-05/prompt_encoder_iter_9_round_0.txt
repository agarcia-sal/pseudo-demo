Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the problem description. Use natural yet compact, high-level language that is clear and straightforward without including purpose, summary, explanations, or notes—output only the pseudocode steps.

Use mostly one-liners with symbolic assignments and common abbreviations. Keep control structures simple and use indentation to indicate nesting. Avoid verbose constructs and separator lines.

Number each line starting from 1, followed by a space, then the statement. Use natural but succinct phrasing, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce clear variable declarations, input/output operations, loops, conditionals, and updates in a style similar to this example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
