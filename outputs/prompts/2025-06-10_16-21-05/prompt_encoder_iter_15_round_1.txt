Write clear, concise pseudocode directly from the problem description, using natural yet compact and high-level language. Produce only the pseudocode steps without any summary, explanation, or notes.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, then a statement using assignments, expressions, or control flow. Favor one-liners, symbolic operators, common abbreviations, and minimal natural language. Use indentation for nesting blocks.

Example format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include separator lines or verbose constructs.

Example style your pseudocode should follow:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
