Write clear, compact pseudocode directly from the problem description, using natural but concise high-level language. Do not include any purpose, summary, explanation, or notes. Output only the pseudocode steps, avoiding any clarifications or commentary.

Format steps as numbered lines starting with an integer and a single space, followed by an assignment or expression. Prefer one-line statements, symbolic operators, and common abbreviations. Use indentation for nested blocks consistently. No separator lines or verbose constructs.

Example format:
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
