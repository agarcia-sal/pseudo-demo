Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that strictly follows the logic and flow of the given problem description. Use clear, compact, high-level natural language phrasing with minimal verbosity. Represent control flows in one line where reasonable, using symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep the pseudocode brief. Do not include any purpose, summary, explanation, comments, or overview—only the pseudocode steps numbered as follows:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Use meaningful variable names but keep expressions succinct. Aim for clarity through well-structured steps without redundant details. For example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A

Deliver only the pseudocode output, formatted as numbered steps, optimized for readability and brevity under the 10-second processing limit.
