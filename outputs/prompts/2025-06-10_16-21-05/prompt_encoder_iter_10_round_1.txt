Write concise, clear, and readable pseudocode directly from the problem description. Use natural, high-level language that is compact and focused on essential steps without any explanations, summaries, or clarifications. Output only pseudocode lines without notes or additional commentary.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, followed by a single assignment, expression, or control statement. Prefer one-line statements, symbolic notation (←, ++, --), common abbreviations, and omit verbose keywords. Use indentation (tabs or spaces) to indicate nesting or blocks.

Follow this style precisely:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines or verbose constructs.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
