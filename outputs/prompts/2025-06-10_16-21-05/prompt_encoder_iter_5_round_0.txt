Write clear, compact pseudocode directly from the problem description using concise, natural-language style that remains high-level and easy to understand. Output only the pseudocode—no purpose, summary, explanation, or clarifications.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, followed by a single assignment or expression statement. Favor brief one-liners using symbolic operators (←, ++, etc.), common abbreviations, and natural phrasing. Use consistent indentation to indicate nesting.

Example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid verbose constructs, extraneous comments, or separator lines.

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
