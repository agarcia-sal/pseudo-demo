Write clear, concise pseudocode directly from the problem description, using natural, high-level language that is compact and easy to follow. Do not include any purpose statements, summaries, explanations, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode steps.

Prefer expressing logic in one-liners with assignments or expressions, using symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Use indentation consistently for nested blocks (loops, conditionals). Number each line starting with an integer and a space, followed by the pseudocode step.

Avoid verbose constructs and separator lines.

Format example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Produce code styled like this example exactly:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
