Write concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description using natural language that is clear and easy to read. Use compact statements with symbolic notations and common abbreviations where possible. Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, summaries, notes, or comments.

Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, followed by an assignment or expression, optionally with brief inline conditionals, as shown:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid detailed low-level syntax, separator lines, or verbose constructs. Structure control flows (loops, conditionals, functions) naturally and succinctly, emphasizing a clear logical sequence in minimal lines.

Example output style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
