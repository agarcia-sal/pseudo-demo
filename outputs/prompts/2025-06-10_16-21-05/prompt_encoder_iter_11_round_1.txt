Write clear, compact pseudocode from the problem description using high-level, natural language that remains concise and easy to understand.  
Do not include any explanations, summaries, notes, or purpose statements—output only the pseudocode steps.  
Prefer symbolic assignments, common abbreviations, and mostly one-line statements with indentation for nested structures.  

Number each step starting from 1 followed by a period and a space. Format lines as below:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not use separator lines or verbose constructs. Follow this style:  

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
