Write clear, concise pseudocode directly from the problem description using compact, natural high-level language without any explanations, summaries, or clarifications. Use one-line statements whenever possible with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Structure pseudocode with proper indentation for nested blocks. Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer and a space, followed by an assignment or expression statement. Avoid separator lines and verbose constructs.

Example style to follow:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
8.   set min_i to i  
9.   for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
10.    set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
11.   swap A[i], A[min_i]  
12. print all elements of A
