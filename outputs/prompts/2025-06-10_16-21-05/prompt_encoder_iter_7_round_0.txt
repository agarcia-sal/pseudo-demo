Write clear, concise pseudocode directly from the problem description. Use compact, natural high-level language without purpose statements, summaries, explanations, or clarifications. Output only the pseudocode steps. Prefer one-line statements, symbolic operators, and common abbreviations. Use indentation for nested blocks. Format each step as a numbered line starting with an integer, a space, then an assignment, condition, or expression (e.g., loops, conditionals). Avoid separator lines or verbose constructs.

Example format to follow strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
