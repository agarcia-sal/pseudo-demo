Write clear, compact pseudocode directly from the problem description using natural yet concise high-level language. Output only pseudocode steps—no purpose, summaries, explanations, or clarifications. Avoid notes or extra commentary.

Format the pseudocode as numbered lines starting with an integer and a space, followed by a single assignment or expression statement. Favor one-liners using symbolic notations and standard abbreviations. Use indentation to show nesting. Example format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include any separator lines or verbose constructs.

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
