Generate concise, readable pseudocode from the given problem description using a compact, high-level style with natural language and precise symbolic notation. Use mostly one-line statements combining control flow and actions when clear, employing keywords like let, set, read, print, if, else, for, while, function, return. Express assignments with “←” or “=”, conditions with conventional operators (=, ≠, <, ≤, %, //), and loop ranges using inclusive/exclusive bounds as needed.

Format output as numbered lines starting at 1. Use indentation for nested blocks but keep statements brief and clear. Avoid comments, explanations, summaries, or any extraneous text—output only the pseudocode itself.

Example style to match exactly (no additional text):

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
8.   set min_i to i  
9.   for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
10.    set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
11.   swap A[i], A[min_i]  
12. print all elements of A
