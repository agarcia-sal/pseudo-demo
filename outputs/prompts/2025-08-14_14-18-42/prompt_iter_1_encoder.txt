Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations in a compact, high-level style. Format each statement as a numbered line with simple assignments, loops, and conditions. Do not include purpose, summary, overview, notes, or explanations—only pseudocode. Prefer one-liners and avoid comments. Follow this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should be clear and understandable while meeting a 5-second output limit.
