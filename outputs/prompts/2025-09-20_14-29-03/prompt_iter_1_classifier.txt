Given the input pseudocode, determine if it is fully reproducibleâ€”that is, whether it contains all necessary steps, definitions, and logic to pass all standard unit tests for its intended purpose. Output **1** if the pseudocode is logically complete, unambiguous, and sufficient to reproduce correct results without additional information; otherwise, output **0**. Output only a single digit, no explanations or extra text.
