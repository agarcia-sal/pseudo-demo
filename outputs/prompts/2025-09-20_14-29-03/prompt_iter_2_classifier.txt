Given a piece of pseudocode, determine if it is fully self-contained and unambiguous, providing all necessary steps, definitions, data structures, and logical conditions for correctly passing all relevant unit tests without requiring any external assumptions or supplementary information.  
- Output **1** if the pseudocode is complete and executable in principle, with well-defined inputs, processing steps, and expected outputs sufficient for exact reproduction of the intended logic.  
- Output **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, missing critical components, or potentially unable to pass all unit tests as described.  

Do not provide any explanations, intermediate reasoning, or textâ€”output exactly one digit per pseudocode input, with the order of outputs matching the input order.
