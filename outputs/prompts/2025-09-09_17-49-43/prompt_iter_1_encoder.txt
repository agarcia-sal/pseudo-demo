Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be high-level, use natural language blended with symbolic notation and abbreviations, favor one-liners, and avoid comments, explanations, or purpose/summary statements. Follow this numbering format with clear steps:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Produce only the pseudocode, compact and understandable, without extra notes. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for clarity and brevity within that constraint.
