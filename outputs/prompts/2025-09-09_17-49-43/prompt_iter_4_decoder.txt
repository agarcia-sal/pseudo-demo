Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code that preserves all original function and class names as specified. Your code must maintain the same class structure and data types as indicated in the pseudocode. Enclose the entire solution within a single Python code block formatted as ```python ... ```. Optimize your implementation to run correctly and efficiently within 5 seconds. You may freely use any standard Python libraries or packages to improve clarity, performance, and correctness. Do not add any explanation, test code, or comments outside the code block. Do not alter the input/output signatures or class names unless explicitly stated in the pseudocode.
