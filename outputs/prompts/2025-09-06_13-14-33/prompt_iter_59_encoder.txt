Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description that retains the original function name exactly. Use primarily natural language with minimal symbolic notation (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod), abbreviations, and standard control structures (if, else, while, for, return, let, read, function). Write mostly one-line statements, nesting indicated by minimal indentation or spacing only when necessary. Number each step sequentially starting from 1, formatted as:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or formatting lines. Do not include variable type declarations unless essential for clarity. Focus on a clear, high-level, and compact presentation that is standalone and directly implements the solution logic. Prioritize correctness, readability, and brevity to ensure generation within 5 seconds. Output pseudocode only.
