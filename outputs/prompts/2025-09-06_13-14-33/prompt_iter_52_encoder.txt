Generate concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description, retaining the original function name exactly.  
Use mostly one-line statements combining natural language and symbolic notation with standard operators (←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod) and control structures (if, else, for, while, function, return).  
Favor compactness and readability: use natural keywords, abbreviations, and symbolic forms, minimizing indentation and line length.  
Number steps sequentially from 1, formatting control blocks inline when brief:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or formatting lines; output only the pseudocode itself.  
Ensure the pseudocode is standalone, complete, and easily understood without additional context.  
Keep variable names from the original problem when clear; otherwise, choose short intuitive names.  
Optimize for correctness, clarity, and conciseness, producing a solution within a 5-second generation constraint.
