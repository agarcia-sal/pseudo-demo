Generate concise, readable pseudocode for the given problem description that retains the original function name exactly. Use mostly natural language phrasing combined with symbolic notation (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod) for clarity and brevity. Structure the pseudocode as a numbered list of sequential steps, favoring one-line statements with minimal indentation only when needed for nested control blocks. Use common keywords such as function, let, read, for, while, if, return, but avoid comments, explanations, summaries, or formatting lines. The pseudocode should be high-level and compact yet fully self-contained and understandable without external context. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include separators or extraneous text; output pseudocode only. Optimize for clarity, correctness, and succinctness within a 5-second generation constraint.
