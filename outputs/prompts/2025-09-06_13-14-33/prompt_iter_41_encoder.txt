Generate concise, high-level pseudocode directly from the given problem description, preserving the original function name exactly. Produce clear, compact steps mostly as single lines using a mix of natural language and symbolic notation (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod) with standard control structures (let, read, for, while, if, else, return, function). Indent or add spacing minimally to clarify nested blocks. Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting—output only pseudocode statements, sequentially numbered:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Favor brief, expressive lines using natural phrasing. Ensure the pseudocode is complete and understandable standalone without context. Do not add separator lines or headings. Optimize for readability, correctness, and generation speed within 5 seconds.
