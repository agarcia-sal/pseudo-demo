Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that retains the original function name exactly as given. Write in clear, natural language merged with symbolic notation and standard control structures (e.g., let, if, for, while, return, function, ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod), focusing on brevity and readability. Use mostly one-line statements, minimizing indentation or spacing except where necessary to clarify nested blocks. Number steps sequentially as shown:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or decorative lines—output only the standalone pseudocode solution, fully understandable without context. Prefer idiomatic, compact phrasing and abbreviations that retain clarity. Ensure completeness, correctness, and easy comprehension, optimizing for quick generation within 5 seconds.
