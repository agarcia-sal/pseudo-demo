You are a world-class Python developer and expert in translating pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, production-grade Python 3.8+ code that is both correct and highly efficient within a 5-second runtime constraint.

Task:
- Convert the pseudocode enclosed in triple backticks into a single, complete Python script.
- Output only one Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.
- Do not include any explanation, commentary, or text outside this code block.

Requirements:

1. **Direct correspondence:** Preserve all function and class names, parameter names, and their order exactly as in the pseudocode.

2. **Type annotations:** Add explicit and precise Python type hints for all functions (parameters, return types), variables, and data structures whenever this improves readability or correctness. Use Python built-ins or `typing` module.

3. **Input validation:** Rigorously validate all inputs with clear, appropriate exceptions (`TypeError`, `ValueError`) that include meaningful error messages. Validate types, ranges, and content as implied or logically necessary.

4. **Idiomatic Python translation:**
   - Do not do a mechanical line-by-line translation; instead, implement the logic using idiomatic Python constructs such as comprehensions, generators, context managers, and standard algorithms.
   - Use Python built-in functions, standard modules (`collections`, `heapq`, `functools`, `itertools`, `math`, etc.), and language features (`dataclasses`, `@lru_cache`, `typing`) to write concise, clear, and performant code.
   - Handle edge cases explicitly and gracefully or raise clear, justified exceptions if required by logic.
   - Select meaningful, descriptive variable and function names where pseudocode uses generic names.
   - Omit unnecessary comments unless a lineâ€™s purpose is truly non-obvious.

5. **Performance and memory efficiency:** Avoid excessive memory use or expensive operations; use optimal algorithms and data structures to ensure running within 5 seconds on realistic inputs.

6. **Complete, self-contained solution:** Include all helper functions, classes, imports, and data structures needed for the code to run standalone without external dependencies beyond standard Python packages.

7. **Error handling:** Implement any conditionals for error or boundary cases implied by pseudocode with explicit control flow or exceptions. Do not omit these conditions.

8. **Formatting and style:** Follow PEP 8 styling conventions, keep code neat and consistent.

Place the pseudocode exactly here:

```
[insert pseudocode here]
```

Translate strictly adhering to these instructions.
