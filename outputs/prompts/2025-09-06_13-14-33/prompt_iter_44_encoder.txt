Generate concise, clean pseudocode preserving the original function name exactly. Write in a natural, readable style using mostly one-line statements with symbolic operators (←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod) and standard, natural keywords (function, let, read, for, while, if, else, return). Keep it high-level and compact but fully precise and standalone—understandable without any explanation or comments. Avoid notes, summaries, or formatting lines. Use indentation or spacing only minimally to clarify nested blocks. Number each step sequentially starting from 1, following this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Favor abbreviations and symbolic expressions where possible, output just pseudocode lines without extra text or separators, optimize for clarity, correctness, and generation speed within 5 seconds.
