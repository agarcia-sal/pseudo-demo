Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation, keeping the pseudocode high-level and compact. Use mostly one-liners and abbreviations, avoid comments, explanations, purpose statements, or summaries. Format steps clearly and sequentially, for example:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Return only the pseudocode, ensuring it is understandable without extra notes. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best output within this limit.
