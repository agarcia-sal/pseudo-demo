Generate concise, high-level pseudocode directly from the given problem description using the exact function name from the original code. Make the pseudocode easy to read and self-explanatory by blending natural language and symbolic notation, favoring compact, mostly one-line statements with minimal but clear use of indentation only for nested blocks. Use natural phrasing such as "let", "read", "for", "if", "return", while employing symbolic operators (←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod, XOR) and standard control structures.

Avoid comments, explanations, summaries, or any extra formatting or separators. Present the pseudocode as a standalone, complete solution understandable without additional context.

Number each step sequentially, following this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

When possible, keep loops and conditional bodies on the same line for brevity. Use abbreviations prudently to maintain clarity. Minimize total lines without sacrificing readability or completeness.

Output only the pseudocode. Your response must strictly adhere to these guidelines and optimize for correctness, clarity, and succinctness within a 5-second timeout.
