Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that retains the original function name exactly as given. Make it easy to read by blending natural language with standard symbolic operators (←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod), favoring mostly one-line statements with minimal and purposeful indentation only to show nested blocks. Use natural keywords like let, read, for, while, if, else, return, function, and define succinct helper routines inline if needed. Express loops and conditionals compactly in the form:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, formatting lines, or separators. Produce only the complete pseudocode that stands alone and clearly solves the problem within 5 seconds. Strive for a balance of clarity, brevity, and correctness by using natural phrases where appropriate, symbolic notation, and abbreviations. Structure and number lines sequentially starting at 1. Output only the pseudocode.
