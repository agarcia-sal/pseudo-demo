Generate concise, clear pseudocode for the given problem description that preserves the original function name exactly. The pseudocode should be compact, mostly one-liners, using symbolic operators (←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod) and standard control structures (for, while, if, else, return, function). Favor natural language combined with symbols, keeping it high-level and easy to read. Indent or add spaces only minimally to clarify nested blocks. Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or separator lines—output only pseudocode. Number steps sequentially as in:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use natural keywords like let, read, for, if, return, function, but keep lines brief and expressive. Ensure the pseudocode is complete, standalone, and understandable without any external context. Optimize for clarity, correctness, and brevity to fit within a 5-second generation limit.
