Generate concise, clear pseudocode that preserves the original function name exactly. Use mostly one-line statements combining natural language and standard symbolic notation (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod) to keep it high-level, compact, and easy to read. Prefer natural keywords like function, let, read, for, if, while, return but keep lines brief and expressive. Indent or use spacing only where essential to reflect nested structures clearly. Number each step sequentially starting at 1, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not output any explanations, summaries, comments, notes, or formatting lines—only pseudocode. The output must be standalone and understandable without extra context. Optimize for clarity, correctness, and minimal length within a 5-second generation time.
