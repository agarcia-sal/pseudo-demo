Generate clear, concise pseudocode for the given problem description that retains all original function names exactly as provided. Express the solution compactly and at a high level using mostly one-line statements combining natural language and standard symbolic notation (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod). Favor abbreviations and succinct forms, using common keywords such as let, read, for, if, while, return, function, define, but keep each line brief and expressive. Use indentation or spacing sparingly—only to clarify nested control structures. Structure steps sequentially and number them starting from 1, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include any comments, explanations, summaries, extra formatting lines, or notes—output pseudocode only. Ensure the pseudocode is standalone, complete, and understandable without additional context. Prioritize clarity, correctness, and brevity, optimizing for a generation time under 5 seconds.
