Generate concise, clear pseudocode for the given problem description that preserves the original function name exactly. Use a compact, high-level style blending natural language and symbolic notation with standard control structures and operators (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod). Prefer mostly one-line, abbreviated statements; indent or space only as needed for clarity in nested blocks. Use natural keywords like function, let, read, if, while, for, return, but keep each line brief and expressive. Number each step sequentially starting at 1, in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or formatting lines—output pseudocode only. Make the pseudocode complete and standalone, understandable without extra context. Prioritize readability and correctness, ensuring it stays within a 5-second generation time limit. Avoid separator lines or extra markup.
