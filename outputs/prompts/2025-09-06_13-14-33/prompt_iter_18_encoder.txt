Generate concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode for the given problem description, strictly preserving the original function name. Use mostly one-line statements blending natural language with symbolic operators (←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod). Favor a compact style that is easy to read and understand, employing standard control structures (for, while, if, else, function, return, let, read) and abbreviations. Indent or add spaces only as needed for nested blocks. Output pseudocode lines sequentially and numerically, starting at 1, in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include explanations, summaries, comments, or formatting lines—output pseudocode only. Ensure the pseudocode is complete, standalone, and understandable without extra context. Avoid separator lines or extraneous syntax. Optimize for correctness, brevity, readability, and test-time efficiency within a 5-second limit.
