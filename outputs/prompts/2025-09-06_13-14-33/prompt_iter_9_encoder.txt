Generate clear, concise pseudocode for the given problem description that preserves the original function name. Use a blend of natural language and symbolic notation to produce a high-level, compact, and readable solution. Favor mostly one-line, abbreviated statements with standard control structures and symbolic operators (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod). Indent or space only as needed to clarify nested blocks. Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or formatting lines—output pseudocode only. Structure steps sequentially and numerically, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use natural keywords like let, read, for, if, return, function, but keep lines brief and expressive. Ensure the pseudocode is complete and standalone, understandable without context. Optimize for correctness and clarity within a 5-second generation limit.
