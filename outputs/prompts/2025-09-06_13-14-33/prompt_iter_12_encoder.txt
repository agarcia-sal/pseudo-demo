Generate concise, readable pseudocode that retains the original function name exactly as given. Use mostly natural language with minimal symbolic notation (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod) and standard control structures (e.g., let, read, if, for, while, return, function). Favor brief one-line statements and keep indentation or spacing minimal, only to clarify nested blocks. Number each step sequentially starting from 1, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Your output must be just the pseudocode—no explanations, summaries, comments, or formatting lines—and produce a complete, standalone solution that is easily understood without external context. Keep it compact, high-level, and optimized for correctness, clarity, and speed within 5 seconds.
