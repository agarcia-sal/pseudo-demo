Generate concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description that retains the original function name exactly.  
Make it mostly one-liners, mixing natural language with symbolic operators (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod) and standard control structures (for, while, if, else, return, function).  
Use clear, compact expressions and abbreviations to keep the pseudocode brief yet fully understandable.  
Indent or add spaces only as needed to show nested blocks clearly.  
Number all steps sequentially starting at 1, using the format:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting lines—output pseudocode only.  
Ensure the entire solution is self-contained and understandable without any external context or notes.  
Prioritize readability, correctness, and brevity to fit within a 5-second generation time.
