Generate concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description, preserving the original function name exactly. Use mostly one-line, compact statements mixing natural language and symbolic notation (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod) with minimal necessary indentation to indicate control structure blocks. Favor natural keywords such as let, read, for, if, while, return, function, but keep lines brief and expressive. Number each step sequentially starting at 1, format control structures inline or with minimal nesting:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce complete pseudocode only—no explanations, comments, summaries, or decorative lines. Structure the solution to be standalone and immediately understandable without additional context. Strive for clarity, correctness, and brevity, outputting the result within a 5-second generation limit.
