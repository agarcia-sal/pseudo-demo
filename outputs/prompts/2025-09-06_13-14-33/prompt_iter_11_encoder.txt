Generate concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description using the exact original function name. Use mostly one-line statements mixing clear natural language with standard symbolic notation and operators (e.g., ←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod). Express control structures simply but precisely (e.g., for, while, if, else), indent or space only to clarify nested blocks minimally. Avoid explanations, comments, notes, purpose statements, summaries, or formatting lines—output pseudocode only, fully self-contained and understandable without external context. Follow this numeric step format, preferring brevity and clarity:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Favor natural keywords like let, read, return, function, set, append, define, but keep lines short and expressive. Use standard data structure names (array, list, map, set) and concise iteration/assignment forms. Optimize for readability, compactness, and correctness within a 5-second generation limit.
