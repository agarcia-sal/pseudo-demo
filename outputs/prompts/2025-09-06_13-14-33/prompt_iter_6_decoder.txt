Translate the given pseudocode into clean, readable, and highly efficient Python code, preserving the exact function names as defined in the pseudocode. Your implementation must be optimized for performance to execute well within 5 seconds, leveraging Pythonâ€™s standard library or any third-party packages if they improve clarity or speed. Include appropriate type annotations where reasonable, and ensure correctness and clarity remain paramount.

Wrap your entire Python solution inside a single code block formatted as follows:

```python
# Your code here
```

Pseudocode:
```
[insert pseudocode here]
