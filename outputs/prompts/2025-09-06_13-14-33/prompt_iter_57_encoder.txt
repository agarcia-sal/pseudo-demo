Generate concise, clear pseudocode preserving the original function name. Write high-level, compact lines blending natural language and symbolic notation using standard control structures and operators (←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod). Prefer mostly one-liners and abbreviations; indent or space only minimally for nested blocks. Use natural keywords like function, let, read, if, else, for, while, return. Structure steps sequentially and numerically, e.g.:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

The pseudocode should be standalone and fully understandable without context. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or formatting separators—output only pseudocode. Output pseudocode compactly, readable, and optimized for correctness within a 5-second generation limit.
