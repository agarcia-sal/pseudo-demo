Generate concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode directly from the given problem description or source code, preserving exactly all original class names, function names, parameter names, and signatures in their original object-oriented structure.

Use mostly natural language combined with standard programming symbols and constructs: assignments ←, conditionals, loops, function calls, returns; prefer compact one-line statements when clarity permits. Use abbreviations and simple phrasing but keep the pseudocode straightforward, logically complete, and easy to read.

Number every line sequentially from 1 in this exact format (including the ← symbol), for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include blank lines, separators, comments, explanations, or summaries. Do not modify any names or structures from the source. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines without anything else.
