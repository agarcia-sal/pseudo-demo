Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a high-level style with natural language, symbolic notation, one-liners, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this numbering format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and compactness, using simple constructs and avoiding unnecessary detail. Your pseudocode should be understandable at a glance and complete within a 5-second generation limit.
