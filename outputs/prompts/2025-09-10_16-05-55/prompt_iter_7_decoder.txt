Translate the provided pseudocode exactly into correct, efficient, and runnable Python code. Follow these strict instructions:

- Keep the **function name, parameters, and signature exactly as given in the pseudocode**.
- Implement all logic inside the function without enclosing it in any class, unless explicitly instructed by the pseudocode.
- Include **all necessary import statements** at the top of the code block if external modules are required.
- Your code must be syntactically correct and optimize to run within 5 seconds for typical input sizes.
- Handle any data structure or input format conversion that is implied but not explicitly stated, ensuring the function can be called directly with standard Python data types.
- **Return only the final Python code**, enclosed in a single triple-backtick code block with `python` specified (no explanations, no comments, no additional text).

Example output format:

```python
# Function name and signature exactly as pseudocode
def exampleFunction(params):
    # complete implementation
    ...
```

Now, translate the given pseudocode into this format precisely.
