Generate concise, clear pseudocode from the provided problem description and original code. The pseudocode must:

- Retain the exact original function name.
- Use mostly natural language phrasing combined with symbolic notation for brevity and clarity.
- Prefer compact, mostly one-line statements using standard control flow constructs (if, for, while, etc.) and common abbreviations.
- Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or extra formatting—output only the numbered pseudocode steps.
- Format each line as:  
  1. x ← 0  
  2. while x < n: x++  
- Use consistent numbering starting from 1 and no other separators or metadata.
- Keep pseudocode complete, logically consistent with the original implementation, easy to read and understand without additional context.
- Favor natural language expressions where they improve readability without losing precision.
- Aim to deliver full pseudocode within a 5-second response time limit.
