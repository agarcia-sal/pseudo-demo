Generate concise, clear pseudocode from the given problem description and the original implementation. The pseudocode must:

- Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation; keep it compact, high-level, and easy to read.
- Preserve all original function names exactly as in the code.
- Prefer mostly one-line statements, standard control structures (if, for, while, etc.), and common abbreviations without sacrificing clarity.
- Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode steps.
- Number each line starting from 1, using this exact format with no extra formatting or separators:  
  1. x ← 0  
  2. while x < n: x++  
- Maintain completeness and logical correspondence to the original function’s logic.
- Do not include any extra formatting, blank lines, or separators.
- Within 5 seconds, produce the entire pseudocode for the function, ensuring it is self-contained and understandable without additional context.
