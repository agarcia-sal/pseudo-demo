Translate the given pseudocode into correct, well-structured, and efficient Python code that preserves the exact function name and signature specified in the pseudocode. Your implementation must be fully contained inside a single Python code block using triple backticks with "python".  
- Adhere strictly to the original function and variable names as in the pseudocode.  
- Include all necessary imports if your code requires external modules.  
- Do not wrap your function inside any class unless explicitly instructed by the pseudocode.  
- Complete the implementation so that the resulting code runs correctly and efficiently within 5 seconds for typical input sizes.  
- Provide only the final codeâ€”do not include explanations, comments, or any additional text outside the Python code block.  

Example format:  

```python
# Your Python code here with exact function name from pseudocode
def exampleFunction(params):
    ...
```
