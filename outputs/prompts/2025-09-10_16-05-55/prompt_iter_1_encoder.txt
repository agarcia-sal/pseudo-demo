Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should use natural language mixed with symbolic notation, be compact and high-level, and avoid comments, explanations, or overview statements. Use mostly one-liners, abbreviations, and standard control structures. Follow this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include purpose, summary, or clarifying notes—only the pseudocode. Prioritize clarity and brevity within a 5-second response time.
