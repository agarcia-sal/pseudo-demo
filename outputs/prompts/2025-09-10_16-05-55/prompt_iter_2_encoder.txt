Generate clear, concise pseudocode from the given problem description and original code. The pseudocode must:

- Use mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation, focusing on compactness and high-level clarity.  
- Preserve all original function names exactly as given.  
- Favor mostly one-liners, standard control structures (if, for, while, etc.), and common abbreviations where suitable.  
- Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or any descriptive sentences—output only the pseudocode steps.  
- Output numbered lines starting at 1, exactly following this format:  
  1. x ← 0  
  2. while x < n: x++  
- Keep pseudocode brief, easy to read, and understandable without extra context.  
- Do not include separator lines or extra formatting beyond line numbers and statements.  
- Ensure the pseudocode is complete and corresponds logically to the original function implementation.  
- Aim to produce the entire pseudocode within the 5-second response limit.
