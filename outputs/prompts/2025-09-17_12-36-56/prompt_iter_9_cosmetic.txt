Given the original pseudocode, produce a rewritten version that replicates its full functionality while maximizing syntactic and structural differences. Preserve all original function names, class names, and their hierarchical relationships exactly as in the input. Avoid adding any comments, explanations, or annotations—output only the transformed pseudocode. Use alternative control structures, variable names (except function/class names), expression formats, data access methods, and order of operations wherever possible to diversify the code’s form without altering its behavior.
