Given the original pseudocode, produce a logically equivalent version that preserves all functionalities exactly but is rewritten to maximize structural, syntactic, and stylistic differences. Keep all class names, function names, and their scopes precisely the same as in the original. Do not alter the class or object hierarchy or introduce/remove any classes or methods. Perform thorough renaming of variables (except function and class names), reorder statements where correct and safe, replace control structures with alternatives (e.g., switch between loops and recursion, conditionals reordered or inverted), and vary expressions and data structure usage while preserving semantics. Avoid any comments or explanationsâ€”output only the transformed pseudocode. Ensure the output pseudocode is clear, unambiguous, and can be directly understood as functionally equivalent to the original.
