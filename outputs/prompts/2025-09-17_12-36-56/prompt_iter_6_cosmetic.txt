Given the original pseudocode, produce a version that is functionally equivalent but rewritten to maximize syntactic and structural divergence. Preserve all original class names, function names, and class/object hierarchies exactly as given, without any changes. Your rewrite must vary control flow constructs, variable naming, data structure usage, and statement organization while maintaining original logic and behavior.

Output only the rewritten pseudocode without any explanations, comments, or annotations. Avoid direct line-to-line mapping; instead, restructure loops, conditionals, and assignments to improve dissimilarity. Maintain the same input/output interfaces and logical outcomes precisely.
