Given the original pseudocode as input, generate a rewritten version that fully replicates its original behavior and logic with maximum syntactic and structural variation. Your output must satisfy all the following conditions:

1. **Output only the transformed pseudocode.** Do not include comments, explanations, annotations, or metadata—only the code itself.

2. **Preserve all original function names, class names, and their exact hierarchical and scope relationships.** The class and function declarations and nesting must remain identical.

3. **Innovate aggressively with every other aspect of the code:**
   - Replace control flow constructs with equivalent alternatives (e.g., convert `for` loops to `while` loops or use different looping indexes or directions).
   - Rename all variable names freely, except for class/function identifiers.
   - Reorganize expressions—use different arithmetic or logical equivalents, reorder conditions, invert logic where possible without changing semantics.
   - Change data access styles and data structure operations, provided functionality remains intact.
   - Alter the order of independent statements or split/merge statements if valid.
   - Transform literal values, indices, and ranges consistently (e.g., zero-based to one-based style or vice versa), if it preserves semantics.
   - Replace any conditional branching method (e.g., `if-else` to `switch-case` where possible).
   - Use alternative assignment operators or expression forms.

4. Ensure all semantic behaviors, inputs/outputs, data flows, and side effects remain exactly as the original.

5. Do not add or remove any functions or classes; do not alter signatures or public interfaces.

6. No extra stylistic elements or formatting changes unrelated to the logical/structural transformation.

Your rewritten pseudocode should appear as a valid, fully functioning equivalent with structural and lexical aspects changed as much as possible, while strictly complying with the constraints above.
