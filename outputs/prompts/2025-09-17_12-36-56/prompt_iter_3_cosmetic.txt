Given the original pseudocode, rewrite it to produce a semantically equivalent version that preserves all original functionality while maximizing structural, syntactic, and stylistic differences. Retain all original class names, function names, and the class/object hierarchy exactly as in the input. Change all variable names, control flow constructs (loops, conditionals), data structure usage, and formatting freely to produce a distinctly different pseudocode style and organization. Avoid adding comments or explanations; produce only the rewritten pseudocode as output.
