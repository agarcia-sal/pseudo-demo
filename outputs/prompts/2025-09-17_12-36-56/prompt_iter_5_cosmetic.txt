Given the original pseudocode, rewrite it to preserve *exactly* the same functionality while maximizing syntactic and structural differences. Keep all class names and function names exactly as in the original, and maintain the original class and object hierarchy without adding or removing any classes or functions. Alter all other elements freely: variable names, control flow constructs (e.g., switch between for, while, recursion, or conditionals), data structures, statement ordering (where safe), formatting, and style. Avoid using any comments or explanations; output only the rewritten pseudocode. Your goal is to produce pseudocode that would be as dissimilar as possible at a surface level yet operationally equivalent.
