Rewrite the given pseudocode so that it preserves the exact same logic, class hierarchy, and function names, but is expressed with as many structural, syntactic, and lexical variations as possible. This includes but is not limited to:

- Using alternative control flow constructs (e.g., replace for-loops with while-loops or vice versa)
- Changing variable names to different meaningful identifiers (except function and class names)
- Reordering independent statements where feasible
- Utilizing different ways of expressing the same operations (e.g., different assignment styles, conditional expressions, or loop boundaries)
- Altering formatting, indentation style, and expression grouping
- Modifying the use of intermediate variables (introducing, combining, or removing them while maintaining functionality)

Do not change the given function names, class names, or their nesting and structure.

Provide only the rewritten pseudocode as output. Do not include any explanation, comments, or notes.
