Generate concise, compact pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be easy to read and high-level, using natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations where appropriate. Produce only the pseudocode—no comments, explanations, summaries, or purpose statements. Prefer one-liners for simple statements and loops. Use consistent indentation for nested blocks. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Focus on clarity and brevity without sacrificing understandability. Use phrases like "let x be integer," "read n," "for i = 1 to n," "if condition then," "set," "swap," and natural control flow keywords. The pseudocode should resemble this style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
