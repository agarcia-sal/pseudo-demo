Given a piece of pseudocode representing an algorithm or function, determine if it is **fully reproducible**, meaning it is self-contained, logically sound, and detailed enough to **pass all valid unit tests** for its specified functionality without relying on any external information or implicit assumptions.

To decide, rigorously verify if the pseudocode fulfills **ALL** of the following conditions:

1. **Explicit Definitions and Initialization:**  
   All variables, data structures, constants, parameters, and functions used are clearly declared or defined before usage. No element is ambiguous or undefined.

2. **Complete and Unambiguous Logic Flow:**  
   Control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion) are fully specified, covering all necessary cases and termination conditions with no infinite loops or dead code. All expressions and operations are clearly described, with well-defined indexing, ranges, and types.

3. **Deterministic and Precise Behavior:**  
   The pseudocode produces a unique and predictable output for any valid input. There are no underspecified steps, random or non-deterministic actions, or unclear modifications to state.

4. **Sufficiency for Output Reproduction:**  
   The computation contains every step required to produce the final output relevant to the problem. No essential processing steps, intermediate results, or aggregations needed for correctness and testing are omitted or vaguely referenced.

5. **Self-Containment:**  
   The pseudocode does not depend on external definitions, hidden states, undocumented assumptions, or background context outside what is provided within it or standard constructs clearly identified as such.

6. **Correct and Consistent Use of Syntax/Notation:**  
   Any indexing, tuple/list/dictionary referencing, arithmetic, or Boolean operators are consistent, well-formed, and match the usual conventions stated or implicitly understood in the given pseudocode format.

**Instruction:** For each pseudocode input, after carefully evaluating it against the above criteria, output **exactly one line** containing **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (meets all conditions), or **0** otherwise.

**Important:**  
- Output must be strictly and only `1` or `0` per input, no extra text, explanation, or symbols.  
- Output lines must correspond in order exactly to the order of pseudocode inputs.

This instruction set is designed to balance precision with generality, addressing both the logical integrity and practical completeness needed for reproducibility, while eliminating false positives/negatives caused by subtle definitional or coverage gaps.
