Given any pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, **determine with absolute certainty if it is fully reproducible**, meaning the pseudocode is **explicit, complete, deterministic, unambiguous, self-contained, and logically sufficient** to **reliably and unconditionally pass all valid unit tests** for its specified functionality.

You must output exactly `1` if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** of the following rigorous criteria. Otherwise, output `0`.

### Comprehensive Reproducibility Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Explicit Definitions and Declarations**  
   - Every variable, parameter, constant, data structure, function, and class used is explicitly declared or fully defined before use, including data types or clearly inferable types.  
   - Initialization states, value domains, and constraints are clearly specified or logically deducible without ambiguity.  
   - No hidden or implicit dependencies on external code, global state, environment, or external libraries not described within the snippet.

2. **Deterministic, Comprehensive, and Exhaustive Logic**  
   - All control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion) are precisely and exhaustively described with explicit termination conditions; no infinite or ambiguous loops.  
   - All potential edge cases, boundary conditions, and special inputs (empty, minimal, maximal, pathological) are either explicitly handled or clearly accounted for by the logic.  
   - No nondeterministic constructs (e.g., randomness, concurrency, timing) unless explicitly and reproducibly defined therein.

3. **Complete and Precise State and Data Management**  
   - All updates, computations, and state transformations are fully specified with no implicit or missing steps.  
   - Indexing conventions (0-based or 1-based), tuple/list element positions, and operators are consistently and clearly defined or conventionally understood.  
   - Data manipulations avoid ambiguous shorthand; all references to elements or subcomponents are unambiguous and consistent.

4. **Explicit Input and Output Specifications**  
   - Inputs are explicitly named, typed, and their valid ranges or constraints are directly stated or logically inferred.  
   - Outputs (return values or side effects) are clearly defined in type and expected format, with no ambiguity or partial description.

5. **Logical Coherence and Semantic Transparency**  
   - The pseudocode is logically coherent: every step meaningfully contributes to the defined goal with no unexplained leaps, hidden assumptions, or gaps in reasoning.  
   - Helper functions or subprocedures, if any, are fully described and internally consistent without external dependencies.

6. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The snippet can be executed and fully understood without requiring unstated preprocessing, postprocessing, external state, or undocumented conventions.  
   - Any common constructs or idioms used follow standard definitions or are explicitly introduced.

7. **Unambiguous and Consistent Notation**  
   - The pseudocode’s syntax and semantics are consistent, free of contradictory or confusing shorthand.  
   - Notation for data structures, control flow, and operators is clear, uniform, and interpretable in a single, logical manner.

8. **Implicit Assumptions Clarified or Absent**  
   - If any assumptions are necessary (e.g., data sortedness or input constraints), they are explicitly stated within the pseudocode or problem context.  
   - No reliance on unstated conventions or domain-specific knowledge that cannot be inferred from the pseudocode itself.

### Output Format and Instructions:

- Analyze the pseudocode snippet strictly against the above criteria.  
- Output exactly one line containing only:  
  - `1` if the pseudocode **fully satisfies** every criterion and can be expected to deterministically pass **all valid unit tests without exception**;  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- Process and answer for multiple pseudocode snippets in the order they are given, producing one output line per snippet.  
- Do **not** include any explanations, comments, or additional text—only `0` or `1`.  
- Strictly adhere to the order of inputs and outputs—they correspond 1:1.

This prompt is designed to deeply scrutinize **explicitness, determinism, logical completeness, and semantic clarity** while aggressively minimizing false positives on pseudocode with hidden assumptions or ambiguity and false negatives on correct, sufficiently detailed pseudocode. It elevates reproducibility assessment to a level required for robust automated verification across diverse programming problems and domains.
