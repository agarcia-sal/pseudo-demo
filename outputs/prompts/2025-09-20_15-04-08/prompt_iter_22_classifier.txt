Given any pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, determine **with complete certainty** if it satisfies **all conditions required for full reproducibility**, defined as the capability to be implemented and executed to **unfailingly pass all relevant unit tests** for its stated purpose.

Output exactly one line per pseudocode snippet with:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**,  
- `0` otherwise.

**Do not output anything else.** Preserve strictly the input order.

### Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must hold):

1. **Explicit and Complete Declarations:**  
   - All variables, inputs, constants, data structures, helper functions, and classes appear explicitly defined or declared before use.  
   - Data types, valid value ranges/domains, and initial values or states are either clear or uniquely and logically inferable with no assumptions on external systems or hidden state.  
   - No references to undefined entities, external libraries, or unspecified side effects.

2. **Unambiguous, Exhaustive Control Flow and Logic:**  
   - Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) are fully specified with clearly stated conditions and finite termination guarantees.  
   - All possible cases, including edge and boundary conditions, are addressed explicitly or reliably inferable.  
   - No implicit shortcuts, vague steps, or unexplained omissions in execution order or state modifications.

3. **Deterministic Behavior Across Valid Inputs:**  
   - The algorithm produces exactly one well-defined output for every input within stated constraints.  
   - Any randomness is either absent or explicitly described in a reproducible manner (fixed seeds, deterministic generation).

4. **Explicit, Self-Contained Computation:**  
   - All intermediate computations, transformations, and data manipulations required to produce the final outcome are fully described without delegation to unspecified or external functionality.  
   - No reliance on implicit domain knowledge, background context, or side effects outside the pseudocode.

5. **Precise Input and Output Specifications:**  
   - Inputs (parameters, arguments) are explicitly declared with type information or sufficiently descriptive semantics.  
   - Outputs (return values or side effects) are clearly stated, including structure, type, or expected format.

6. **Consistent and Clear Syntax, Notation, and Semantics:**  
   - Notation (variable names, data structure references, indexing schemes, operators) is coherent, consistently applied, and unambiguous.  
   - Indexing bases (0-based vs. 1-based) and element referencing follow explicitly stated or universally accepted standards without contradictions.

7. **Complete Standalone Presentation:**  
   - The pseudocode is fully self-contained; it requires no additional background, context, or external system knowledge beyond widely accepted fundamental programming concepts.  
   - Conventional pseudocode constructs are either standard or explicitly defined in the snippet.

### Instructions for Evaluation:

- Analyze the pseudocode's semantics and structure in depth with respect to every criterion listedâ€”do **not** rely on partial correctness or assumptions.  
- If **any single criterion fails**, output `0`. If **all criteria are satisfied**, output `1`.  
- Output only `0` or `1` per input pseudocode, in the exact input order, with no additional text or formatting.

This rigorous, all-encompassing reproducibility standard maximizes fidelity of evaluation and minimizes errors by explicitly verifying semantic completeness, syntactic clarity, and deterministic self-containment, enabling consistent assessment of arbitrary pseudocode algorithms across diverse problem domains.
