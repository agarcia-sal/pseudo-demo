Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, **determine with absolute certainty whether the pseudocode is fully reproducible**, meaning it is sufficiently precise, complete, self-contained, and unambiguous to reliably and deterministically **pass all correct unit tests** for its stated functionality across all valid inputs.

Return `1` if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** of these enhanced reproducibility criteria; otherwise, return `0`.

### Enhanced Rigorous Criteria for Pseudocode Reproducibility

1. **Comprehensive Declaration and Clear Definition:**  
   - Every variable, constant, input, data structure, function, method, and class used is clearly and explicitly declared or defined **prior to use**.  
   - Data types (or intuitive equivalents), initial states or values, valid ranges or domains, and constraints are clearly specified or logically uniquely inferable.  
   - Identifiers are unambiguous and consistent throughout the pseudocode; no dangling references or implicit external dependencies unless explicitly declared.

2. **Complete and Deterministic Execution Semantics:**  
   - All control structures (conditionals, loops, recursion) fully specify the conditions, including boundary and edge cases. Termination conditions are precise and guarantee halting.  
   - Iteration ranges, indexing conventions, and data accesses are explicitly defined and consistent, with no vague ranges or implicit off-by-one ambiguities.  
   - Each step of computation, including intermediate states and transitions, is exhaustively described; no shortcuts, skipping, or assumed steps occur.

3. **Explicit and Unambiguous Input-Output Interface:**  
   - Input parameters, their data types, expected formats, and constraints are precisely described.  
   - Outputs (return values or side-effects) are fully specified by type, structure, and intended semantics.  
   - The functional contract (what inputs produce which outputs) is well-defined and reproducible.

4. **Deterministic Behavior and Outcome Consistency:**  
   - The pseudocode produces exactly one deterministic output for every legal input within defined constraints.  
   - Any randomness or probabilistic behavior, if used, is explicitly described with reproducibility mechanisms (e.g., fixed seed or deterministic generation).

5. **No Hidden or Implicit Dependencies:**  
   - No reliance on external libraries, frameworks, environment states, or previous executions unless explicitly specified and fully defined.  
   - All helper functions and classes invoked are fully detailed or defined within the snippet.  
   - Conventional pseudocode constructs must follow widely accepted meanings or be clearly introduced.

6. **Clear, Consistent, and Unambiguous Notation and Syntax:**  
   - Syntax usage (assignments, function calls, control-flow constructs) is internally consistent and interpretable without confusion.  
   - Indexing style (0-based or 1-based) and data structure element referencing are explicitly stated or follow standard conventions unambiguously.  
   - Variable naming and operand use are consistent, avoiding overloaded or conflicting symbols.

7. **Logical Integrity and Semantic Soundness:**  
   - The pseudocode’s logic is coherent and sound, with no contradictory or impossible conditions.  
   - Any loops or recursive calls have clearly defined exit conditions ensuring no infinite execution.  
   - All variable updates and data transformations maintain internal consistency.

### Instructions for Decision and Output

- Perform an in-depth semantic and structural analysis of the pseudocode against the above criteria.  
- For each pseudocode input snippet, output exactly one line containing either:  
  - `1` — if it is fully reproducible and can reliably pass all valid unit tests under all stated conditions, or  
  - `0` — if it fails any one or more of the reproducibility standards.

- Output lines must strictly maintain the order corresponding to the input pseudocode snippets.  
- Output **only** the digits `1` or `0` per line. No additional text, comments, or formatting is allowed.

This refined prompt emphasizes absolute precision, clarity, and completeness in pseudocode reproducibility assessment. It explicitly addresses previous subtle failure modes by demanding exact input-output contracts, explicit indexing and control flow semantics, consistent notation, and zero tolerance for ambiguity or implicit dependencies — resulting in significantly improved accuracy and robustness in determining reproducibility across diverse problem domains.
