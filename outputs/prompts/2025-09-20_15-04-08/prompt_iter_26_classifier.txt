Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, **determine with maximal precision and confidence whether the pseudocode is reproducible**, i.e., whether it is sufficiently explicit, unambiguous, complete, and self-contained to reliably and deterministically **pass all valid unit tests** for its declared functionality in any programming environment.

Your output must be exactly one digit per pseudocode snippet:  
- Output `1` if, and only if, the pseudocode meets **every aspect** of all reproduction requirements below.  
- Output `0` if it fails **any** one or more criteria.

### Definitive Reproducibility Assessment Checklist:

1. **Absolute Completeness of Definitions and Declarations:**  
   - All variables, parameters, constants, data structures, subroutines, classes, and auxiliary elements are **explicitly declared or defined before use**.  
   - Data types, value domains, initial states or conditions are either explicitly given or uniquely and logically inferred without ambiguity.  
   - No references to undeclared or implicitly assumed entities, external modules, hidden state, or system-specific context.

2. **Explicit and Exhaustive Control Flow and Logic Coverage:**  
   - All algorithmic control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion, iterations) are specified with precise termination criteria and consider all edge cases and boundary conditions.  
   - No infinite loops or underspecified conditions; all possible execution paths are addressed explicitly or logically exhaustively.  
   - Sequence and ordering of computational steps, state changes, and side effects are fully articulated and never skipped.

3. **Deterministic Behavior and Unique, Well-Defined Output per Valid Input:**  
   - For every valid input within declared constraints, the pseudocode produces exactly one deterministic output.  
   - No nondeterministic or probabilistic constructs unless fully described alongside their reproducible seed/state initialization.  
   - Outputs, return values, and side-effects are explicitly defined with types and structures clearly specified.

4. **Complete Computational Transparency:**  
   - All intermediate calculations, transformations, and auxiliary computations necessary for the final result are shown or described unambiguously.  
   - No reliance on unspecified external computations, magical functions, or hidden domain knowledge.

5. **Strict Self-Containment and Independence:**  
   - The pseudocode is a standalone unit sufficient for implementation without external context, dependencies, hidden environment assumptions, or domain-specific shorthand that is not universally understood.  
   - Any pseudocode syntax, operators, or constructs conform to common, well-understood standards or are clearly introduced and explained.

6. **Consistent, Precise, and Parseable Notation and Syntax:**  
   - Notation for variables, indexing, data access, operators, and control structures is clear, internally consistent, and standard or fully defined.  
   - Index bases (0-based or 1-based), tuple/list element orderings, string indexing, and other language-like conventions must be unambiguously specified or follow conventional norms.

7. **Fully Specified Inputs and Outputs:**  
   - Inputs (parameters, arguments) are declared with types and semantic meaning sufficient to understand valid input ranges and formats.  
   - Outputs are clearly described with exact type, form, and meaning (return value or side-effect).

### Instructions for Response:

- Conduct a thorough semantic, structural, and logical analysis based solely on the pseudocode provided, without invoking external knowledge or assumptions beyond the given text.  
- Output exactly one line per pseudocode input, with a single character either:  
  - `1` if the pseudocode passes **all reproducibility criteria** above, or  
  - `0` if it violates one or more criteria.  
- Preserve the order of inputs in your outputs; no missing or extra output lines.  
- Output no extra text, explanation, formatting, or whitespace besides the digits `0` or `1`.

### Additional Explicit Clarifications to Improve Accuracy:  
- Treat "reproducibility" as **full implementability and correctness guarantee**, covering usual edge and corner cases.  
- Implicit or informal assumptions about indexing, data structures, or environment should be treated as failures.  
- Overly terse, ambiguous, or partially sketched logic (e.g., "do something here" without detail) is not reproducible.  
- Pseudocode that relies on external libraries or environment-specific features without definition is not reproducible.  
- For nested or auxiliary functions, their full logic and contracts must be included and clear.  
- Variable shadowing, naming collisions, or inconsistent naming conventions are disallowed if they cause interpretation ambiguity.

This refined prompt imposes uncompromising rigor and unambiguity, significantly reducing classification errors by explicitly demanding complete, precise, consistent, and fully self-contained pseudocode that deterministically passes all valid tests in all relevant scenarios.

**End result: strict, reliable binary reproducibility classification: `1` for pass, `0` for fail, nothing else.**
