Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, determine with absolute precision whether it is **fully reproducible**—that is, it contains sufficient, unambiguous, and self-contained information to successfully **pass all valid unit tests** for its declared specification.

Your output must be exactly a single digit:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is reproducible, meeting **all** the criteria below,  
- `0` otherwise.

Output exactly one such digit per pseudocode input, strictly preserving the input order. Output no explanations, comments, extra whitespace, or formatting—only the digits `0` or `1`.

### Essential Criteria for Reproducibility (All Must Be Satisfied)

1. **Explicit and Complete Variable, Data, and Interface Declarations:**  
   - Every variable, input parameter, constant, data structure, and auxiliary function/class referenced is clearly declared or defined *before* usage.  
   - Types or clear descriptions of variable roles, valid ranges, and initialization values are present or logically inferable without guesswork.  
   - The input-output interface (function signatures, parameters, return types/formats) is clearly defined.

2. **Self-Containment Without External Dependencies:**  
   - The pseudocode stands alone without relying on external code, hidden state, undocumented libraries, or unstated context beyond universally accepted pseudocode conventions.  
   - All helper procedures, subroutines, and transformations essential to the final output are included or explicitly described.

3. **Unambiguous, Complete Control Flow and Logic:**  
   - All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) are well-defined, covering all logical branches and edge cases; there are no infinite loops or implicit termination assumptions.  
   - Indexing, boundary checks, and iteration limits are explicitly stated and consistent with declared data sizes.  
   - Operations, expressions, and algorithmic steps have no ambiguity—no placeholders, no informal or vague steps that undermine deterministic interpretation.

4. **Deterministic and Well-Formed Execution Behavior:**  
   - The pseudocode deterministically produces exactly one correct output for any valid input in stated constraints.  
   - Any source of non-determinism or randomness is either absent or specified explicitly with fully reproducible mechanisms.

5. **Sufficient Detail to Reconstruct All Computations:**  
   - All intermediate results, data transformations, state updates, and aggregations necessary to derive the output are fully described.  
   - No critical steps are omitted, glossed over, or left as unexplained external dependencies.

6. **Consistent and Standardized Notation and Syntax:**  
   - The pseudocode uses consistent, conventional notation for assignments, data structures, indexing, and expressions throughout.  
   - Any specialized notation or system-specific conventions must be clearly explained or self-evident.  
   - No contradictory or ill-formed statements are present.

7. **Explicit Handling of Edge Cases and Error Conditions:**  
   - The pseudocode explicitly accounts for boundary conditions, empty inputs, exceptional states, and other special cases relevant to correctness.  
   - No silent assumptions or ignored conditions that could cause test failure.

### Instructions

- Rigorously analyze the entire pseudocode input against **all** the above criteria.  
- Output `1` only if *every* criterion is fully satisfied, guaranteeing that the pseudocode can reliably pass any valid unit test for its declared task.  
- Otherwise, output `0`.  
- Maintain strict **one-line-per-pseudocode** output.  
- Do **not** output explanations, hints, or any non-numeric content.

This approach combines explicit, exhaustive checklist-style validation with a sharp emphasis on practical reproducibility and deterministic completeness. It is designed to maximize accuracy, minimize false positives/negatives, and generalize across arbitrary algorithmic pseudocode inputs. Use this as a decisive, standard criterion for reproducibility evaluation.
