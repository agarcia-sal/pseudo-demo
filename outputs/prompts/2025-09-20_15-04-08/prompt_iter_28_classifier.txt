Given any pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm, function, or method, your task is to determine with absolute precision whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, defined as being **complete, explicit, logically sound, and self-contained enough to unambiguously, deterministically, and reliably pass all valid unit tests for the described functionality** under all valid input conditions.

---

### Instructions for Evaluation:

- Output exactly one line per pseudocode snippet, containing only:  
  - `1` if the pseudocode meets **all** reproducibility criteria below, or  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- The output order must strictly correspond to the input order of pseudocode snippets.  
- Output no explanations, comments, or formatting beyond the single digit.

### Rigorous Criteria for Full Reproducibility

The pseudocode must satisfy **all** of the following categories comprehensively:

1. **Comprehensive Explicitness and Definitions**  
   - All variables, parameters, constants, functions, classes, and data structures are explicitly declared or defined before first use.  
   - Types and domains (value ranges or constraints) for all inputs, variables, and outputs are clearly stated or logically deducible without ambiguity.  
   - Initializations are unambiguously given or logically inferable.  
   - No implicit assumptions about external data, environment, or unseen global state.  
   - Any referenced helper functions or procedures are defined fully within the snippet or clearly documented with deterministic behavior.

2. **Deterministic and Exhaustive Control Flow and Logic**  
   - All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) are precisely described with explicit, well-formed, and terminating conditions.  
   - All logical branches, including edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, extremal conditions, potential exceptions), are handled explicitly or are safely inferable to prevent undefined behavior.  
   - No nondeterministic elements (randomness, concurrency, external state changes) unless fully self-contained and reproducible within the pseudocode.

3. **Clear, Precise, and Consistent Data and State Manipulation**  
   - Every variable update, state mutation, and intermediate computation step is explicitly specified without omissions or hidden side effects.  
   - All indexing schemes, element access patterns, and collection manipulations have clearly defined semantics and consistent usage throughout (e.g., zero-based vs one-based indices explicitly stated or contextually unambiguous).  
   - Data structure invariants or assumptions (e.g., sortedness, uniqueness) are explicitly declared or clearly supported by the code.

4. **Explicit Input/Output Specification**  
   - Inputs are named, typed, and constrained such that valid calls are unambiguous.  
   - Outputs (return values, side effects) are fully described in terms of type, format, and semantics.  
   - No omitted output behaviors or side effects.

5. **Complete Self-Containment and Context Independence**  
   - The snippet must not rely on undocumented preprocessing, postprocessing, or external facilities beyond common, standard pseudocode conventions.  
   - Common programming idioms or constructs must be either standard or explicitly defined.  
   - No reliance on outside assumptions such as environment variables, hardware quirks, or external APIs.

6. **Unambiguous and Well-Formed Notation and Syntax Consistency**  
   - Syntax and semantics throughout the pseudocode are consistent, cleanly formed, and non-contradictory, allowing unambiguous interpretation.  
   - Naming and referencing conventions (e.g., variable names, tuple element positions) are uniform and clearly understood in context.  
   - Arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations are clearly defined.

7. **Semantic Clarity, Logical Cohesion, and Completeness**  
   - The snippetâ€™s structure reflects a logically sound algorithm with no gaps, shortcuts, or assumptions left unexplained.  
   - Every component meaningfully contributes to achieving the stated functionality.  
   - Helper or nested functions/procedures integrate seamlessly and deterministically.  
   - The flow of data and control is coherent and interpretable without contradiction.

### Summary

Your judgment should be based on whether the pseudocode snippet can be executed as-is, without any external clarification or supplementation, to produce correct and consistent results that satisfy all relevant input scenarios and hence pass all legitimate unit tests for its stated purpose.

**Remember:** Output only `1` or `0`, strictly one line per snippet, and preserve input order in output.
