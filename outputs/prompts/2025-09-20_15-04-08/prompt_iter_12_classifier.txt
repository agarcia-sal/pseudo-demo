Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm, function, or class, **determine with absolute certainty whether the pseudocode is fully reproducible**, meaning it is precise, unambiguous, self-contained, and sufficiently complete to reliably and deterministically **pass all valid unit tests** relevant to its declared behavior and input-output specification.

Your output must be exactly one digit per pseudocode input snippet:

- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** the rigorous reproducibility criteria below and can be reliably implemented and tested without additional assumptions.  
- Output `0` otherwise.

### Enhanced Reproducibility Assessment Criteria

1. **Complete and Explicit Declarations**  
   - All variables, inputs, constants, data structures, helper functions, and classes used are explicitly declared or clearly defined **before use** with precise semantics.  
   - Data types, valid value ranges, initial states, and constraints are either explicitly stated or can be *uniquely and unambiguously inferred* without guesswork.  
   - No ambiguous symbols or undeclared external dependencies; all references must resolve within the snippet.

2. **Unambiguous, Fully Specified Control Flow & Logic**  
   - Every possible branch, loop, and recursion path is fully and explicitly described, including all boundary conditions and termination clauses, ensuring no infinite or undefined execution paths.  
   - Iteration indices, array/list boundaries, element referencing/indexing rules (including 0- or 1-based conventions) are clear, consistent, and adhered to throughout.  
   - Precise sequencing of operations and state updates leaves no gaps or implied “magic” steps.

3. **Deterministic Results on All Valid Inputs**  
   - For *every* input within the defined constraints, the pseudocode produces exactly one deterministic, well-defined output.  
   - Any randomness or nondeterministic behavior is either absent or fully specified to be reproducible (e.g., seed stated).

4. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The pseudocode can stand alone without invocation from unknown external code, reliance on unspecified libraries, hidden side effects, or domain-specific assumptions beyond common programming conventions.  
   - All required support code or constructs are included or perfectly standard and explicitly mentioned.

5. **Thorough Input and Output Specification**  
   - Input parameters are clearly named and typed or described with semantic clarity, including data structures and expected formats.  
   - Outputs are explicitly identified with data type, structure, or value description, including side effects if any.

6. **Complete Computational Detail and Transparency**  
   - All intermediate computations, transformations, and updates necessary to produce outputs are explicitly described; no steps are deferred or glossed over.  
   - No opaque calls or black-box operations absent detailed pseudocode explanation.

7. **Clear, Consistent Notation and Syntax**  
   - Syntax conventions (assignment, conditional tests, function call formats) remain consistent throughout, enabling unambiguous interpretation without syntactic conflicts or contradictions.  
   - Data structure manipulations, element indexing, tuple/list operations strictly follow the declared or widely accepted norms.

8. **Robust Handling of Edge and Special Cases**  
   - Edge cases (empty inputs, minimal/maximal sizes, invalid inputs under constraints) are explicitly handled or logically covered by the pseudocode’s branching and condition logic.

### Decision and Output Instructions

- Perform a **deep semantic, syntactic, and structural analysis** of the entire pseudocode snippet with respect to the above criteria.  
- Output **one line of exactly one character** (`1` or `0`) for each pseudocode snippet, preserving the **input order**.  
- Output **no other text, explanation, or whitespace** beyond the sequence of `1` and `0` digits corresponding exactly to the inputs.

This prompt integrates an explicit multi-layered checklist and emphasizes absolute completeness, full determinism, and total self-containment, addressing subtle failures on well-formed but incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode. Its clarity and precision aim to maximize accuracy and consistency in reproducibility classification across diverse problem domains and styles.
