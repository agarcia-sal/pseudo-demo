Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm, function, or class, **determine with complete certainty whether this pseudocode is fully reproducible**, meaning it contains everything necessary—precise, unambiguous, and self-contained—to deterministically and reliably **pass all relevant unit tests** for its specified behavior.

You must output exactly one line per supplied pseudocode snippet, containing **only a single digit:**  
`1` — if and only if the pseudocode is reproducible under the criteria below, or  
`0` — otherwise.

### Essential Reproducibility Requirements (all must hold):

1. **Complete and Explicit Definitions:**  
   - Every variable, parameter, function, class, constant, and data structure is clearly declared or introduced before use.  
   - Data types, valid ranges, initial states, or construction rules are either explicitly specified or uniquely and logically inferable without guesswork.  
   - No undefined references or reliance on implicit or external contexts.

2. **Precise, Exhaustive Logic and Control Flow:**  
   - Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) are fully described without ambiguity or infinite/unbounded iterations.  
   - All decision branches and boundary cases relevant to the specification are covered explicitly or logically implied with no gaps.  
   - The entire operation sequence—including intermediate steps and state changes—is given without omissions or shortcuts.

3. **Deterministic, Well-Defined Output Behavior:**  
   - The output for any valid input within stated constraints is singular, unambiguous, and reproducible every run.  
   - Any randomness or nondeterminism is either absent or fully described with reproducible initialization.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence:**  
   - The pseudocode is fully standalone with no hidden dependencies on external libraries, runtime state, environment, or domain knowledge beyond common programming abstractions.  
   - All helper routines, algorithms, or data manipulations must be visible or clearly specified inline or within the snippet.

5. **Input-Output Specification Clarity:**  
   - Inputs are explicitly declared with sufficient typing or semantic descriptions.  
   - Outputs or return values are precisely defined with type and structure, describing expected results or side effects clearly.

6. **Unambiguous Notation and Syntax Consistency:**  
   - Syntax, operators, indexing schemes (0-based or 1-based), and data access are consistently applied and standard or explicitly defined.  
   - Variable and data references are unambiguous and consistently used throughout.

### Evaluation Instructions:

- Conduct an exhaustive, semantic, and structural analysis of the pseudocode snippet, rigorously checking **all** the above criteria.  
- Your output must be exactly the digit `1` if the pseudocode satisfies every condition for reproducibility, or `0` if it fails any.  
- Output results **in the exact order** the pseudocode snippets were given.  
- Output nothing else: no explanations, no formatting, only the digits `0` or `1`—one line per snippet.

This prompt demands a **strict, comprehensive validation** of pseudocode reproducibility by balancing logical completeness, unambiguous detail, and self-sufficiency. It is designed to **maximize accuracy and minimize both false positives and false negatives** across any algorithm or problem domain within a strict 5-second evaluation time.
