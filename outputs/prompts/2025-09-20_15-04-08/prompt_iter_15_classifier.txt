Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm, function, or program, analyze it **deeply and holistically** to determine whether it is **fully reproducible**, i.e., whether it contains sufficient, precise, unambiguous, and complete information to guarantee that any competent programmer or automated system can implement it exactly and it will deterministically **pass all valid unit tests for the described functionality and inputs**.

---

### Your output must be exactly one digit per input pseudocode snippet, in the same order, with:

- `1` — if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** of the reproducibility requirements below rigorously, ensuring absolute confidence that it can be directly and reliably implemented without ambiguity, omission, or implicit dependencies, and will produce correct outputs for all valid inputs as specified.  
- `0` — if it fails to satisfy **any one or more** of these strict conditions.

---

### Comprehensive Reproducibility Requirements:

1. **Explicit Declarations, Definitions, and Initializations:**  
   - All variables, constants, data structures, functions, classes, parameters, inputs, and outputs are clearly declared or described *before* use.  
   - Input domains, data types, allowed value ranges, and initial values or states must be unambiguously stated or fully inferrable from context without guesswork.  
   - No usage of undefined or externally assumed symbols, variables, or state; no hidden dependencies on external code, notions, or system-specific behaviors.

2. **Complete and Precise Algorithmic Logic:**  
   - Control flow statements (loops, conditionals, recursion) exhaustively cover all branch conditions and paths.  
   - Termination and boundary conditions are explicitly and clearly defined, ensuring no infinite, ambiguous, or partially described loops or recursions.  
   - All computations, state updates, and transitions are fully specified in sequence, with no skipped or elided steps that are critical for correctness.

3. **Input-Output Specification and Determinism:**  
   - Inputs and outputs are explicitly and precisely defined by type, format, and semantics.  
   - For every valid input, the pseudocode produces a single well-defined output deterministically; if randomness occurs, it must be explicitly described with reproducible behavior.  
   - Side effects, if any, are fully documented and consistent with output expectations.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence:**  
   - The pseudocode is a standalone artifact, not requiring external libraries, hidden assumptions, or background knowledge beyond standard programming concepts universally accepted.  
   - Any nonstandard operations or domain-specific notations are explicitly introduced and unambiguously described.

5. **Clarity, Consistency, and Unambiguity in Syntax and Notation:**  
   - Variable names, data structures, indexing conventions (0-based vs 1-based), data types, operations, and control flows use consistent and well-defined syntax throughout.  
   - No contradictory or ambiguous statements; precision in referencing data elements and ordering of operations.

6. **Exhaustive Handling of Edge and Corner Cases:**  
   - All relevant edge cases (empty inputs, minimal and maximal values, boundaries, exceptional conditions) are explicitly or logically covered within the description.  
   - No gaps remain that could cause undefined or unpredictable behavior under any valid input.

7. **Explicit and Complete Handling of All Computational Steps:**  
   - All intermediate data transformations and helper computations required for final results are fully included and described.  
   - No placeholders, ellipses, or references to “standard functions” without explicit definition or known universal meaning.

### Instructions for Your Decision:

- Carefully perform **deep semantic analysis, logical inference, and structural validation** on the pseudocode against every reproducibility criterion above.  
- Output a single line per provided pseudocode snippet: `1` if it meets all criteria, else `0`.  
- The output lines **must preserve the input order exactly**.  
- Output **nothing else** — no explanations, commentary, or formatting characters; just the digits `0` or `1`.

This prompt aims to minimize false positives and false negatives by emphasizing exhaustive explicitness, unambiguous completeness, deterministic correctness, and rigorous, universal clarity, thereby reliably distinguishing pseudocode that is truly reproducible from that which is deficient in essential details.
