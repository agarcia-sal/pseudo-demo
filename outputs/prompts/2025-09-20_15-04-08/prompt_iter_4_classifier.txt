Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, determine with rigorous precision whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, meaning it is sufficiently detailed, self-contained, and unambiguous to successfully **pass all valid unit tests** for its declared purpose.

Your decision must be based on a strict evaluation against these criteria, all of which must be met to output `1`. Otherwise, output `0`.

**Reproducibility Criteria:**

1. **Complete Explicitness:**  
   - All variables, parameters, constants, data structures, helper functions, and classes used are **explicitly declared or defined** before use.  
   - Types, initial values, and relevant ranges are clearly provided or implied unambiguously.  
   - No placeholders, missing definitions, or references to unspecified external context.

2. **Unambiguous and Exhaustive Logic:**  
   - Control flow structures (conditionals, loops, recursion) cover **all logical branches and termination conditions**â€”no infinite loops, no missing case handling.  
   - Indexing, boundary conditions, and ranges are clearly stated and consistent.  
   - Operations, expressions, and algorithmic steps are precisely described without ambiguity or implicit assumptions.

3. **Deterministic Behavior:**  
   - For any valid input within stated constraints, the pseudocode yields a **single, predictable output**.  
   - No underspecified choices, probabilistic or non-deterministic steps unless explicitly defined with reproducible randomness.

4. **Sufficiency of Detail to Achieve Output:**  
   - All necessary intermediate computations, data transformations, and aggregations to arrive at the final output are present.  
   - No essential step or dependency is omitted, vague, or deferred to undefined external logic.

5. **Self-Containment:**  
   - The pseudocode stands alone: no reliance on hidden states, external libraries, background knowledge, or undocumented assumptions outside standard programming constructs clearly customary in pseudocode.

6. **Consistent and Correct Notation:**  
   - Syntax and notation usage (assignments, tuple/list/dictionary operations, indexing, arithmetic and logical operators) are internally coherent, well-formed, and follow conventional interpretations or any stated system conventions.

7. **Clarity in Input-Output Interface:**  
   - The input parameters and function signature are clearly declared, with types or descriptions.  
   - The output is explicitly specified and returns the expected data type and format.

**Instructions:**

- Analyze the pseudocode carefully against every above criterion.  
- If **all** criteria are fully satisfied, output exactly the single digit `1`.  
- If **any** criterion is not met, output exactly the single digit `0`.  
- Output exactly one line per input pseudocode snippet.  
- Output lines must strictly correspond in order to the input pseudocodes.  
- Do **not** output explanations, commentary, or extra symbols/formatting; output only `0` or `1`.

This systematic, all-encompassing checklist is designed to maximize accuracy and minimize false positives/negatives by enforcing rigorous evaluation of completeness, clarity, logical integrity, and stand-alone sufficiency. Use it to assess reproducibility of arbitrary pseudocode inputs reliably and consistently.
