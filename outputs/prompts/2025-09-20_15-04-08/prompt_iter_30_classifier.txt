Given any pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm, procedure, or function, **determine with absolute certainty whether it is reproducible**—defined as it being sufficiently explicit, unambiguous, and complete to **deterministically and reliably pass every relevant unit test for its stated functionality**.

**Output exactly one line per pseudocode snippet, containing either `1` if the snippet is fully reproducible or `0` otherwise. Output nothing else. The order of outputs must match the input order.**

### Definitive Reproducibility Checklist:  

Evaluate the pseudocode against all the following mandatory criteria, without exception:

1. **Complete and Explicit Definitions**
   - **All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, and functions (including helpers) are explicitly declared or defined prior to use.**  
   - **Types (explicit or inferable without ambiguity), valid ranges/domains, and initial values for all data elements must be provided or logically derivable.**  
   - No hidden or implicit assumptions about global state, environment, or external libraries not defined/allowed in the pseudocode.

2. **Exhaustive and Deterministic Control Flow**
   - All conditional branches, loops, and recursions are precisely specified with concrete and finite termination conditions.  
   - **Every possible input condition, including boundary and edge cases (empty input, minimal/maximal values, special values), is explicitly handled or logically implied to be safe and defined.**  
   - No sources of nondeterminism or randomness unless they are explicitly presented along with a reproducible mechanism (e.g., fixed seed or deterministic sequence).

3. **Unambiguous and Complete State Updates**  
   - All state changes, list/array updates, and computations explicitly define how variables and structures evolve step-by-step.  
   - Indexing schemes (0-based, 1-based, etc.) and data references must be clearly stated or standard and consistently applied.  
   - No vague or partial descriptions of operations, no implicit data mutations.

4. **Precise Input/Output Contracts**  
   - Inputs must be clearly named, typed, and constrained.  
   - Outputs must be clearly described, including format, data type, and return values or side effects.

5. **Self-contained Scope and Logical Cohesion**  
   - The pseudocode must be fully self-contained: no reliance on unstated preprocessing, postprocessing, external state, nondocumented libraries, or hidden context.  
   - All helper functions/procedures must be defined in-line or documented explicitly.  
   - Commonly accepted constructs are allowed only when their meaning is standard or explicitly defined.

6. **Consistent Syntax, Notation, and Semantics**  
   - Syntax must be internally consistent, well-formed, and free from conflicting interpretations.  
   - Operations, operators, and data structure manipulations must follow a single clear convention consistently throughout the snippet.

7. **Semantic Clarity and Logical Completeness**  
   - Every part of the pseudocode must contribute concretely to achieving the overall goal; no unexplained assumptions, shortcuts, or gaps in logic.  
   - The flow and purpose of all computations must be clearly inferable without guesswork.

### Process

- Rigorously analyze the pseudocode applying the above checklist.  
- Decide **`1`** if and only if the pseudocode passes every item perfectly, guaranteeing it will unambiguously and reliably succeed on all valid tests. Otherwise, decide **`0`**.

---

### Output Requirements

- Output exactly one line per pseudocode snippet.  
- Each line contains a single character: `1` or `0`.  
- **No explanations, no extra characters, no whitespace beyond the output line ending.**  
- Outputs must be in the exact order pseudocodes are provided.

This prompt elevates reproducibility judgment by strictly enforcing **total explicitness, exhaustive edge coverage, deterministic behavior, and holistic self-containment**—eliminating false positives and false negatives everywhere from minimal to complex pseudocode across all problem domains.
