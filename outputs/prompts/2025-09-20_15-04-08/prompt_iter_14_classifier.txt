Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, **determine with absolute certainty whether the pseudocode is fully reproducible**, i.e., it is sufficiently explicit, unambiguous, logically complete, and self-contained such that it can be reliably and deterministically executed to **pass all possible valid unit tests** for its declared behavior.

Your output must be exactly one digit:  
- `1` if and only if the pseudocode unquestionably satisfies **every** requirement below, ensuring guaranteed reproducibility and correctness;  
- `0` if it fails any part of these requirements or presents any ambiguity, incompleteness, or dependency that could cause test failures or nondeterminism.

### Definitive Criteria for Full Reproducibility:

1. **Complete and Explicit Definitions:**  
   - All variables, constants, inputs, outputs, functions, classes, and data structures are explicitly declared or thoroughly defined *before* use.  
   - Data types, value ranges, initial states, and assumptions must be either explicitly stated or uniquely and logically inferable within the pseudocode.  
   - Absolutely no unresolved references or reliance on unstated external environment, libraries, or domain knowledge.

2. **Precise and Exhaustive Algorithmic Logic:**  
   - All control flow statements (conditional branches, loops, recursion) cover every possible case, including edge and boundary cases, with clearly defined, finite, and guaranteed termination conditions.  
   - Iteration and indexing schemes must be fully specified, consistent, and error-free, with no implicit or ambiguous bounds.  
   - The sequence of operations, state transitions, and data mutations are completely described—no skipped steps or “assumed” operations.

3. **Deterministic, Unambiguous Outcomes:**  
   - The pseudocode produces exactly one well-defined output for any valid input, matching its specification.  
   - There are no nondeterministic or probabilistic components unless their mechanisms are explicitly described to guarantee reproducible outcomes (e.g., fixed random seed or deterministic processes).

4. **Self-Containment and Independence:**  
   - The pseudocode is wholly self-sufficient as presented, without any hidden dependencies: no unstated external functions, global states, or environmental conditions beyond universal programming concepts.  
   - Any conventional constructs or syntax used must conform to standard, widely accepted interpretations or be fully introduced in the snippet itself.

5. **Explicit Input-Output Contracts:**  
   - All inputs and their types or expected forms are clearly declared and described.  
   - Outputs or return values are explicitly stated in terms of their type, structure, and meaning.

6. **Consistent, Clear, and Standardized Notation:**  
   - Syntax, assignment, data manipulation, operators, naming conventions, and indexing (0-based vs 1-based) are internally consistent and unambiguous.  
   - Notation must allow straightforward interpretation by any skilled reader without requiring external assumptions.

7. **Complete Computational Detail:**  
   - All intermediate calculations, data transformations, helper procedures, and necessary subroutines are fully included and clearly described—no “black-box” operations or hidden logic.  
   - No placeholders, shorthand, or undefined constructs that impede deterministic understanding or execution.

### Instructions for Output Decision:

- Conduct a thorough semantic and structural analysis of the pseudocode against **all** criteria above, ensuring no ambiguity or incompleteness remains that could cause failure in unit testing or execution.  
- For each pseudocode snippet provided as input, output **exactly one line** containing either:  
  - `1` — if the snippet meets every criterion and guarantees reproducibility and correctness, or  
  - `0` — if it fails to meet any criterion or contains any form of uncertainty or dependency.

- The output lines must be in the **exact order** that the pseudocodes are given.  
- Output **nothing else**: no explanations, comments, or formatting—only the digits `1` or `0`, one per line.

This prompt prioritizes **absolute rigor and unambiguous completeness**, eliminating false positives by requiring full self-containment, exhaustive logic coverage, deterministic behavior, and clarity. This approach serves to robustly distinguish reproducible pseudocode from those that might appear correct but harbor implicit gaps or hidden dependencies, thereby maximizing evaluation accuracy and reliability across diverse algorithmic domains.
