Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, determine **strictly and unambiguously** whether it is **fully reproducible**, meaning it contains all necessary information, definitions, and explicit instructions to **pass all valid unit tests** for its specified behavior and inputs.

Your output must be exactly one digit: `1` if **every** aspect of reproducibility detailed below is satisfied, or `0` if **any** aspect fails. Output one line per input snippet, preserving input order, no explanations or extra formatting.

### Reproducibility Verification Checklist

Evaluate the pseudocode exhaustively against **all** the following domains. All must hold to output `1`:

1. **Complete and Explicit Definitions**  
   - Every variable, parameter, constant, function, class, and data structure used is explicitly declared or defined within the pseudocode.  
   - Types, initial values, and valid ranges or domains are clearly stated or inherently unambiguous.  
   - No usage of ambiguous terms, placeholders, or implicit external context.  
   - All helper or nested functions used are fully specified and callable as needed.

2. **Precise and Exhaustive Logic**  
   - Control flow structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) are fully described with all necessary branch conditions and termination guarantees (no infinite loops or missing case logic).  
   - Indexing, iteration bounds, and data accesses are consistent and clearly specified with respect to data sizes/lengths.  
   - Algorithmic steps and operations are stated clearly without reliance on unstated assumptions, approximations, or shortcuts.

3. **Deterministic and Predictable Output**  
   - For every valid input within the described constraints, the pseudocode yields a unique, consistent output.  
   - No ambiguity or non-determinism unless explicitly explained and reproducibly defined (e.g., seeded randomness).

4. **Self-Containment and Standalone Integrity**  
   - The entire solution is self-sufficient: it does not require any external libraries, prior computations, hidden states, or unspecified domain knowledge beyond standard pseudocode conventions.  
   - All aspects necessary for running or reasoning about the code are internal and accessible.

5. **Explicit Input-Output Contract**  
   - Input parameters, their types/structures, and expected output(s) are clearly and explicitly declared.  
   - The return or output statement is unambiguously defined with expected data types and formats matching the declared interface.

6. **Consistent and Correct Syntax and Notation**  
   - Assignment, comparison, indexing, data structure manipulations, and expressions adhere to a coherent and customary pseudocode style.  
   - No conflicting or undefined operators or ambiguous constructs.

7. **Sufficient Detail for Reproduction and Testing**  
   - All intermediate steps, data transformations, and helper computations necessary to reach the final result are explicitly described.  
   - No essential logic is omitted, deferred, or vague such that unit test verification would be impossible.

### Instructions

- Carefully verify **all** criteria above; failure to meet **any** results in output `0`.  
- Output must be exactly `1` or `0` per pseudocode snippet, on its own line.  
- Do **not** output any other text, commentary, or explanation.  
- Outputs must be in the same order as inputs.  
- Assume standard pseudocode conventions unless explicitly overridden.
