Given a pseudocode describing any algorithm or function, evaluate whether it is **strictly reproducible**—meaning it can be executed as is to deterministically and unambiguously **pass all valid unit tests** aligned with its declared functionality. Your output for each pseudocode must be exactly `1` if and only if it meets **all** of the following enhanced criteria, otherwise output `0`. Produce no other text or formatting, and maintain output order synchronously with inputs.

### Strict Reproducibility Evaluation Criteria

1. **Complete and Precise Definition of All Entities:**  
   - Every variable, parameter, constant, data structure, class, and helper function is explicitly declared or defined with no undefined references.  
   - Types, initial values, valid ranges, and intended semantics are either explicitly stated or unambiguously inferable by conventional programming/pseudocode standards.  
   - No placeholders, omissions, or implicit reliance on unstated external contexts.

2. **Comprehensive and Deterministic Control Flow:**  
   - Every control flow element (loops, recursion, conditionals, branching) has clearly defined entry, exit, and termination conditions, covering all logical cases and edge cases.  
   - There are no potential infinite loops or indefinite recursion without base cases explicitly given.  
   - Branching and decisions leave no ambiguity or incomplete coverage of input domains; all possible scenarios and exceptional cases are accounted for.

3. **Explicit and Fully Defined Data Access and Indexing:**  
   - All indexing (array, list, tuple, map) is accompanied by explicit boundary checks or clear domain restrictions to prevent out-of-range errors.  
   - Any data manipulations, especially insertions, removals, updates, and iterations, specify exact positions and effects without ambiguity.

4. **Self-Contained Algorithmic Detail Adequacy:**  
   - The pseudocode fully specifies all steps necessary to compute the output for any valid input.  
   - All intermediate computations, data transformations, state updates, and aggregations that lead to the final output are completely detailed with no dependence on omitted or black-box logic.  
   - No crucial operations are described vaguely or delegated outside the given pseudocode.

5. **Deterministic Functional Behavior:**  
   - For any valid input, running the pseudocode will yield a single, consistent output, free from non-deterministic or probabilistic behavior unless such behavior is explicitly and reproducibly defined (e.g., fixed random seeds).  
   - No ambiguous side effects or concurrency-induced race conditions are implied or left undefined.

6. **Clear and Complete Interface Declaration:**  
   - Input parameters and function/class signatures explicitly state the input types and expected formats.  
   - The expected output type and structure are clearly stated or deducible without guesswork.  
   - The scope and usage of inputs/outputs are fully defined.

7. **Consistent, Conventional, and Unambiguous Notation:**  
   - The pseudocode uses consistent and standard conventions for assignments, logical and arithmetic operations, data structures, and syntax.  
   - No conflicting or mixed syntactic styles that could confuse interpretation exist.  
   - Any unconventional notation is explicitly defined within the pseudocode.

8. **Explicit Handling of Errors and Edge Cases:**  
   - The pseudocode explicitly addresses error or boundary scenarios such as empty inputs, invalid parameters, singular elements, maximum or minimum values, etc.  
   - No implicit assumptions are made about input constraints other than those stated.

9. **Free from Hidden Dependencies:**  
   - No references to external libraries, implicit environmental states, global variables, or background knowledge beyond common algorithmic and programming principles customary in pseudocode.

### Output Formatting Instructions

- For each input pseudocode snippet, output exactly one line with a single character:  
  - `1` if **all** the above criteria are strictly met and the pseudocode is reproducible.  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- The outputs must strictly correspond in order to the inputs provided.  
- Do **not** output explanations, intermediate results, or any extra characters.

This rigorous evaluation framework focuses on eliminating false positives by demanding complete, explicit, and unambiguous descriptions, ensuring the pseudocode’s immediate executability and full correctness to pass all unit tests reliably in any context. Use this as your definitive checklist to assess reproducibility consistently and accurately.
