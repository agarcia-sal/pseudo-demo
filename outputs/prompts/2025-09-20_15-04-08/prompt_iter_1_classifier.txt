Given the following pseudocode of an algorithm or function, determine whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”that is, whether it includes all necessary steps, definitions, and logic to pass all relevant unit tests unambiguously and correctly. Assess clarity, completeness, determinism, absence of undefined variables, and logical coherence without requiring external information.  

Output **1** if it is reproducible; otherwise, output **0**. Output nothing else.
