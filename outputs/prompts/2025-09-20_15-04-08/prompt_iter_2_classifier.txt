Given the pseudocode for an algorithm or function, determine if it is fully reproducible—i.e., whether it contains all required components and precise logic to pass all possible unit tests relevant to the described functionality, without ambiguity, incompleteness, or dependency on external definitions.

To decide, thoroughly evaluate the pseudocode on these criteria:

1. **Completeness:** All variables and data structures used are clearly defined and initialized before use; all control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion) cover necessary cases; all subroutines and functions called are either defined or standard.

2. **Determinism and Clarity:** The pseudocode’s operations produce predictable, unambiguous outputs for any valid input; no random or underspecified behavior; indexing and ranges are clearly described and consistent.

3. **Logical coherence:** The steps logically progress toward the intended outcome, not contradictory or self-contradictory; no unreachable or infinite loops without exit; data updates are consistent.

4. **Sufficiency for testing:** The pseudocode contains all logic needed to reproduce the expected outputs given inputs; no missing key computational steps or results aggregation that tests would require.

5. **Self-containment:** The code neither requires nor assumes unstated external information or context.

**Instruction:** After reading the provided pseudocode, output **1** if it meets all above criteria and can be considered reproducible (able to pass all unit tests on purpose), otherwise output **0**.

Output exactly one line per input pseudocode, strictly **1** or **0** with no additional text, formatting, or explanation. The order of outputs must correspond exactly to the input order.
