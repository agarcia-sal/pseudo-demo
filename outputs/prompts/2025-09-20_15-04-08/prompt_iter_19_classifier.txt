Given a pseudocode snippet describing any algorithm or function, **determine with absolute certainty whether the pseudocode is fully reproducibleâ€”that is, it is precise, complete, self-contained, and unambiguous so that it would reliably and deterministically pass all valid unit tests for the specified behavior.**

**Your output must be exactly one digit per input pseudocode snippet:**  
- Output `1` if and only if **every reproducibility condition below is strictly met**; otherwise, output `0`.  
- Output no additional text, explanations, or formatting. Preserve the input order in outputs.

### Comprehensive Reproducibility Verification Requirements:

1. **Complete and Explicit Declarations:**  
   - All variables, inputs, constants, data structures, helper functions, and classes used must be clearly declared or defined _before_ first use.  
   - Data types, valid ranges, initial states, or value domains must be explicit or unambiguously inferable without guesswork.  
   - No usage of unspecified external entities, symbols, or dynamic/invisible contexts.

2. **Exhaustive and Deterministic Control Flow:**  
   - Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) must cover all cases with no dangling branches or undefined conditions.  
   - Loop termination conditions must be finite, well-defined, and free of ambiguity or infinite looping risk.  
   - Logical branching and flow sequencing must be fully and precisely described, without skipping steps or relying on intuition.

3. **Deterministic Outputs and Behavior:**  
   - For any input within declared constraints, the pseudocode deterministically produces exactly one defined output, with no randomness unless described with fully reproducible initialization or state.  
   - Side effects, mutations, or state changes must be predictable and fully characterized.

4. **Unambiguous Computational Detail:**  
   - Every intermediate step, calculation, transformation, and data manipulation necessary to reach the final output is clearly outlined and unambiguous.  
   - No reliance on any unspecified external procedures, libraries, or background knowledge beyond standard, universally accepted pseudocode conventions.

5. **Self-Contained and Context-Free:**  
   - The pseudocode is understandable and executable independently, without hidden assumptions, external dependencies, domain-specific background, or environment-specific context.  
   - Any non-standard pseudocode constructs must be explicitly defined or documented within the snippet.

6. **Consistent and Clear Syntax & Semantics:**  
   - Syntax, operators, indexing, data referencing, and assignment statements must be consistent and follow widely accepted or explicitly declared conventions.  
   - Indexing (0-based or 1-based) and data structure access must be clearly stated and consistent throughout.

7. **Precise Input-Output Interface:**  
   - All input parameters and their types or semantics are clearly declared upfront.  
   - The expected output format, type, structure, or return behavior is explicitly specified.

### Decision Procedure:

- Conduct a **deep semantic and structural analysis** against all the criteria above to judge reproducibility.  
- Return `1` only if the pseudocode fully satisfies all reproducibility conditions; otherwise `0`.  
- The output sequence must exactly match the order of the pseudocode snippets received.  
- Output strictly numeric digits `0` or `1` only, nothing else.

This prompt enforces a **gold-standard reproducibility test** that blends rigorous completeness, clarity, determinism, and self-containment checks to maximize accurate discrimination between reproducible and non-reproducible pseudocode across any domain or problem.
