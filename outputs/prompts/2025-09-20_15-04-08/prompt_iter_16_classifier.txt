Given an arbitrary pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm, function, or class method, **determine, with rigorous certainty, whether this pseudocode is fully reproducible** — i.e., sufficiently explicit, precise, complete, and self-contained so that it can **unambiguously and deterministically pass all correct unit tests covering the declared functionality**.

---

### Output Requirement:
- Output exactly one line per input pseudocode snippet,
- Each line must contain a single digit:  
  - `1` if the pseudocode meets **all** criteria for reproducibility below,  
  - otherwise `0`.
- Retain the exact order of input pseudocode snippets in your output.
- Output nothing else — no explanations, comments, annotations, or extra formatting.

---

### Strict Criteria for Reproducibility:

**1. Complete Declaration and Definitions:**  
- Every variable, constant, parameter, data structure, helper function, class, and type used is either explicitly declared or fully defined **prior** to any usage.  
- Data types or clear domain ranges for variables and inputs are either stated or are logically unique and inferable.  
- No undefined or unresolved references, and no reliance on external state or unstated environmental dependencies.

**2. Fully Specified, Unambiguous Control Flow:**  
- All conditional branches, loops, recursion, and control structures are completely specified covering all edge cases, with guaranteed termination and no infinite or non-progressing loops.  
- Indexing conventions (0-based or 1-based), loop boundaries, and iteration directions are explicit or standard and consistently applied.  
- The exact sequence of operations is explicit; there are no omitted steps, ambiguous shortcuts, or underspecified logic.

**3. Deterministic, Well-Defined Outputs:**  
- For any valid inputs as declared, the pseudocode produces exactly one unique, clear output value or state.  
- No implicit randomness or external nondeterminism unless explicitly defined with a reproducible mechanism.

**4. Self-Containment and No External Dependencies:**  
- The pseudocode is a standalone unit, requiring no hidden state, implicit initialization, proprietary libraries, or domain-specific assumptions beyond universally understood programming constructs.  
- Any conventional syntax, functions, or operations follow widely accepted pseudocode conventions or are fully explained within the snippet.

**5. Explicit Input and Output Specifications:**  
- Input parameters and their types or semantics are clearly described at the start.  
- The expected output or return value, including its type and structure, is explicitly stated.

**6. Exhaustive Intermediate Computations:**  
- All intermediate steps and data transformations required to produce the final result are presented.  
- No logic is deferred to unspecified external calls, hidden helper functions, or black-box methods.

**7. Consistent and Clear Syntax and Notation:**  
- The pseudocode syntax is internally consistent, unambiguous, and interpretable without confusion or contradiction.  
- Operators, assignments, tuple/list indexing, and data structure manipulations are coherent and standard or fully defined.  
- Use of indexing or element access follows consistent convention throughout.

---

### Evaluation Instructions:

- Perform a **deep semantic, syntactic, and logical analysis** on the submitted pseudocode according to all criteria above.  
- Output `1` if and only if **all** reproducibility criteria are met; else output `0`.  
- Ensure your output lines **exactly match the order of input pseudocode snippets**.

This approach enforces the highest reproducibility standard as a strict binary predicate, prioritizing clarity, completeness, and determinism to maximize correct identification of truly testable and executable pseudocode snippets with zero tolerance for underspecification or ambiguity.
