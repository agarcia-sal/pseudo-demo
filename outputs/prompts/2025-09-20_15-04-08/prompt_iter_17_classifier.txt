Given a pseudocode snippet describing a computational algorithm or function, **determine with certainty whether it is fully reproducible**. "Fully reproducible" means the pseudocode is **explicitly precise, complete, and self-contained, without ambiguity or missing information, such that it will reliably and deterministically pass all valid unit tests for its declared functionality.**  

Your output must be exactly `1` if and only if the pseudocode strictly satisfies *all* of the following enhanced reproducibility conditions; otherwise, output `0`.

### Enhanced Comprehensive Reproducibility Criteria:

1. **Explicit Declarations and Unambiguous Naming:**  
   - All variables, constants, data structures, helper functions, and classes are **explicitly declared or defined before use** with clear, non-conflicting names.  
   - Parameter types, initial values, and valid input domains or constraints are either explicitly stated or unambiguously inferable from context.  
   - No external or undefined references, no reliance on unspecified environmental or runtime states.  
   - Distinguish clearly function boundaries, call signatures, and return types.

2. **Complete, Exhaustive, and Structured Logic:**  
   - Control flows (conditions, loops, recursion) explicitly and exhaustively cover all possible input and edge cases with clearly defined and finite termination conditions.  
   - Indexing, iteration ranges, and boundary checks are fully detailed and consistently handled, ensuring no out-of-bound or undefined behaviors.  
   - No gaps or hidden assumptions in transformations, updates, or branching logic; all state changes are clearly specified in a logically ordered manner.

3. **Deterministic and Well-defined Output Behavior:**  
   - For every valid input within the declared constraints, the pseudocode produces exactly one deterministic output or set of outputs consistent with its specification.  
   - Any use of randomness or probabilistic aspects must be explicitly described to be reproducible (e.g., seeded random generation or deterministic simulation).  
   - Output formats, types, and side effects (if any) must be precisely declared.

4. **Full Computational Transparency and Traceability:**  
   - Every computational step including intermediate calculations, state modifications, data transformations, and algorithmic details are fully and explicitly shown.  
   - No reliance on unspecified external libraries, APIs, or black-box procedures—if invoked, their internal logic or behavior must be detailed or defined.  
   - The pseudocode should enable reconstruction of the exact execution process from start to finish.

5. **Strict Self-Containment and Context Independence:**  
   - The snippet must be meaningfully standalone and interpretable without requiring external context, prior background knowledge beyond common programming constructs, or domain-specific assumptions.  
   - Standard pseudocode conventions used should follow widely accepted norms or be explicitly explained.  
   - No implicit dependencies on hidden states or runtime environments.

6. **Consistent, Clear, and Unambiguous Syntax and Notation:**  
   - Syntax, operators, data structure usage, and control flow statements are consistent within the snippet with no contradictions or confusing notations.  
   - Indexing schemes (0-based or 1-based), tuple/list element references, and data type operations strictly follow stated conventions or broadly accepted norms.  
   - Variable reuse or shadowing, if any, must be clearly scoped and non-ambiguous.

7. **Unambiguous Input-Output Interface Specification:**  
   - Input parameters, including types and semantic descriptions, are clearly and exhaustively delineated.  
   - The output is explicitly defined in terms of type, structure, and intended meaning or effect.  
   - Any side effects or state changes visible outside the function/module are clearly declared.

8. **Semantic Integrity and Logical Soundness:**  
   - The pseudocode’s logic aligns correctly with its purported functionality; no logical contradictions, circular dependencies without base cases, or flaws preventing successful completion.  
   - Variable values and states evolve consistently through the computation without impossible or undefined scenarios.

### Decision Instructions:

- Perform an in-depth semantic, syntactic, and logical analysis respecting all the above criteria.  
- Your output for **each** pseudocode snippet must be exactly one line containing either:  
  - `1` — if it **fully qualifies as reproducible**, i.e., guaranteed to deterministically pass all valid unit tests based solely on the provided pseudocode;  
  - `0` — if it fails **any** of the above criteria.

- Preserve the input order: outputs correspond 1-to-1 in order to the input pseudocode snippets.  
- Output **only** the digits `0` or `1` on separate lines, nothing else. No explanations, no formatting, no commentary.

This prompt upgrades accuracy by demanding an exacting, holistic evaluation of reproducibility—covering explicit detail, semantic correctness, self-containment, and clarity—while disallowing all ambiguity or external dependencies. It balances precision with interpretability to maximize reliable detection of fully reproducible pseudocode across arbitrary domains and complexities, minimizing false positives and negatives.
