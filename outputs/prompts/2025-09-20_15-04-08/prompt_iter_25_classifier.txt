Given a pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, determine with **maximal precision and confidence** if it is fully **reproducible**—meaning that it is sufficiently explicit, unambiguous, complete, self-contained, and deterministic such that **it can reliably pass all valid unit tests for its stated functionality without any external assumptions or interpretation.**

You must produce exactly one output (per snippet) on a single line:  
- Output `1` if the pseudocode meets **all** the rigorous criteria listed below (i.e., is reproducible).  
- Output `0` otherwise.

**No explanations, no annotations, no formatting — only the digit `0` or `1` per input pseudocode snippet, strictly preserving the input order.**

### Enhanced Reproducibility Assessment Criteria

1. **Explicit Declarations and Well-Defined Data:**  
   - Every variable, constant, input, output, data structure, auxiliary function, and class is declared or clearly defined **before use**.  
   - Data types, range constraints, initialization values, and domain assumptions are explicitly stated or logically deducible **without ambiguity**.  
   - No references to undefined or external entities, implicit globals, or assumed runtime contexts.

2. **Complete and Exhaustive Control Flow:**  
   - The pseudocode defines all control paths for every possible input or state, including all branches, loops, recursion, and termination conditions.  
   - Loop exit conditions and recursive base cases are definite, ensuring no infinite or indeterminate execution.  
   - Boundary conditions (e.g., array indices, edge cases) and iteration details are precise and consistent.

3. **Deterministic and Well-Defined Outputs:**  
   - For every valid input within stated or inferable constraints, the pseudocode yields exactly one predictable output or side effect.  
   - Any randomness or state-dependent behavior must be explicitly described so that it can be exactly reproduced.  
   - No hidden nondeterminism or underspecified behavior.

4. **Complete Computational Steps Without Omission:**  
   - All operations, intermediate computations, data transformations, and state modifications crucial to producing the output are specified in full.  
   - No placeholders, ambiguous “magic” functions, or calls to unspecified external libraries or systems.

5. **Self-Containment and Context Independence:**  
   - The pseudocode stands alone without needing external context, implicit assumptions, or domain knowledge beyond standard programming abstractions.  
   - Familiar pseudocode constructs must be used according to their widely accepted meanings or be explicitly introduced.

6. **Consistent, Unambiguous, and Well-Formed Syntax:**  
   - All syntax, operators, indexing rules (e.g., zero- vs one-based), and data access expressions are consistently and precisely applied.  
   - No contradictory or confusing notation, ambiguous references, or otherwise unclear expressions.

7. **Explicit and Precise Input-Output Contract:**  
   - Inputs (parameters, arguments) are fully declared with meaningful description of types and constraints.  
   - Outputs (return values or side effects) are clearly specified in terms of type, structure, and exact meaning.

### Instructions for Final Decision:

- Analyze the pseudocode deeply on both semantic and structural levels against **every criterion above**.  
- Return **only a single digit:**  
  - `1` if **all** criteria pass — i.e., the pseudocode is reproducible and expected to pass all valid unit tests reliably.  
  - Otherwise, `0`.

- Maintain the **input order** of pseudocode snippets in your output lines.  
- Output exactly one line per input snippet with **nothing else**.

This improved prompt enforces a higher standard of clarity, precision, and completeness, explicitly demanding a fully self-contained, unambiguous, and deterministic definition that leaves no room for interpretation, thereby maximizing accuracy and robustness in reproducibility classification across any arbitrary pseudocode input.
