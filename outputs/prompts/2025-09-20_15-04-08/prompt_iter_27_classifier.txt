Given any pseudocode snippet describing an algorithm or function, **determine with absolute certainty whether it is fully reproducible**, meaning it is sufficiently explicit, complete, consistent, and self-contained to **unambiguously and deterministically pass all valid unit tests** for the specified functionality.

Output exactly `1` if and only if **all** of the following conditions are met; otherwise, output `0`.

### Enhanced Reproducibility Criteria:

1. **Explicit and Complete Declarations**  
   - All variables, parameters, constants, data structures, functions, and classes used are explicitly declared or fully defined before use.  
   - Data types, initialization values, and value constraints or domains are clearly specified or logically inferable without ambiguity.  
   - No unresolved or implicit external dependencies (no hidden global state, external libraries, or unstated environmental assumptions).

2. **Fully Deterministic and Exhaustive Logic**  
   - All control paths (branches, loops, recursion) are exhaustively and precisely described, including explicit and finite loop termination conditions.  
   - Logic covers all edge and boundary cases, including empty inputs, extremes, and special values, ensuring no undefined or indeterminate behavior.  
   - No nondeterminism or randomness unless explicitly defined and reproducible within the pseudocode itself.

3. **Precise and Consistent State and Data Manipulation**  
   - All state changes, computations, and intermediate steps are fully specified without omission, including exact updates of variables and data structures.  
   - Indexing schemes, offsets, and element references are precisely defined and uniformly applied throughout.

4. **Complete Input and Output Specification**  
   - Inputs are described with explicit naming, types, and valid input domains or constraints.  
   - Outputs are clearly defined in terms of format, type, and expected effects (return values or side effects).

5. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The snippet is fully self-contained with no reliance on hidden context, unstated preprocessing/postprocessing, or external system features beyond widely accepted programming concepts.  
   - Any commonly used constructs or idioms follow standard usage or are explicitly introduced and defined.

6. **Consistent, Unambiguous Notation and Syntax**  
   - The pseudocode syntax and semantics are consistent, well-formed, and interpretable without contradictions or confusing shorthand.  
   - Use of indexing (0-based or 1-based), tuple/list element references, and operators is consistent and clearly stated or conventionally understood.

7. **Semantic Clarity and Logical Cohesion**  
   - Each part of the pseudocode contributes clearly and meaningfully toward the overall functionality; no unexplained shortcuts, assumptions, or gaps in reasoning.  
   - Helper functions or nested procedures are fully defined and integrated without external dependencies.

### Output Instructions

- Analyze the pseudocode deeply, applying the above criteria to determine reproducibility.  
- Output exactly one line per pseudocode snippet, containing only:  
  - `1` if the pseudocode fully meets all reproducibility criteria and can be expected to pass all valid unit tests reliably, or  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- Preserve the order of outputs exactly as the order in which pseudocodes are provided.  
- Do not output explanations, comments, formatting, or anything else beyond `0` or `1`.

This refined standard emphasizes **explicitness, determinism, thoroughness, and self-containment** while integrating explicit requirements for edge-case coverage, unambiguous indexing, and semantic clarityâ€”reducing false negatives on correct pseudocode and false positives on incomplete or ambiguous ones, thereby improving evaluation accuracy across diverse algorithms and problem domains.
