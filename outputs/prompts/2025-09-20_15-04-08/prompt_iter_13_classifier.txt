Given any pseudocode describing an algorithm or function, **determine with absolute certainty whether it is reproducible**, i.e., fully precise, complete, self-contained, and unambiguous so that it can reliably and deterministically **pass all valid unit tests for its declared behavior** in any standard programming environment.

---

### Output Specification:

- Output exactly one line per given pseudocode snippet, each line containing **either** `1` **or** `0` **only**.  
- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode satisfies **all** reproducibility requirements below; otherwise output `0`.  
- The order of output lines must strictly correspond to the input order of pseudocode snippets.  
- Output nothing else â€” no extra explanation, comments, or formatting.

---

### Comprehensive Reproducibility Criteria:

1. **Explicit and Complete Declarations:**  
   - All variables, parameters, constants, data structures, helper functions, and classes are declared or defined **before use**.  
   - Types, valid input ranges or constraints, initial values, and semantics are clearly specified or unambiguously inferable.  
   - No undefined identifiers or references to external, dynamic, or implicit context.

2. **Fully Deterministic and Well-Defined Behavior:**  
   - For every valid input within stated constraints, the pseudocode produces exactly one unambiguous output.  
   - No nondeterminism except when explicitly defined with deterministic randomness or exact state initialization.  
   - All logical branches, loops, and recursion explicitly cover all cases with clear termination, preventing infinite or undefined execution.

3. **Self-Containment and No Hidden Dependencies:**  
   - The pseudocode stands entirely on its own without relying on unstated external libraries, background knowledge, hidden state, or domain-specific assumptions beyond common programming concepts.  
   - Any used pseudocode syntax and constructs are either standard or explicitly defined within the snippet.

4. **Complete Algorithmic Description:**  
   - All internal computations, state modifications, and intermediate steps necessary to reach the final output are fully specified.  
   - No reliance on omitted or implicit procedures, external calls, or unspecified operations.

5. **Clear and Consistent Notation and Semantics:**  
   - Syntax, operators, control structures, indexing conventions (0-based or 1-based), and data accesses are consistently and unambiguously specified and used.  
   - Input and output formats are explicitly stated and coherent throughout.

6. **Precise Input-Output Contract:**  
   - Input parameters and their types/ranges are clearly described or inferable.  
   - The output, including return values or side effects, is unambiguously defined in terms of type, structure, and meaning.

### Evaluation Instructions:

- Conduct a strict semantic and structural analysis of the pseudocode against all criteria above.  
- Only output `1` if the pseudocode is fully reproducible by the above definition and can pass **all** legitimate unit tests.  
- Otherwise, output `0`.

This prompt enforces an authoritative, high-precision standard for reproducibility that balances explicit detail, total self-containment, and unambiguous determinism to maximize true-positive accuracy and minimize false assessments across varied algorithms and problem domains.
