Translate the given code into clear, compact pseudocode that faithfully preserves the original code’s structure and control flow. Include all control statements (if, else, loops), variable assignments, function calls, and expressions uniformly and simply, using natural language augmented with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Strive for a high-level but precise description that is easy to read and understand, favoring one-line statements wherever possible. It is acceptable to omit less critical details to keep the pseudocode concise. Do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or identification of purpose—output only the numbered pseudocode steps. Format your output exactly as follows:

1. variable ← initial_value  
2. if condition: do_action  
3. for var from start to end: do_action  

Use meaningful but brief identifiers and maintain consistent indentation to show nested blocks. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Produce just the pseudocode. Your response must complete within 5 seconds, so optimize for clarity and brevity while preserving the logical flow and key operations.
