Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that strictly retains its original structure and logical flow, covering all control statements (if, else if, else, switch/case), loops (for, while), variable assignments, and function calls uniformly. Use mostly natural language phrasing combined with simple symbolic notation for expressions and operations. Prioritize high-level, compact one-liners; omit non-critical details if it reduces length without losing essential logic. Use meaningful but short variable and function names and consistent indentation to indicate nesting. Number each pseudocode step sequentially starting at 1, without any extra formatting, comments, or explanations. The output must contain only the pseudocode in this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if condition: callFunction()  
4. for i from start to end: update i  

Avoid separator lines, titles, or summaries. Balance brevity with fidelity to the code’s logic and structure. Return the output swiftly within 5 seconds.
