Translate the given code into concise, easy-to-read pseudocode using natural language, compact and high-level expressions. Use symbolic representations and abbreviations where possible, prefer one-line statements, and omit comments, explanations, purpose, summary, or overview. The pseudocode should focus only on the steps and structure, formatted like:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity with minimal lines, even if some details are omitted, and produce only the pseudocode. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for best results within this limit.
