Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that preserves its original structure and all control flows (if, else, switch, while, for), variable assignments, function calls, and expressions. Use natural language combined with simple symbolic notation and common abbreviations to make the pseudocode easily readable and compact. Represent control blocks with consistent indentation and express most statements as brief one-liners; it is acceptable to omit less critical details or explicit types if it helps reduce verbosity. Always preserve the logical flow and key operations but favor brevity over exhaustive detail.

Do not add explanations, comments, summaries, or purpose statements—output only the pseudocode steps, numbered starting at 1, following these example styles:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if cond: call f(args) else: x ← y + 1  
4. for i from 0 to n-1: process A[i]  

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Output just the pseudocode text. Prioritize completing within 5 seconds by keeping output compact yet structurally faithful.
