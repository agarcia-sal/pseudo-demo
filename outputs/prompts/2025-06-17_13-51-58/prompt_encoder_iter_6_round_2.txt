Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that fully preserves the original structure and all control flow elements (if, else, while, for, switch), variable assignments, function calls, and loops. Use simple, consistent natural language phrasing with symbolic notation and common concise abbreviations. Produce compact, high-level pseudocode that favors readable one-liners and uniform indentation reflecting nested scopes. It is acceptable to omit some details if it significantly reduces line count while retaining the main logic and step order.  
Do not add explanations, comments, summaries, or any descriptions—output only the pseudocode statements numbered sequentially from 1 with this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. if condition: action  
3. for i from start to end: action  
4. call func(args)  

Use minimal but meaningful variable names and expressive one-line statements wherever possible. Avoid separators, extra blank lines, or formatting beyond indentation. Prioritize clarity and brevity to ensure output completes within 5 seconds while fully reflecting key operations and control flow. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps, nothing else.
