Translate the given code into concise, compact pseudocode that strictly preserves its original structure and all key logic: control flows (if, else if, else, while, for, switch/case), variable assignments, loops, function calls, and expressions. Use uniform, simple symbolic notation and natural language phrasing, favoring brief, high-level one-liners wherever possible. It’s acceptable to omit some details to keep pseudocode short and clear, but never omit essential control flow or critical operations. Use meaningful, short variable and function names, consistent indentation to denote nested blocks, and standard conventions for loops and conditionals. Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or meta-text—output only the pseudocode steps numbered sequentially from 1, following this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if condition: doAction()  
4. for i from start to end: update i

Avoid any separator lines or extra formatting. Do not describe the code’s purpose or add clarification—only the pseudocode itself. Optimize for readability, brevity, and faithful logical representation. Complete the output promptly within 5 seconds.
