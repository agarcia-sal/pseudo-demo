Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and well-structured Python code.  
- Enclose the entire code in one Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.  
- Your code must read all inputs using `input()` calls **without any prompt strings**.  
- Implement all details precisely as specified in the pseudocode logic.  
- Prioritize correctness, readability, and efficiency, ensuring your code runs within 5 seconds for typical inputs.  
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries to optimize performance.  
- Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or output other than the required code inside the code block.  
- Avoid adding separator lines or extraneous formatting.
