Translate the given code into concise, readable pseudocode that strictly preserves its original structure and core logic, including all control flow statements (if, else, while, for, switch), variable assignments, function calls, and loops. Express these clearly but compactly, using natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Favor high-level one-liners without superfluous detail; it is acceptable to omit some non-critical specifics if it reduces line count and improves clarity. Use meaningful yet brief variable and function names, consistent indentation to show nested blocks, and avoid explanations, comments, or summaries. Produce numbered steps starting from 1 in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if condition: action  
4. for i from start to end: action  
5. call function(args)  

Do not include separator lines, extraneous formatting, or descriptions—output only the pseudocode. Prioritize brevity, clarity, and faithful logical flow. The output should complete within 5 seconds.  

Example style:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
