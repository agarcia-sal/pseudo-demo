Translate the input code into concise, high-level pseudocode that strictly preserves its original structure and all key elements—variable declarations and assignments, control flows (if, else if, else, while, for, switch/case), function calls, and expressions—using uniform, simple, and natural language phrasing combined with standard symbolic notation and widely accepted abbreviations. Prioritize clear and easy-to-read one-line statements; use indentation to show nesting. It is acceptable to omit complex or less critical details if doing so significantly shortens the pseudocode while maintaining logical correctness. Do not add any explanations, commentary, summaries, or descriptions of purpose—output only the numbered pseudocode steps, beginning at 1, following this minimal format style:

1. let x ← 0  
2. if condition: action  
3. for i from 0 to n-1: action  
4. call func(args)  
5. else if condition: action  

Do not include separator lines, extra formatting, or text besides the pseudocode. Use meaningful but brief identifiers and consistent indentation to reflect code blocks. Your output must be limited to the pseudocode only and complete within 5 seconds, balancing brevity, clarity, and full logical flow preservation.
