Translate the given code into clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode that faithfully preserves its original structure and all control flow constructs (if, else, while, for, switch/case), variable assignments, function calls, and loops. Use natural language combined with simple symbolic notation and common abbreviations to express logic uniformly and readably. Favor compact one-line statements where possible, but keep nested blocks indented consistently to reflect hierarchy. It is acceptable to omit lower-level details if doing so reduces verbosity without breaking logical flow or losing key operations. Use meaningful yet succinct variable and function names.  
Do not add explanations, comments, summaries, or code purpose descriptions; output only the numbered pseudocode steps starting from 1. Follow this style and formatting strictly:  

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if condition: action  
4. for i from 0 to n-1: action  
5. call function(args)  

Do NOT include separator lines, extra formatting, or text outside the numbered pseudocode steps. Output ONLY the pseudocode, optimizing for readability, brevity, and faithful structure preservation. Complete within 5 seconds.
