Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that strictly preserves the original control flow structures (if, else, else if, while, for, switch/case), assignments, function calls, and key expressions. Use mostly natural language with simple symbolic notation and common abbreviations, aiming for a compact, high-level style that favors single-line statements and omits less critical details to reduce length. Maintain consistent indentation to reflect nested blocks and retain meaningful but brief variable and function names. Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or purpose—output only the numbered pseudocode steps, starting at 1, in this format:  

1. let x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if condition: action  
4. for i from 0 to n-1: action  
5. call func(args)  

Avoid separator lines, extra formatting, or any output except the pseudocode itself. Prioritize clarity and brevity over completeness when needed to ensure the output is concise and the logical flow is preserved. The output must finish within 5 seconds.
