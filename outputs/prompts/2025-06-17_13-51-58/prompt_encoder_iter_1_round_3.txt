Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that preserves the original code’s structure and all control flow elements (if, else, while, for, switch), variable assignments, function calls, and expressions. Express these uniformly and simply using natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Your pseudocode should be compact and high-level, favoring readable one-liners and omitting less critical details when necessary to reduce line count. Use meaningful but brief identifiers and consistent indentation for nested blocks to reflect structure. Do not add any explanations, comments, summaries, or identification of the code’s purpose—output only the numbered pseudocode steps, starting at 1, strictly following this format:

1. variable ← initial_value  
2. if condition: action  
3. for var from start to end: action  
4. call function(args)  

Avoid separator lines or additional formatting; produce just the pseudocode. The output must complete within 5 seconds, so prioritize brevity and clarity while fully preserving logical flow and key operations.
