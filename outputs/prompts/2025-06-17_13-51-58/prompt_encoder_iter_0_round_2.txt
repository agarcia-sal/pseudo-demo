Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that fully preserves the original structure and control flow, including all control statements (if, else, while, for), variable assignments, function calls, and expressions. Express operations uniformly using natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations, favoring a high-level, compact style. Prioritize one-line statements and omit less critical details if needed to reduce length, while maintaining logical correctness. Use meaningful but brief identifiers and consistent indentation to mark nested blocks. Do not add comments, explanations, summaries, or purpose statements—output only numbered pseudocode steps. Format exactly as shown:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if condition: callFunc() else: x ← 1  
4. for i from 0 to n-1: process(i)

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Output only the pseudocode within 5 seconds, optimizing for brevity and readability without losing essential logic.
