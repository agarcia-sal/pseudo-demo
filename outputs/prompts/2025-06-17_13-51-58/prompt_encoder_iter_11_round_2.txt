Translate the input code into concise, high-level pseudocode that faithfully preserves the original structure, including all control flow constructs (if/else, while, for, switch/case), variable assignments, function calls, and loops. Use clear natural language with symbolic notation and common programming abbreviations, emphasizing readability and compactness. Prefer one-line statements where possible, but maintain consistent indentation to show nested blocks clearly. It is acceptable to omit less essential low-level details if this improves brevity and clarity. Do not include comments, explanations, purpose descriptions, or any extra formatting—output strictly numbered pseudocode steps starting at 1, following this style exactly:

1. let x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if condition: do action  
4. for i from 0 to n-1: call function(i)  

Avoid separator lines or other decorations. Output only the pseudocode and nothing else. Prioritize conciseness and logical flow preservation, completing within 5 seconds.
