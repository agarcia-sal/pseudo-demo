Given a problem description, generate concise, high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand. Use natural language mixed with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Write pseudocode without any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations. Prefer one-liners and compact statements. Follow this numbering format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode reflects the core logic clearly and efficiently. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim for the best possible output within this limit.
