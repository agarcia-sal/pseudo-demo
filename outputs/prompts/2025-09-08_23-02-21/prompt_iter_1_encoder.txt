Generate concise, easy-to-read, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Present the steps in a numbered list, with one-liners preferred. Avoid providing any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Make sure the pseudocode is clear and understandable but compact, without unnecessary detail or verbosity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; prioritize producing the best possible output within this limit.
