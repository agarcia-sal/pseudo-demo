Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should use natural language, symbolic representations, abbreviations, and a compact high-level style. Use mainly one-liners and prefer clarity without verbose detail. Do not include any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not add notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format strictly, numbering each line:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Your pseudocode must be clear, understandable, and efficient to produce within a 5-second timeout.
