Generate clear, concise pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand, using mostly natural language with symbolic notation, abbreviations, and a compact, high-level style. Produce the pseudocode as numbered one-liner statements whenever possible, minimizing verbosity while preserving clarity. Omit all explanations, summaries, comments, or notes of any kind—output only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use structured constructs like loops, conditionals, assignments, and function calls in a straightforward way. Prefer readable variable names but allow abbreviations and concise expressions. Avoid any separator lines or extra formatting.

Example output style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
