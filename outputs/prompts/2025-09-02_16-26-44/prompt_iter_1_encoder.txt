Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description using natural language mixed with symbolic representations and abbreviations. The pseudocode should be high-level and compact, favoring one-liners and clear control structures. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, or any notes for clarity—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format exactly, with numbered lines, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for understandable pseudocode without comments or explanations. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best possible results within this limit.
