Given the pseudocode below, generate a rewritten version that fulfills all the following criteria: 

- The rewritten pseudocode must preserve **all original logic and functionality exactly**.
- Maintain **the same function names, class names**, and **class hierarchies, including object structures**, without any changes.
- Modify the pseudocodeâ€™s **style, syntax, wording, data structure usage**, **control flow patterns (loops, conditionals)**, and **overall organization** to make it as syntactically and structurally distinct as possible from the original.
- Introduce alternate expressions, employ different but equivalent language and conventions, reorder statements where order does not affect semantics, replace constructs with equivalent ones, and vary formatting, while ensuring the output remains valid pseudocode.
- The output must contain **only the rewritten pseudocode**; do not include explanations, comments, or any text before or after the pseudocode.
