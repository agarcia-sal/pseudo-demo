Given the following pseudocode, rewrite it to produce a version that is as different as possible in style, structure, and expression, while preserving all original functionality. Keep the same function names exactly as in the original code. Maintain the same class names, class hierarchy, and object structures without any changes. Your output should consist solely of the rewritten pseudocode and nothing else.
