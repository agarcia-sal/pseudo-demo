Write pseudocode for the given problem description using the exact class and function names as provided. Keep the original class and object structure intact. The pseudocode must be concise, compact, and high-level, blending clear natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations, favoring one-liners wherever possible.

- Do NOT include any purpose, summary, explanations, comments, or notes.
- Use well-chosen, meaningful variable names from the problem but keep expressions succinct.
- Follow structured control flow with proper indentation.
- Represent assignments with ←, comparisons with standard symbols (=, <, >, ≤, ≥), increments with ++ or +=, decrements with -- or -=.
- Use natural language for control statements (e.g., FOR, WHILE, IF, ELSE, RETURN) clearly and simply.
- Avoid verbose phrasing; keep each line focused solely on a single logical step.
- Use the following format for numbering lines and layout exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. WHILE x < n: x++  

- Do NOT include separator lines, titles, or code fences.
- Output ONLY the pseudocode—no prose or additional text.

Your function has a 5-second timeout; maximize clarity, correctness, and compactness within this limit.
