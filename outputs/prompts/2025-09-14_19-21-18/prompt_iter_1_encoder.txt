Write pseudocode based on the given problem description. Do not include any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not add notes or explanations. Use concise, easy-to-read, and understandable pseudocode with natural language, preferring compact, high-level expressions. Aim for one-liners, use symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate. Follow this format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Keep the pseudocode focused solely on the logic and steps needed to solve the problem, using clear variable naming and structured control flow. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
