Translate the provided pseudocode into complete, syntactically correct, and idiomatic Python code that exactly matches the structure and naming of the pseudocode, following these enhanced requirements to maximize correctness, robustness, and precision:

- Keep all class names, method/function names, parameter names, and signatures **exactly as they appear** in the pseudocode without alteration.
- Maintain **the entire class structure, inheritance, and relationships** as described, including nested classes or functions.
- Translate control flow constructs, expressions, data structures, and operations to correct, clear, and idiomatic Python, preserving semantics exactly.
- Ensure the produced code **handles all reasonable input and edge cases without errors**, including empty inputs, nulls, and boundary conditions implied by the pseudocode.
- Use **only standard Python libraries or well-established third-party packages** if they clearly improve safety, readability, or efficiency, and only when necessary. Justify such use inherently by code clarity and relevance.
- Avoid introducing any behavior, logic, or side effects **not explicitly or implicitly described** in the pseudocode.
- Include helper/internal functions or classes **only if defined in the pseudocode or if absolutely required** to preserve correctness and clarity.
- Favor clear, concise, and Pythonic idioms, while preserving clarity and performance—avoid unnecessary verbosity.
- Do not include any comments, explanations, or introductory text in the output—output _only_ the finished Python code.
- Enclose the code in a single Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ``` exactly, with no additional text or wrappers.
- Preserve function signatures and class names exactly to ensure test harness compatibility, including appropriate imports if pseudocode indicates their need.
