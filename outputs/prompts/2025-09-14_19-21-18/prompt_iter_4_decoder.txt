Translate the following pseudocode into properly structured, clean, and efficient Python code. Your translation must:

- Preserve all class names, method/function names, and signatures exactly as given in the pseudocode.
- Maintain the original class and object hierarchy and relationships.
- Use idiomatic Python syntax and standard libraries; you may incorporate any available Python packages to improve clarity or efficiency but avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Enclose the entire Python code output within triple backticks specifying the language, like so:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

- Ensure the resulting code is logically correct, handles edge cases appropriately, and optimizes for both clarity and performance.
- Your translated functions should be fully functional and ready to run as-is within 5 seconds for typical input sizes.
- Do **not** add extraneous explanation, comments beyond essential clarifications, or additional text outside the Python code block.
- Avoid introducing unrelated helper functions unless they are clearly implied by the pseudocode.
