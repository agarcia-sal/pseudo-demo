Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that strictly:

- Retains all class names, method/function names, parameters, and signatures exactly as presented.
- Preserves the original class structure, inheritance, and object relationships precisely.
- Uses only standard Python libraries or widely available packages when they improve readability or performance, without adding unnecessary dependencies.
- Produces fully functional, ready-to-run code that handles typical edge cases robustly and executes within 5 seconds on standard inputs.
- Does not add or remove any functionality beyond what is implied or explicitly stated in the pseudocode.
- Avoids extraneous explanations or comments except minimal necessary clarifications inside the code.
- Does not introduce helper functions or classes unless clearly indicated or essential for correctness.
- Outputs only the final code enclosed in a Python code block exactly as below:

```python
