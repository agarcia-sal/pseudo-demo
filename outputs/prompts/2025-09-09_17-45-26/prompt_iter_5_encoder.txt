Generate concise, compact pseudocode directly from the given problem description. Keep all original class names, method names, and data structures unchanged. Use clear, natural language in a high-level style with symbolic notation and abbreviations where appropriate. Favor one-line statements without explanations, comments, summaries, or overview text. Format steps as numbered lines as follows:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include separator lines or extra formatting. Produce pseudocode that is easy to read and understand but minimal and precise, consistently reflecting the original code’s structure and naming. Your output should be only the numbered pseudocode lines representing the solution algorithm, respecting a 5-second generation timeout.
