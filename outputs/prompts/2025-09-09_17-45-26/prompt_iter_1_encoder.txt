Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a compact, high-level style with natural language, one-liners, symbolic notation, and abbreviations where suitable. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations. Format steps as numbered lines like:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clear, understandable pseudocode only. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best result within this limit.
