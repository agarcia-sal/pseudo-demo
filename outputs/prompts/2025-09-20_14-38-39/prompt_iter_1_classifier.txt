Analyze the given pseudocode and determine whether it contains all necessary elements—such as initialization, clear logic, proper control flow, and defined inputs/outputs—to guarantee that running this algorithm will consistently produce correct results that pass all unit tests. Output 1 if the pseudocode is reproducible under these criteria; otherwise, output 0. Return only the number 1 or 0, and nothing else.
