Translate the provided pseudocode into a complete, production-quality Python 3 program that:

- Only uses `input()` with no prompts to read input exactly as the pseudocode implies.
- Produces output precisely as specified or implied by the pseudocode, with no extra characters or lines.
- Implements every detail and logical step described or strongly implied, including robust handling of all edge cases and constraints.
- Is efficient enough to run within 5 seconds on typical competitive programming input sizes.
- Uses clean, idiomatic, well-structured, and maintainable Python code.
- May freely import and leverage any **standard or widely-used third-party Python libraries** if they make your solution more concise, clear, or performant.
- Contains only Python code enclosed strictly in a single Python code block exactly in this format:

```python
# your complete Python code here
```

- Includes no explanation, comments only if they clarify complex or non-obvious parts, and no additional text or output outside the code block.

Your final submission must be ready to run without any modifications or external dependencies beyond allowed imports. Optimize for correctness, clarity, and maximal runtime efficiency.
