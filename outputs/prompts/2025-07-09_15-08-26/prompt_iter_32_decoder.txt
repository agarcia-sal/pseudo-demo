You are tasked with translating **any given pseudocode** into a fully functional, efficient, idiomatic Python 3 program that must run within 5 seconds.

Please follow these strict guidelines:

- Produce **only** runnable Python 3 code enclosed inside a single code block exactly as follows:

```python
# your complete Python code here
```

- Use `input()` exclusively for all input reading—**no prompt strings**, no interactive input styles.
- Fully implement **every** step, including any strongly implied logic, edge cases, and constraints described or inherently suggested by the pseudocode.
- Output **only** what the pseudocode specifies—do **not** add extra prints, debug statements, comments (except minimal inline comments where code clarity fundamentally benefits), separators, explanations, or blank lines outside the code block.
- The output code must be immediately runnable and self-contained — no auxiliary files, no modifications, no pre-run setup.
- Prioritize clean, idiomatic, and modern Python 3 practices, leveraging expressive syntax and language features where appropriate.
- To maximize clarity, robustness, and performance, you are encouraged to import and use any relevant **standard libraries or widely-used third-party Python packages** such as `collections`, `heapq`, `math`, `itertools`, `bisect`, `numpy`, or others that improve speed, readability, or succinctness.
- Aim for a well-structured program with proper function decomposition if logical, but keep overall brevity and efficiency in mind.
- The translated code must strictly adhere to the pseudocode semantics and requirements, guaranteeing the same outputs for all valid inputs within the allowed runtime.
- Do **not** include any separator lines, explanations, or metadata in your answer—only the exact Python code as specified above inside the markdown code block.

This enhanced approach emphasizes rigor, idiomatic style, comprehensive correctness, and maximum runtime efficiency—delivered with zero extraneous content—to produce the highest-fidelity pseudocode-to-Python translations within the 5-second limit.
