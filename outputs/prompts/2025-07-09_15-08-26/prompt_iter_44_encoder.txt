Generate clear, concise, and compact pseudocode that directly solves the problem using natural language blended with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Express the logic mostly in one-line instructions combining control flow and actions only when it retains clarity and readability. Use succinct declarations like “let x be integer,” “let A be vector of integers,” direct assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as needed. Number each line starting at 1, followed by a space and the instruction, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, or extraneous formatting—output only the numbered pseudocode lines with no separator lines or notes. Favor natural phrasing that is easy to read yet compact and high-level. When a block structure is required, indent subsequent lines to show hierarchy, but keep it minimal and consistent. Use symbolic and abbreviated forms where they improve brevity without sacrificing understanding. The final output must strictly be numbered pseudocode steps—nothing else.
