Generate concise, compact pseudocode directly reflecting the problem logic without explanations, summaries, or clarifications.  
Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations; prefer one-line instructions combining control flow and actions when clear and terse.  
Number each line incrementally starting at 1, followed by a space and the instruction, e.g.:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid decorative separators or extra formatting. Use clear variable declarations, assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as needed.  
Emphasize readability first—use familiar phrasing and structure—then minimalism.  
Output only the pseudocode steps, no additional text.
