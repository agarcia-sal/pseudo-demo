Generate concise, clear pseudocode directly from the problem description. Use mostly natural language enriched with symbolic notations and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Avoid comments, explanations, summaries, or any notes. Produce only the pseudocode steps, formatted with line numbers followed by a period and a space, then the instruction. Prefer single-line statements when possible, using control structures like loops and conditionals inline. Maintain readable variable names but allow abbreviations and symbolic operators for brevity. Do not use separator lines or extra formatting.

Follow this style exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example output style:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers of size n  
read all n elements into A  
for i from 0 to n-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j from i+1 to n-1  
  if A[min_i] > A[j]: min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
