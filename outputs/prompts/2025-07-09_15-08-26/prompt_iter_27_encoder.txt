Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode that directly implements the problem’s logic using mostly one-line instructions that combine control flow and actions when it keeps the code compact and readable. Use natural language mixed with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations to ensure the pseudocode is easy to read and understand. Number each line starting at 1, followed by a space and the instruction, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Prefer succinct declarations such as "let x be integer," direct assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as needed. Avoid explanations, summaries, comments, clarifications, or decorative formatting. Do not include separator lines or extra text. Use indentation only when necessary to clarify nested blocks. The output must be ONLY the numbered pseudocode lines—no additional text.
