Translate the entire provided pseudocode into a clean, efficient, and fully functional Python 3 program that executes correctly within 5 seconds. Your response must consist **exclusively** of the complete runnable Python code enclosed in a single code block formatted exactly as follows:

```python
# complete Python code here
```

Follow these precise instructions:

- Read **all inputs strictly using** `input()` with no prompt strings, matching the input style implied by the pseudocode.
- Implement **every step and logic explicitly stated or clearly implied** by the pseudocode, including all necessary edge case handling.
- Do **not** include any explanation, comments other than those absolutely necessary to elucidate complex or nontrivial code sections, or any output beyond the specified program output.
- Use idiomatic, readable, and optimized Python 3 code focusing on correctness, minimal runtime overhead, and clarity.
- You may import and use **any standard or widely recognized third-party Python libraries** that can help improve performance, readability, or succinctness, as long as the final code remains self-contained and runnable without modifications.
- The final solution must be standalone: after pasting into a standard Python 3 environment, it should run immediately without errors or unmet dependencies.
- Do **not** include separators, extra blank lines beyond standard formatting, or any text outside the Python code block.

This prompt is designed to maximize precision, robustness, and runtime efficiency while strictly adhering to the pseudocode logic and input/output format.
