Generate clear, concise, and compact pseudocode directly implementing the problem logic in mostly one-line instructions using natural language enriched with standard symbols and common abbreviations. Use succinct declarations like "let x be integer," direct assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as needed, preferring symbolic clarity and brevity while maintaining readability. Number each line starting at 1, followed by a space and the instruction, for example:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid summaries, explanations, notes, comments, or decorative formatting. Do not include separator lines or any text besides the numbered pseudocode instructions. Prefer readable natural phrasing that remains compact and high-level. Aim for standard algorithmic constructs without verbose detail but enough clarity for implementation. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly as specified.
