Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode that directly implements the given problem’s logic using mostly natural language with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Strive for compactness by preferring one-line instructions that combine control flow and actions without sacrificing readability. Use succinct declarations (e.g., "let x be integer," "let A be vector of integers"), direct assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as needed. Number each line starting from 1 with a space after the number, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid summaries, explanations, clarifications, comments, or decorative formatting. Do not include separator lines or notes. The output must be only the numbered pseudocode lines—no additional text. Use indentation only to clarify nested structures but keep the overall output compact and easy to follow. Preserve natural phrasing and logical clarity as priority over extreme minimalism.
