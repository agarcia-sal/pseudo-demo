Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations, be compact and high-level, and avoid comments, explanations, purpose statements, or summaries. Prefer one-liners where possible. Format each line with a step number, a space, and the instruction, for example:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second timeout.
