Translate the provided pseudocode into a complete, self-contained, and production-quality Python 3 program that executes correctly, efficiently, and within 5 seconds.  
Your entire output must be a single Python code block formatted exactly as follows (no extra text outside):  

```python
# Complete runnable Python code here
```

Adhere strictly to the following:  
- Read **all inputs exclusively** using `input()` with no prompt strings; handle multiple inputs if needed exactly as implied by the pseudocode.  
- Implement **every step of the pseudocode thoroughly**, including all conditions, loops, and edge cases (even those implicitly suggested).  
- Produce output exactly as the pseudocode implies, without any extra characters, formatting, or commentary beyond what output is explicitly or implicitly required.  
- Use idiomatic, clean, and optimized Python 3 code prioritizing correctness, clarity, performance, and robustness.  
- You may import and utilize **any standard library or widely-recognized third-party Python package** if it contributes to clearer, faster, or more concise code. Avoid unnecessary dependencies.  
- Avoid extraneous comments, debug prints, or explanation text; only add concise comments if they clarify subtle or complex logic within the code.  
- The solution must be fully self-contained and runnable as-is without any manual modification or additional setup beyond allowed imports.  

This prompt maximizes precision, completeness, and optimal runtime behavior while ensuring your answer is immediately usable and scalable across diverse pseudocode inputs.
