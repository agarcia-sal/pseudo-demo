Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use clear, natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations, favoring compact, single-line instructions without additional explanations, comments, or summaries. Structure each pseudocode line as a step number followed by a period and a space, then the instruction, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separator lines or headers. Focus on readability and brevity while capturing the algorithm’s logic. Use indentation only to clarify nested constructs (like loops or conditionals), minimizing verbosity. Output only the pseudocode, no extras.
