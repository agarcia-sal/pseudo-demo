Generate clear, concise pseudocode that directly implements the problem’s logic using a mix of natural language and standard symbolic notation. Write mostly one-line instructions, combining control flow and operations to keep it compact but easily understandable.  
Use succinct declarations (e.g., “let x be integer,” “let A be vector of integers”), direct assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as needed.  
Number each line starting from 1 followed by a space and the instruction, for example:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid summaries, explanations, comments, clarifications, decorative formatting, or separator lines. Do not include output other than the numbered pseudocode lines.  
Prefer natural phrasing and clarity over extreme minimalism, yet keep the code high-level and tightly focused on algorithmic steps.  
Use standard common programming abbreviations and symbols, and capitalize keywords only if they improve readability, otherwise use lowercase.  
Offer no extra text outside the numbered pseudocode lines.
