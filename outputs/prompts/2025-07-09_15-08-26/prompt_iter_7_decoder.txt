Translate the entire given pseudocode into a fully functional, efficient, and optimized Python program that runs within 5 seconds. Your output must **only** contain the complete, runnable code enclosed in a single Python code block, formatted exactly as follows:

```python
# your complete Python code here
```

Follow these strict requirements:

- Handle **all input** strictly via `input()` (without prompt strings), and produce output exactly as implied by the pseudocode.
- Implement **all logical steps** explicitly described or strongly implied by the pseudocode; cover edge cases robustly.
- Avoid any non-code text, additional comments except those that clarify complex sections of code, or any extraneous output outside the code block.
- Use clean, readable, and idiomatic Python 3.x code optimized for clarity, correctness, and performance.
- You may freely import and employ any **standard or widely-used third-party Python libraries** if they help produce a clearer, faster, or more elegant solution.
- Your code must be complete and self-contained â€” after pasting it into a Python environment, it should run correctly without modifications or dependencies beyond the allowed imports.

This prompt encourages precision, completeness, and maximal runtime efficiency.
