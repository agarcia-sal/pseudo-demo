Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that directly implements the problem logic in clear, readable natural language with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Use mostly one-line instructions combining control flow and actions when this improves compactness without losing clarity.  
Number each line starting at 1, followed by a space and the instruction, for example:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use succinct declarations (e.g., "let x be integer," "let A be vector of integers"), direct assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as needed. Avoid summaries, explanations, comments, clarifications, or decorative formatting. Do not include separator lines or notes.

Prefer natural phrasing that preserves readability over minimalism, but keep the output compact and easy to follow. The output must be only the numbered pseudocode lines—no additional text or explanation.
