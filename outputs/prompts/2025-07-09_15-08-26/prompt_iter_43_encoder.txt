Generate clear, compact, and easy-to-read high-level pseudocode that directly implements the problem’s logic using natural language combined with standard symbolic notation and common programming abbreviations. Use mostly single-line statements that combine control flow and actions whenever it improves brevity without sacrificing clarity.  
Number each instruction starting at 1 with a space after the number, for example:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Prefer concise declarations (e.g., “let x be integer,” “let A be vector of integers”), straightforward assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as needed. Use natural phrasing that balances readability and compactness, minimizing verbosity. Avoid summaries, comments, explanations, or decorative formatting. Do not include separator lines or notes.  

Output only the numbered pseudocode lines exactly as formatted, nothing else.
