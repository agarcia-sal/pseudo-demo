Translate the given pseudocode into a single, complete, and runnable Python program. Your output must satisfy these constraints:

- Enclose the entire code within one Python code block exactly like this:

```python
# your Python code here
```

- Write clean, readable, and efficient Python code optimized for correctness and performance within a 5-second runtime limit.
- Your code should handle input strictly using `input()` without prompt strings.
- Avoid including any explanatory text, comments unrelated to code clarity, or extraneous output outside the code block.
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries or packages if they improve clarity or performance.
- Ensure the program addresses all logical steps implied by the pseudocode, correctly handles edge cases, and produces the expected output.
