Generate clear, concise pseudocode that directly implements the problem logic in a compact, high-level style using predominantly natural language mixed with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations.  
Use primarily one-line statements combining control flow and actions where it keeps the pseudocode compact without sacrificing readability or correctness.  
Number each line starting at 1, followed by a space, then the pseudocode instruction (e.g.,  

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

).  
Include succinct declarations (e.g., "let x be integer," "let A be vector of integers"), direct assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions as needed.  
Avoid summaries, explanations, comments, clarifications, or decorative formatting; produce only numbered pseudocode lines without any additional text or separators.  
Favor readability with natural phrasing over extreme minimalism, but keep the code compact and easy to follow.  
Use indentation sparingly only when absolutely necessary for nested blocks; otherwise prefer one-line constructs to maintain brevity.  
Do not use section breaks, horizontal lines, or notes. The output must be solely the numbered pseudocode lines in the described style.
