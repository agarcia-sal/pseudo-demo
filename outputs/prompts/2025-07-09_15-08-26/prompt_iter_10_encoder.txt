Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand, using mostly natural language enriched with symbolic notations and standard abbreviations. Produce compact instructions, preferably one-liners, avoiding unnecessary detail, comments, explanations, summaries, or notes. Present the pseudocode as a numbered list of sequential steps, each line starting with the step number followed by a period and a space, then the instruction, for example:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Use common pseudocode conventions like:  
- "let" to declare variables  
- "read" and "print" for input/output  
- "for i from 0 to n-1" or "for all elements in A" for loops  
- direct assignments and conditional shorthand (e.g., "set x to y if condition")  
Emphasize clarity and brevity to ensure accurate, compact pseudocode output within ~5 seconds. Output only the pseudocode, no additional text.
