Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, one-liners, symbolic forms, and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should clearly show the logic and flow, prioritizing readability and simplicity. Aim to produce the best result within 5 seconds.
