Analyze the provided pseudocode carefully and determine whether it is complete, deterministic, and free of ambiguities or contradictions, such that it can be implemented to consistently pass all corresponding unit tests on every valid input without relying on external information or assumptions. Consider correctness, clarity, and sufficiency of all steps. After evaluating, output only a single digit: 1 if the pseudocode is reproducible under these criteria, or 0 if it is not. When multiple pseudocode snippets are input sequentially, output the sequence of 1s and 0s in the same order, with no additional text or formatting.
