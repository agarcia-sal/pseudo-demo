Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a semantically identical version that differs maximally from the original in syntax, control flow, naming of variables (except for function and class names), formatting, and modular organization.  
- Keep all **function names** and **class names** exactly as in the original, preserving the original **class and object hierarchies** and structural boundaries without any alterations.  
- Rename all variable identifiers freely to new, distinct names to increase dissimilarity.  
- Restructure code logic using alternative constructs (e.g., replace loops with recursion or vice versa, reorder independent statements, change expressions) as long as the output and behavior remain identical.  
- Change formatting style and layout extensively (e.g., indentation, line breaks, use of intermediate variables).  
- Do **not** add comments or explanations; only output the transformed pseudocode that meets all above requirements.  
- Output only the pseudocodeâ€”no additional text.
