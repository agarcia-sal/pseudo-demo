Write compact, clear pseudocode that uses natural language and concise symbolic notation. Express algorithm steps as succinct one-liners, employing symbolic assignments (←, =), abbreviations, and high-level constructs. Use numbered lines starting at 1, formatted like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Structure loops and conditionals on one lines when concise, avoiding unnecessary keywords or verbose phrasing. Use intuitive naming but keep expressions minimal and direct.

Do not include explanations, comments, purpose, summaries, or notes. Only output pseudocode steps, no separators or extra formatting.

Aim for easy readability and understanding by blending natural language with symbolic and mathematical notation compactly, emphasizing clarity and brevity.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers with size n  
read elements into A  
for i from 0 to n-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j from i+1 to n-1, min_i ← j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
