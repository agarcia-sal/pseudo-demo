Write pseudocode in a concise, high-level, easy-to-read style using natural language, one-liners, symbolic assignments, and abbreviations. Do not include purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode steps. Use a numbered list format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for compactness and clarity, prefer one-liners, use loops and conditionals succinctly, and keep expressions straightforward. Your pseudocode should represent the logic clearly without extra details or wording.

Your function has a 5-second timeout; generate the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
