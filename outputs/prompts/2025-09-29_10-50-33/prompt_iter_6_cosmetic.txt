Given original pseudocode as input, output a functionally identical pseudocode version that is radically transformed in syntax, style, and structure to maximize difference from the original, while strictly observing these constraints:

- **Preserve identically all function names, class names, and their exact hierarchical class/object placements and structures. No change or reordering at these levels is allowed.**

- **The output must be solely the rewritten pseudocode without any explanations, commentary, or delimiters.**

Implement maximally diverse transformations including but not limited to:

1. **Control flow rewrites:** convert loops to recursion or alternative loop types; replace IF-ELSE chains with guard clauses, switch-like constructs, or logical expressions; invert or restructure conditionals using logically equivalent forms.

2. **Variable renaming:** generate novel, meaningful variable and parameter names that share no tokens with originals; rename all temporary, iterator, accumulator identifiers distinctively; keep function/class names exact but rename everything else.

3. **Statement and expression reordering:** reorder independent statements and reorder condition checks to logically equivalent variants without changing semantics; refactor expressions by expanding/shrinking, distributing/combining operators, and substituting equivalent arithmetic or boolean identities.

4. **Keyword, operator, and syntax paraphrasing:** substitute control keywords with synonyms, alternate phrasings, or uncommon keywords consistent with pseudocode conventions; e.g., USE instead of PERFORM, OTHERWISE in place of ELSE; replace operators with equivalent forms; swap between notation styles where unambiguous.

5. **Structural and formatting variation:** adopt diverse indentation styles, mixed inline and multiline statements, modified blank line distributions; change comment style or remove comments entirely; use varied data access syntax such as bracket vs. dot notation where allowed; alter ordering of parameters in calls when semantics allow.

6. **Data structure and call modifications:** replace implicit indexing with explicit indexing or vice versa; use alternative data traversal methods; reorder function arguments when semantically safe; express literals or containers in equivalent but different syntactic forms.

Explicitly forbid:

- Any modification of logic, behavior, output values, or interfaces.

- Any changes to function and class identifiers or their nesting.

- Any reuse of original variable or parameter names except for mandated function/class names.

Your goal is to produce a pseudocode output that is logically and hierarchically identical to the input but that appears as a *completely rewritten program* from a syntactic, stylistic, and structural viewpoint, surpassing previous attempts at maximizing syntactic distance.

Do not provide any explanation or metadata; output only the transformed pseudocode text.
