Given any input pseudocode, generate a fully semantically equivalent pseudocode version that exhibits maximal syntactic, stylistic, and structural disparity from the original while maintaining all semantic, logical, and interface integrity. 

Enforce strict invariants:

- **Preserve exactly all original function and class identifiers, including their spellings, nesting, and inheritance structures without any modifications, reorderings, or omissions.**

- **Produce output containing only the transformed pseudocode text, with no explanations, comments, delimiters, metadata, or annotations of any kind.**

Perform extensive, innovative rewriting across all other program elements with at least the following transformations (applied combinatorially and pervasively):

1. **Control Flow Overhaul:** Transform all loops into alternate looping constructs or recursion (e.g., FOR ↔ WHILE ↔ REPEAT-UNTIL ↔ tail recursive calls); rewrite conditional branches (IF-ELSE chains) into switch/case-like structures, guard clauses, inline conditional expressions, or boolean-expression short-circuiting; invert, flatten, nest, or restructure complex boolean conditions through rigorous boolean algebra, De Morgan’s laws, and distributive expansions while preserving exact logic.

2. **Radical Renaming of All Local Identifiers:** Replace every local variable, iterator, parameter (except those in function signatures), temporary values, and intermediate data container name with fresh, semantically meaningful, and completely non-overlapping names unrelated to any original identifier. Only keep function and class names intact.

3. **Rearrangement and Refactoring of Statements:** Reorder any statements or lines that are side-effect free or independent while keeping behavior identical; refactor and regroup expressions by expanding or factoring, introducing equivalent arithmetic/logical transformations, pushing negations inward/outward, converting operators between equivalent forms and mix of prefix/infix/postfix notation.

4. **Diverse Syntax and Keyword Variation:** Substitute canonical control keywords with less common or pseudocode-style equivalents (e.g., EXECUTE, INVOKE, REPEAT-UNTIL, BREAK, HALT, CONTINUE) or symbolic variants consistent with widely accepted pseudocode conventions; interchange dot vs bracket data access notation where valid; change parameter passing styles (positional ⇄ named) or safe argument reorderings; vary code block delimiters, indentation, and line breaking styles extensively.

5. **Structural and Formatting Reimagination:** Transform code layout by dramatically altering indentation spaces/tabs, line breaks, inline vs multiline structuring, blank line insertions/removals, and grouping styles; optionally remove all comments or convert them into alternative styles (if present) without revealing transformations.

6. **Data Access and Data Structure Reformulation:** Swap implicit iteration mechanisms for explicit indexing or iterator patterns; apply functional transformations like map/filter/lambda where appropriate; represent literals, sets, lists, and tuples interchangeably with semantically equivalent alternative syntaxes; reorder function call arguments safely to enhance syntactic difference.

Strictly forbid any of the following:

- Changes to program semantics, logic, outputs, side effects, or interface signatures.

- Any modification to or reuse of original variable or parameter names apart from function and class identifiers.

- Altering the identity, names, nesting, or ordering of classes and functions.

The final output must be a standalone, radically different yet semantically identical pseudocode that faithfully preserves the original program’s class and function boundaries and can be recognized as an independent reauthoring of the input.

Output ONLY the pseudocode text.
