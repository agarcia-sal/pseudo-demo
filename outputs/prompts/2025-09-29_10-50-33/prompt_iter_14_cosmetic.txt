Given any input pseudocode, generate a semantically identical pseudocode output that exhibits maximal syntactic, stylistic, and organizational divergence from the original, under these strict criteria:

- **Function and Class Identifiers:** Preserve all original function and class names exactly as they appear, including their nesting and inheritance relationships; do not alter, reorder, or rename them in any way.

- **Output Format:** Produce only the transformed pseudocode text alone with no extraneous elements such as explanations, comments, delimiters, annotations, or metadata.

To achieve maximal difference while maintaining correctness, apply all applicable transformations comprehensively and creatively, including but not limited to:

1. **Control Flow & Logic Refactoring:**  
   - Substitute loops with recursion or alternate iteration constructs (REPEAT…UNTIL, WHILE, tail-recursion) and vice versa.  
   - Transform IF-ELSE chains into SWITCH-CASE, nested ternary expressions, guard clauses, or boolean short-circuiting patterns.  
   - Logical conditions must be rewritten extensively applying equivalences, De Morgan’s laws, boolean distribution, negation pushing/pulling, and condition inversions or reordering to restructure predicate logic.

2. **Systematic Variable and Parameter Renaming:**  
   - Invent completely new, contextually plausible names for every local variable, parameter, loop index, accumulator, temporary, or intermediate data symbol. None of these names may overlap with the original tokens or identifiers.  
   - The only identifiers retained verbatim are class and function names as stipulated.

3. **Statement & Expression Rearrangement:**  
   - Reorder independent statements and reorder or regroup logical tests without changing program meaning.  
   - Expand or factor arithmetic and boolean expressions, convert operator forms (infix↔prefix, alternative comparison representations such as ≤ → ¬ >), rewrite arithmetic identities (adding zero, multiplying by one), and exploit algebraic/logical equivalences thoroughly.

4. **Keyword, Syntax & Style Variation:**  
   - Replace standard control keywords and constructs with synonymous or pseudocode-idiomatic variants (e.g., EXECUTE, INVOKE, BREAK instead of RETURN where appropriate).  
   - Alternate between style variants such as inline vs. multiline conditionals, different indentation patterns, and variable line breaks.  
   - Use varied parameter passing conventions (positional, named, reordered if semantically permissible) and notation styles (dot vs. bracket for data access).

5. **Data Structure & Access Strategy Changes:**  
   - Switch implicit container iterations to explicit indexing or explicit iterator patterns (mapping, filtering with lambdas, unrolling).  
   - Represent literals and containers using alternate but semantically equivalent syntaxes (e.g., lists as tuples or sets), reorder container elements when safe.

6. **Structural & Formatting Diversity:**  
   - Modify indentation schemes, line spacing, and grouping of code blocks to create visually distinct layouts while preserving logical structure.  
   - Remove all comments or replace original comments entirely with alternative styles or omit completely.

Absolutely prohibit:  
- Any changes to program semantics, logic flow, output behavior, side effects, or interface signatures.  
- Any alteration to function/class names or their exact hierarchical structure.  
- Reusing or preserving any original local variable or parameter names.

Your final output must preserve the full original hierarchical class/object/function organization while appearing as a completely independently authored pseudocode variant accomplishing the same tasks.

OUTPUT ONLY THE TRANSFORMED PSEUDOCODE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL TEXT.
