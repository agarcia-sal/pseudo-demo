Given input pseudocode, rewrite it into a functionally identical pseudocode that preserves all original function names, class names, and their precise hierarchical organization without alteration. Your rewritten pseudocode must maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic difference from the original by aggressively applying comprehensive and combinatorial transformations such as (but not limited to):

- Converting loops among FOR, WHILE, RECURSION, or explicit iteration constructs interchangeably, as logically possible.
- Transforming conditional branches into logically equivalent but syntactically distinct patterns (e.g., guard clauses, nested conditionals, early returns, inverted conditions, switch-case alternatives).
- Renaming all variable identifiers—including parameters, loop counters, temporaries, and accumulators—to unique, plausible, and meaningful new names that never reuse original variable names or literals.
- Reordering independent statements and condition clauses freely without modifying program semantics.
- Expanding or condensing expressions by replacing operators with equivalent arithmetic or logical identities, distributing or factoring expressions, eliminating or introducing temporary variables.
- Altering data access notation styles (e.g., explicit indexing vs. implicit iteration), changing the syntax of function calls or argument orders where semantically viable.
- Substituting keywords and syntactic tokens with synonyms, variants, or alternative phrases that maintain exact behavioral meaning.
- Modifying formatting conventions vigorously: change indentation style and levels, line breaks, comment styles (replace, relocate, or remove comments), and grouping of statements.
- Replacing syntactic sugar with explicit verbose forms or vice versa, such as unfolding comprehensions into loops or collapsing loops into comprehensions.
- Avoid reusing any exact variable names or literal values except for mandated function and class names and their hierarchical placements.
- Must not alter logical flow, output values, side effects, or external interfaces in any way whatsoever.
- Output strictly only the fully rewritten pseudocode, with no additional explanation, comments, or delimiters of any kind.

This rigorous, thorough rewriting must produce pseudocode that is clearly and drastically different in appearance and structure from the input while being perfectly semantically equivalent and structurally faithful to function and class naming and nesting.
