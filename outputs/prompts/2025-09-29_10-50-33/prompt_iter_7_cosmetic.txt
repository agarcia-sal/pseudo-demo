Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce an output that is a functionally equivalent version rewritten to maximize syntactic, stylistic, structural, and lexical divergence from the original, subject to these explicit rules:

- **Do not alter any function names, class names, or their exact hierarchical nesting, ordering, or placement. These identifiers and their structure must remain strictly unchanged.**

- **All other identifiers—variable names, parameter names, temporary variables, loop indices, accumulators, constants, and data structure keys—must be replaced with freshly minted, meaningful names that share no substring tokens with the original identifiers.**

- **The output must be solely the transformed pseudocode, without any explanation, headings, comments, annotations, delimiters, or metadata, and without any direct reuse of original code fragments outside preserved names.**

Apply aggressive and diverse rewriting transformations encompassing but not limited to:

1. **Control flow refactoring:** interchange iterative loops with recursion or alternative iteration constructs; convert if-else-if chains into guard clauses, switch-case or pattern-match analogues; re-express conditionals using logically equivalent but structurally different boolean combinations, negations, De Morgan’s laws, or early returns.

2. **Statement and expression remodeling:** reorder semantically independent statements and reorder evaluation sequences of conditions without changing meaning; break down complex expressions or combine simple expressions via algebraic and logical identities; replace common operators by equivalent variants or synonyms (e.g., modulo ↔ remainder, increment ↔ addition assignment); switch between explicit indexing, iterators, pointers, or cursor styles in traversals.

3. **Syntax and keyword variation:** substitute common control keywords with rare or synonymous pseudocode forms compatible with general pseudocode conventions; rephrase conditionals and loops, e.g., USING instead of FOR, OTHERWISE instead of ELSE, PERFORM instead of EXECUTE; systematically vary notation styles (e.g., dot vs bracket access where unambiguous) and delimiter styles; vary spacing, indentation, line breaks, and optional syntactic elements to alter formatting drastically.

4. **Data structure and semantic-preserving API mutation:** transform arrays to list or tuple styles (or vice versa), swap implicit for explicit indexes, change order of function arguments where semantics allow, replace direct data retrieval with iterators or query filters when possible, alter literal representations (e.g., numeral bases, tuple vs list notation, set vs list).

Strictly forbid:

- Any change or rearrangement to the function and class identifier names and their nesting.

- Any modifications to functional behavior, logic, output types, return values, or interfaces.

- Any reuse of original variable/parameter names; they must all be systematically renamed.

Your output should be a pseudocode snippet that looks like an independent rewrite—different in every feasible syntactic and stylistic dimension—from the input but functionally and hierarchically identical, strictly respecting the above constraints.

Output only the rewritten pseudocode text.
