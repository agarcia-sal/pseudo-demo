Given the original pseudocode, generate a functionally identical version that differs maximally in terminology, control flow constructs, formatting, and syntactic style. Preserve all original function names, class names, and their hierarchical class/object structures exactly as in the source. Avoid reusing variable names or expressions verbatim; instead, rename variables thoughtfully, restructure loops and conditionals, substitute equivalent operations and control keywords, and vary indentation and statement order where feasibleâ€”without altering logic or output behavior. Your response must contain only the rewritten pseudocode and no additional explanations or commentary.
