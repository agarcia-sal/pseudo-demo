Given any input pseudocode, transform it into a semantically equivalent pseudocode version that is profoundly and systematically reimagined to maximize syntactic, stylistic, and structural distance from the original pseudocode, abiding by these strict directives:

- Preserve **all original function and class names identically**, maintaining their full nesting, scope, and inheritance structure exactly; these identifiers and their hierarchical arrangements must not be renamed, reordered, or modified in any way.

- Output **only the transformed pseudocode text** with no additional explanation, comments, delimiters, or metadata.

Apply extensive, multifaceted rewriting at every other level—employing a wide, varied palette of transformations including but not limited to:

1. **Control Flow Restructuring:** Replace all loops with alternative constructs (e.g., convert FOR loops to WHILE, DO-WHILE, or recursion); transform IF-ELSE chains into switch/case analogies, guard conditions, ternary operators, or boolean short-circuit patterns; invert and distribute conditions using boolean algebra equivalences (De Morgan’s, double negation, distributive laws); split or merge conditionals strategically to produce novel branching structures that retain logic but differ substantially in flow and readability.

2. **Systematic Identifier Renaming:** Rename every local variable, parameter, temporary, accumulator, iterator, and intermediate container to freshly coined, meaningful names wholly distinct and unrelated to the original identifiers; generate plausible but novel token names ensuring zero overlap with original local variables; **only function and class names remain unchanged**. Vary not only identifiers but also parameter naming and argument passing styles (positional vs named) when semantics allow.

3. **Statement & Expression Transformation:** Decompose, reorder, and regroup independent statements and sub-expressions freely, as long as semantic equivalence is conserved; rewrite arithmetic and logical expressions by expanding/factoring, pushing or pulling negations, applying equivalences (e.g., replace “a ≤ b” with “NOT (a > b)”), convert between prefix, infix, and postfix notation as appropriate; reorder function arguments where it causes no side effects; convert attribute access between dot and bracket notations where valid.

4. **Keyword and Syntax Variation:** Substitute canonical control keywords with valid but less common synonyms or custom pseudocode constructs consistent with the domain (e.g., EXECUTE, INVOKE, REPEAT…UNTIL, BREAK instead of RETURN); introduce alternative parameter passing styles (explicit named arguments, tuples, destructured parameters) where applicable; use mixed indentation, line breaking, and inline/multiline statements to alter code appearance dramatically.

5. **Structural, Formatting, and Organizing Changes:** Vary indentation depth and style (tabs, spaces, mixed), adjust spacing and line breaks liberally, reorder logically independent blocks or statements, optionally inline short functions or break long expressions across lines; preserve original hierarchical organization of classes and functions, but diversify internal structural layout and flow presentation.

6. **Data Structure and Access Reformulation:** Alter container types and representation (e.g., convert sets to lists or tuples), switch implicit iteration to explicit indexing and vice versa; employ alternate traversal strategies such as iterator patterns, filtering with lambdas, loop unrolling; remap literal representations and constants to equivalent but syntactically distinct forms (e.g., “0” as “FALSE” where semantically valid).

Strictly enforce:

- No alteration of program semantics, functional behavior, output, side effects, or interface signatures beyond the local variable renaming and flow restructuring allowed.

- No modification, renaming, reordering, or restructuring of function or class identifiers or their exact containment hierarchies.

- Zero retention or reuse of original local variable or parameter names—complete obliteration of original tokens except function and class identifiers.

Your output must maintain the same function/class architecture while presenting a pseudocode version so syntactically detached and stylistically novel that it appears as an entirely independently authored but semantically identical program.

Output nothing besides the transformed pseudocode itself.
