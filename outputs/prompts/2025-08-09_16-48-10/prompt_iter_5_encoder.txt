Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use compact, high-level instructions with natural language, one-liners, symbolic assignments, and abbreviations. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only pseudocode. Format steps as numbered lines, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second timeout.
