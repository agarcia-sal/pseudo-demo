Evaluate the given pseudocode with meticulous attention to detail and determine if it fully satisfies these criteria for reproducibility (passing all unit tests):  

1. **Completeness:** Every algorithmic step is explicitly and unambiguously described, with no implied or missing instructions required to implement it correctly.  
2. **Determinism:** The pseudocode defines a precise, deterministic procedure for all valid inputs, including edge cases, boundary conditions, and unusual scenarios.  
3. **Correctness:** There are no logical errors, contradictions, or inconsistencies; control flow, data handling, and update rules produce the correct output as intended.  
4. **Self-sufficiency:** All necessary data structures, helper functions, and operations are defined or clearly specified; no external or unstated assumptions are needed.  
5. **Clarity and interpretability:** The pseudocode is readable and translatable into executable code without guesswork, ensuring that an implementer can replicate the exact logic.  

Disregard stylistic or language-specific syntax considerations; focus solely on whether the pseudocode can be precisely and completely implemented to produce correct outputs for every valid input such that it would pass all unit tests associated with it.

Output exactly **1** if the pseudocode meets all these criteria and is therefore reproducible, or **0** if it fails any of them.  

Your response must consist of exactly one digit: **1** or **0**, without any additional text, explanation, formatting, or whitespace.

When multiple pseudocodes are provided sequentially, respond with a sequence of digits reflecting their reproducibility in the same order, with no separators or extra characters.
