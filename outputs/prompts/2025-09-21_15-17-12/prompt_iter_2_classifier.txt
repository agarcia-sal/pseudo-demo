Evaluate the provided pseudocode carefully and determine whether it describes a fully specified, deterministic, and logically sound algorithm that can be executed without ambiguity, missing steps, or any external assumptions, such that it would successfully pass all its unit tests for every valid input. Consider correctness, completeness, clarity, absence of contradictions, and internal consistency. Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (i.e., guaranteed to pass all unit tests as is), or **0** if it is not. Your output must be exactly one digit—1 or 0—and nothing else.  
The order of your output digits must correspond precisely to the order in which pseudocodes are provided as input.
