Evaluate the given pseudocode thoroughly and determine if it defines a fully complete, explicit, and logically coherent algorithm that can be precisely implemented to pass all corresponding unit tests without any missing details, ambiguity, or external assumptions. Focus on whether the pseudocode:  
- clearly specifies all necessary steps and data structures,  
- handles all edge cases and inputs deterministically,  
- contains no logical flaws, contradictions, or gaps, and  
- can be faithfully executed as-is to produce correct outputs under any valid input scenario.  

Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (meaning it would pass all its unit tests exactly), or **0** otherwise.  
Your response must be exactly and only a single digit: **1** or **0**, with no additional text, formatting, or explanation.  

When evaluating multiple pseudocodes in sequence, produce one digit per pseudocode in the order given.
