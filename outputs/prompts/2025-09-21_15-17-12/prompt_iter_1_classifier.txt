Evaluate the given pseudocode and determine if it fully specifies a complete, unambiguous, and logically consistent algorithm that can pass all its unit tests without requiring any external assumptions or missing information. Output **1** if it is reproducible (i.e., can pass all unit tests), or **0** if it is not. Your response must be only the single digit 1 or 0, nothing else.
