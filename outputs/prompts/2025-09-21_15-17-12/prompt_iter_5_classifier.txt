Carefully analyze the given pseudocode to verify whether it fully and unambiguously specifies a complete, self-contained algorithm that can be faithfully and deterministically implemented to pass all relevant unit tests under every valid input, without requiring any external information, assumptions, or corrections. Specifically confirm that:  
- every variable, data structure, function, and operation is clearly defined and used consistently,  
- all control flows, loops, and conditions cover every input and edge case with no gaps or contradictions,  
- the logic is correct, internally consistent, and sufficient to produce correct outputs exactly as stated,  
- no crucial detail (such as indexing bounds, initialization, termination, updates, or return values) is omitted or left ambiguous, and  
- the pseudocode as given could be directly translated into working code that passes every test case for the described problem.  

If the pseudocode meets all these strict reproducibility criteria, output exactly **1**; if it fails in any way (incompleteness, ambiguity, logical error, missing detail, or external dependency), output exactly **0**.  

Your response must be exactly one character—either **1** or **0**—with no explanation, formatting, or extra content. When multiple pseudocodes are input sequentially, provide one digit per pseudocode in the given order.
