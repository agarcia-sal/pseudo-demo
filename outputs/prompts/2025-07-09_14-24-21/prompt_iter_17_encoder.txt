Write concise, high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand. Use natural language, abbreviations, and symbolic operators. Express logic clearly but compactly, preferably in one line per step. Number each step sequentially as in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—only the pseudocode itself. Avoid verbose statements; focus on precise instructions using compact constructs. Do not use horizontal separators or extra formatting beyond numbering. Reflect typical programming constructs naturally (e.g., loops, conditionals) while keeping each step brief and self-contained. The output should be a runnable-style pseudocode outline capturing all essential algorithmic steps clearly within a strict 5-second generation limit.
