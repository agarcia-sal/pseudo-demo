Write clear, concise, and easy-to-read pseudocode that captures all essential algorithmic steps at a high level using natural language, abbreviations, and symbolic operators. Keep each step as a single line wherever possible, focusing on compact expressions of logic and control flow (e.g., loops, conditionals). Number each step sequentially as:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use consistent indentation for nested blocks but avoid verbose wording, comments, explanations, or summaries—output only the pseudocode. Do not include separator lines or extra formatting beyond numbering. Prefer minimal but clear instructions suitable for a runnable-style outline. Your pseudocode should be generalizable, maintain clarity, and generate within a strict 5-second limit.  

Example output style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
