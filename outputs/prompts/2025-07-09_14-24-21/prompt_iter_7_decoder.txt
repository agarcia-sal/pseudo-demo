Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and high-performance Python code that strictly uses `input()` without prompt strings for all input reading and prints the exact expected output. Your solution must be fully self-contained, robust, and optimized to run within 5 seconds on typical competitive programming input sizes. 

- Import any standard Python libraries you find useful for efficiency or clarity.
- Write concise, well-structured code with meaningful variable names and clear logic.
- Handle all input parsing and output formatting within the code.
- Your entire solution must be enclosed exactly in a single Python code block as follows:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Do NOT include any additional explanations, comments beyond what is necessary for code clarity, or extra text outside the code block.
