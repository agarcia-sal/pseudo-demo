Translate the given pseudocode into a single, complete, and ready-to-run Python program that strictly meets the following requirements:

- Use only `input()` without any prompt strings to read all inputs exactly as needed.
- Produce output that precisely matches the logic and intent of the pseudocode.
- Write concise, clean, idiomatic, and well-optimized Python code designed for clarity, robustness, and maximum performance within a 5-second timeout.
- You may import and use any standard Python library or module to enhance efficiency and readability.
- Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional textâ€”output only one Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# your code here
```

This ensures consistency, correctness, and optimal runtime performance on all test cases.
