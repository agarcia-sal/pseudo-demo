Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, abbreviations, and symbolic representations. Prefer compact, high-level one-liners. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure steps are numbered and the pseudocode is understandable. Your function has a 5-second timeout—optimize for clarity and brevity within this limit.
