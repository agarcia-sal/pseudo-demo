Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, fully functional Python program that strictly meets the following requirements:

- Read all input exclusively using plain `input()` calls without any prompt strings.
- Directly produce the exact output as implied by the pseudocode logic.
- Implement the solution efficiently with optimized, idiomatic Python code that executes well within 5 seconds.
- Include the entire translated code inside one and only one Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# Your Python code here
```

- Use only standard Python libraries and packages that are universally available.
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code employing best practices for clarity and performance.
- Avoid any additional explanations, comments outside the code block, or extraneous text before or after the code.
- Do not include separator lines or any formatting other than the required code block.

Provide the final, ready-to-run Python program following these instructions precisely.
