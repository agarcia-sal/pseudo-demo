Translate the given pseudocode into concise, idiomatic, and optimized Python code that runs efficiently within 5 seconds. Your solution must:

- Use only plain `input()` calls without prompt strings to read all inputs exactly as required.
- Produce the correct output matching the pseudocode's intent.
- Include all necessary code wrapped strictly inside a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# translated Python code here
```

- Leverage standard Python libraries and best practices for clarity, robustness, and performance.
- Avoid any extraneous text, explanations, or separator linesâ€”only output the Python code block.

Write the complete, ready-to-run Python program fulfilling these criteria.
