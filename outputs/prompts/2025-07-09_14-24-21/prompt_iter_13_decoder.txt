Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, efficient, and idiomatic Python program that executes correctly within 5 seconds. Your code must adhere to the following requirements:

- Read all inputs strictly with plain `input()` calls without any prompt strings.
- Produce output exactly as dictated by the pseudocodeâ€™s logic, handling all edge cases correctly.
- Use only standard libraries available in Python 3. No third-party packages.
- Optimize for clarity, correctness, and performance with clean, maintainable code.
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block, formatted exactly like this:

```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

- Avoid any extra text, comments, explanation, or separator lines outside the code block.
- The solution must be ready-to-run and self-contained.

Focus on writing concise, robust, and idiomatic Python code that precisely implements the given pseudocode in all respects.
