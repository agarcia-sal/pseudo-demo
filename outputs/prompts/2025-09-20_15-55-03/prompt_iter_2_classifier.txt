Given the provided analyses and the shortcomings of the prior prompt, your improved prompt should:

- Emphasize *functional completeness* and *unambiguity* of all logic paths, ensuring no missing steps, undefined variables, or unclear behavior, which can cause failure in unit tests.
- Explicitly require internal consistency among definitions, control flow, and data updates.
- Enforce the assumption that all necessary inputs/outputs and intermediate states are fully specified.
- Demand the detection of subtle logical errors or incomplete constructs that can cause pseudocode to fail tests, even if superficially logical.
- Instruct to consider all nested functions, loops, conditionals, and data manipulations.
- Require output strictly as 1 or 0, no explanation or other text.
- Impose that the order of output corresponds exactly to the input pseudocode order.

Here is the enhanced prompt that incorporates these improvements:

**Enhanced Prompt:**

Analyze each given pseudocode snippet carefully and determine whether it is fully specified, logically coherent, and sufficiently complete to deterministically produce correct outputs for all valid inputs in its intended problem domain, thereby passing all associated unit tests without requiring assumptions or missing information.

Specifically, verify that:

- All variables, functions, and data structures are clearly and consistently defined and updated.
- Control flow paths (loops, conditionals, function calls) cover all possible cases without ambiguity or undefined behavior.
- The pseudocode fully describes all necessary computational steps to achieve the intended task, leaving no critical gaps or reliance on unstated knowledge.
- The logic is internally consistent with no contradictions or oversights that would cause runtime errors, incorrect results, or incomplete computations.
- All nested or helper functions are properly integrated and invoked with appropriate parameters and side-effects are well managed.

For each pseudocode input in the sequence provided, output a single digit:

- **1** if it meets all the above criteria and can be considered reproducible—i.e., guaranteed to pass all unit tests for its problem.
- **0** otherwise.

Do not output any explanations, reasons, or additional formatting—only the digits "1" or "0" in order, one per input, matching exactly the input sequence.

This prompt better guides the model to assess *functional correctness and completeness* in a comprehensive, methodical manner, addressing the false positives and false negatives identified in the evaluation examples. It pushes beyond simple "fully specified" or "logically consistent" to also require demonstration of *deterministic completeness* and *error-free logic*, which is critical for reliable reproducibility judgment.

**Output only this prompt text.**
