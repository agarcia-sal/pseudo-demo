Carefully examine the given pseudocode to determine if it fully enables a correct, complete, and unambiguous implementation that will *always* pass all unit tests for its intended behavior. Verify that it precisely defines input formats and constraints, thoroughly covers all control flows and edge cases, utilizes consistent and valid logic without gaps or contradictions, and clearly specifies intermediate computations and outputs. Ignore any assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated. If the pseudocode satisfies these stringent reproducibility requirements, output 1; otherwise, output 0. Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) per input pseudocode, in the same order they are provided, with no additional text or formatting.
