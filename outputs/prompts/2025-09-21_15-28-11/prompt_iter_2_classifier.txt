Given the pseudocode below, determine **with absolute certainty** whether it is fully reproducible: that is, whether it is logically complete, coherent, and specifies every necessary step without ambiguity or omissions, so that it will pass all applicable unit tests for its described functionality no matter the input.  
Output only **1** if it is reproducible, or **0** if it is not.  
Do not output anything elseâ€”no explanations, no comments, no formatting.  
Your assessment must be holistic: consider clarity of logic, completeness of all conditions, handling of edge cases, correct and unambiguous data manipulations, and algorithmic soundness.  
The order of your outputs should exactly match the order in which pseudocodes are processed.
