Given the pseudocode below, determine **solely based on its logical completeness, unambiguity, and explicitness sufficient to pass all standard unit tests for its described functionality**, whether it is fully reproducible.  
Specifically, check that the pseudocode:  
- clearly defines all input/output, variables, and functions with no missing steps or implicit assumptions,  
- proceeds with unambiguous control flow and data manipulation enabling deterministic correct outputs for all valid inputs,  
- includes all necessary initializations and updates,  
- and avoids any logical inconsistencies, incompleteness, or unstated behaviors that would cause unit tests to fail.

Output only **1** if the pseudocode meets all these criteria and would pass all relevant unit tests, **0** otherwise.  
Do not output anything other than the sequence of 1s and 0s strictly corresponding to the order of provided pseudocodes.  
Do not provide explanations or additional text.
