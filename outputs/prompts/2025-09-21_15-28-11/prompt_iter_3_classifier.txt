Given the pseudocode below, determine if it is fully reproducible, meeting these criteria:  
- **Complete:** contains all necessary steps without omissions to fulfill its described functionality.  
- **Unambiguous:** free from vagueness or multiple interpretations that could prevent consistent implementation.  
- **Accurate:** logically consistent, with clearly defined inputs, outputs, and intermediate operations.  
- **Executable:** structured so it can deterministically pass all conventional unit tests for the intended task.  

Assess all logical branches, data manipulations, control flows, and edge cases described in the pseudocode. If the pseudocode meets all these conditions so that an implementation based on it would reliably pass every relevant unit test, output **1**. Otherwise, output **0**.  

**Output only a sequence of 1s and 0s, corresponding exactly in order to each pseudocode provided, with no additional text or formatting.**
