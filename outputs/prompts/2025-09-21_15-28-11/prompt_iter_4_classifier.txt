Given the pseudocode below, rigorously evaluate whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”that is, logically complete, unambiguous, and sufficiently detailed to pass *all* appropriate unit tests for the intended task without requiring any external assumptions, clarifications, or additional information.  
Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets these reproducibility criteria, otherwise output **0**.  
**Strictly output only the digit 1 or 0, nothing else.**  
Consider all aspects including: clear variable initialization, correct control flow, comprehensive handling of edge cases, defined return values, and consistency in operations.  
The outputs must correspond *exactly* in order to the order of the pseudocode inputs.  
Pseudocode: ```{input}```
