Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, well-structured Python code that executes correctly within 5 seconds.  
- Enclose the entire solution in a single Python code block formatted as:  

```python
# your translated Python code here
```  

- Use plain `input()` calls without prompt strings for all inputs.  
- Avoid any print formatting other than what’s required for output correctness.  
- Make your code concise yet readable, with clarity prioritized for correctness and performance.  
- Include minimal inline comments only if they directly enhance code clarity or correctness.  
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries as needed.  
- Do not insert separator lines or extra explanations—only output the final Python code in the specified code block.
