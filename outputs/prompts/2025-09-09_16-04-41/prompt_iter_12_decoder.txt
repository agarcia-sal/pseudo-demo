Translate the given pseudocode into correct, clean, idiomatic, and fully functional Python code according to these strict guidelines:

- Use the **exact same class names, function/method names, and data structures** as specified by the pseudocode. Place functions or methods inside their respective classes exactly as implied.
- Adhere strictly to the logic, control flow, and data operations described in the pseudocode. Resolve any minor ambiguities or inconsistencies logically but **do not alter the intended functionality**.
- Your output must be a single, self-contained, executable snippet entirely enclosed **only** inside one Python code block formatted as ```python ... ```, with no explanations, comments, or any text outside this block.
- Include all necessary imports within the code block, and you may leverage any Python standard libraries or common third-party packages to improve clarity, correctness, or performance.
- Do **not** define, assume, or instantiate any wrapper classes (e.g., no `Solution` class) unless explicitly specified by the pseudocode.
- Ensure your code will run standalone without external dependencies or manual wrapping.
- Prioritize readability, maintainability, and efficiency, and avoid any redundant, overly verbose, or unclear constructs.
- Your code must perform correctly and efficiently within a 5-second runtime limit on typical inputs.
