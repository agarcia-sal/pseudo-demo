Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and efficient Python code. Ensure that your output:

- Preserves all original function names, class names, and data structures exactly as indicated in the pseudocode.
- Includes all relevant class and helper definitions if required by the pseudocode.
- Is enclosed in a single Python code block formatted as ```python ... ``` with no additional explanations or comments outside the code block.
- Does not rely on any undefined wrapper classes or methods (e.g., do not instantiate or reference undefined classes like `Solution` unless explicitly stated).
- Produces self-contained and executable code given the input implied by the pseudocode.
- Prioritizes clarity, idiomatic Python style, and optimal performance while running within 5 seconds.
- Uses any Python standard or third-party packages if they can enhance code clarity or efficiency without violating above constraints.
