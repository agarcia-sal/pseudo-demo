Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language in a compact, high-level style with one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only pseudocode. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second timeout to produce the best possible pseudocode.
