Translate the following pseudocode into fully functional, optimized, and idiomatic Python code with the exact class names and method signatures as given. Preserve all original class and function names as well as data structures. Your translation should focus on:

- Correctness, ensuring it matches the pseudocode logic verbatim.
- Readability, employing clear, concise syntax and Pythonic constructs.
- Efficiency, using optimal algorithms and appropriate standard libraries or packages if needed.
- Maintaining the method inside the original class as indicated by the pseudocode.
- No additional explanations, comments, or text outside the code unless directly reflecting the pseudocode.

Enclose your entire solution strictly within a Python code block formatted as:

```python
# your complete translated code here
```

Do not include separators, commentary, or any output beyond this code block.

Complete the translation within 5 seconds, returning the best possible quality code within this limit.
