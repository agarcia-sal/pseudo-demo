Write pseudocode that directly implements the solution described in the problem without any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not include notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode. Make it easy to read and understandable by using concise, natural language phrasing, with symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate. Prefer compact, high-level expressions and one-liners. Follow this format strictly, numbering each line:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Your pseudocode should focus on clarity and brevity while capturing the full logic to solve the problem efficiently. Remember, your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to produce the best result within this limit.
