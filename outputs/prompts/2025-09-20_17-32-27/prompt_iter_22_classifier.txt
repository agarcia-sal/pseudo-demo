Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently evaluate each for **complete, exact, and precise implementability** such that—if translated directly, line-by-line, into any standard programming language—they will pass **every valid unit test without fail**. These tests include normal cases, all edge and boundary conditions, and error scenarios within the declared input domain.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit with no spaces or delimiters:

- Output `1` if the pseudocode, as given, is **fully reproducible**: it provides all necessary definitions, logic, and details explicitly, contains no ambiguity or missing cases, no assumptions or external dependencies, no vague or incomplete instructions, and guarantees termination and correctness on all valid inputs.

- Output `0` otherwise (if *any* incompleteness, ambiguity, omission, imprecise descriptions, implicit assumptions, unstated constraints, external dependencies, contradictory logic, potential infinite loops, or insufficient edge/error handling is present).

---

### Rigorous Criteria for Reproducibility (all must be unequivocally met):

1. **Explicit and Complete Specification**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, types, data structures, functions, constants, and return values are fully declared or clearly inferable within the pseudocode’s text.  
   - Input and output formats, valid value ranges, data types, and structures are defined explicitly or unambiguously derivable without assumptions.  
   - No references to hidden, implicit, or external libraries, states, or global data beyond the pseudocode.

2. **Perfectly Clear, Deterministic Logic**  
   - Control flow (loops, recursion, conditionals) is specified with exact boundaries, iteration counts or termination conditions, and covers **all possible inputs without gaps**.  
   - Every branch or conditional explicitly handles all logically possible cases.  
   - Operations, updates, and side effects are fully detailed with exact semantics; no vague phrases like “handle errors” or “process accordingly” without concrete algorithmic steps.

3. **Consistent, Conventional Indexing and Operations**  
   - Indexing and data references use a consistent and explicitly stated convention (e.g., zero-based or one-based indexing), maintained coherently throughout.  
   - Order of evaluation, mutation effects, and intermediate state changes are precisely described and unambiguous.

4. **Self-Sufficiency and Context Independence**  
   - The pseudocode is a stand-alone artifact requiring no domain knowledge, external environment behavior, or unstated assumptions.  
   - All dependencies, preconditions, and assumptions are explicitly declared or logically derivable from the pseudocode and stated inputs/outputs.

5. **Complete and Exhaustive Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Coverage**  
   - Explicitly handles or logically excludes all boundary conditions (e.g., empty inputs, minimal/maximal values, invalid or malformed input if applicable).  
   - No input scenario can cause undefined behavior, silent failure, infinite loops, or implementation-dependent results.

6. **Logical Consistency Without Contradiction**  
   - No contradictions or conflicts in variable assignments or logic (e.g., use-before-initialization, mutually exclusive conditions simultaneously true, inconsistent state changes).  
   - Data structure invariants and semantics are maintained throughout.

7. **Direct Implementability Without Inference or Supplementary Detail**  
   - The pseudocode can be translated literally and directly into code, line-by-line, without requiring guesswork, external context, or added clarification.  
   - No placeholders, ambiguous terms, or omitted initializations/updates remain.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single uninterrupted sequence of digits (`1` or `0`) with no spaces, newlines, or additional characters.

- The output order matches the input order exactly.

- Output only the resulting digits, nothing else (no explanations, partial scores, comments, or disclaimers).

---

### Internal Judgment Guidelines (do NOT output):

- Any required assumption, guess, or inferred detail → output `0`.  
- Any vague, missing, imprecise, or incomplete description → output `0`.  
- Any implicit reliance on external knowledge, environment, or platform → output `0`.  
- Undefined, infinite, or ambiguous loops or control flows → output `0`.  
- Contradictory or inconsistent states → output `0`.  
- Complete, explicit, unambiguous, and fully self-contained pseudocode that guarantees passing all valid tests → output `1`.

---

### Summary:

Only output `1` for pseudocode that is **fully, exactly, and unambiguously implementable** to pass **all valid unit tests** without any external knowledge or assumptions. Output `0` otherwise. Your final answer for a batch of pseudocodes is a strict binary string representing reproducibility status in input order.

---

### Example:

- One perfectly specified pseudocode → `1`  
- One ambiguous or incomplete pseudocode → `0`  
- Three inputs with reproducible, non-reproducible, reproducible status → `101`

**Strictly output only the concatenated string of 1’s and 0’s with no additional text, explanation, or formatting.**
