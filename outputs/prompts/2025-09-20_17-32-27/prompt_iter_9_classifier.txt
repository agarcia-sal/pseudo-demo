Given one or more pseudocode inputs, determine for each whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be implemented exactly as presented to pass **all valid unit tests** (including edge, boundary, and exceptional cases) with **no ambiguity or missing details**.

For each pseudocode, output a single digit:  
- **1** if, and only if, the pseudocode meets every requirement below and thus is guaranteed to produce a correct, fully test-compliant implementation without needing assumptions or external information.  
- **0** otherwise.

### Rigorous criteria for fully reproducible pseudocode:

1. **Complete and explicit definitions**  
   - Every variable, data structure, function, procedure, or external entity referenced is either fully defined in the pseudocode or described so precisely that no guesswork is required.  
   - Inputs and outputs are clearly specified in type, format, meaning, and expected behaviors.  
   - No placeholder names, insufficient definitions, or implied dependencies.

2. **Unambiguous, fully detailed algorithmic flow**  
   - Control flows (loops, branches, recursion) have completely specified conditions, index ranges, loop invariants, initialization, and termination criteria.  
   - All branches cover every logical case with no unspecified gaps, contradictions, or unreachable code.  
   - Any iterative or recursive process is shown with clear base and progress toward termination.

3. **Deterministic, well-specified operations and state changes**  
   - Every operation (arithmetic, logical, indexing, mutation) has explicitly defined behavior and operand domains.  
   - No vague, approximate, or context-dependent instructions; no implicit assumptions about indexing bases or data structure behaviors.  
   - Data references (like array indices or tuple positions) are consistent and clearly ordered.

4. **Complete self-containment without external dependencies**  
   - The pseudocode does not require any unstated libraries, global variables, environment conditions, or initial states not fully described within the code.  
   - No reliance on undefined constants, unknown input constraints, or external data.

5. **Explicit or logically guaranteed edge case and error handling**  
   - All boundary conditions (empty inputs, minimal sizes, maximum sizes), exceptional cases (invalid or unexpected inputs), and special scenarios are either explicitly handled or are rendered impossible by the logic.  
   - No code paths lead to undefined, erroneous, or unsafe states.

6. **Logical consistency and semantic correctness**  
   - No contradictions, inconsistent variable uses (e.g., variables used before assignment), or logic errors.  
   - The steps and data manipulations align unambiguously toward the declared output goal.  
   - Updates to data structures maintain internal coherence without ambiguities, races, or conflicting states.

7. **Clarity of intent and output guarantees**  
   - The purpose of the algorithm and its expected outputs are clearly stated or unmistakably inferable from the pseudocode itself.  
   - Output formatting or returned data structures are explicitly specified or derivable unambiguously.

### Output instructions:  
- When multiple pseudocodes are provided sequentially, produce a string of digits, one per pseudocode in the input order, with no spaces, newlines, or other characters.  
- For each pseudocode, print **1** if it fully meets all above criteria, otherwise **0**.  
- Make a strict binary choice: do not assign partial credit or probabilistic correctness.  
- Do not output explanations, delimiters, or extra formatting—only the digit string.

---

### Important evaluation notes (implicit, do not output):  
- Consider initialization and data structure construction carefully—missing initial states often break reproducibility.  
- Ensure all loops and recursions have clearly defined start/end and termination conditions.  
- Verify that data manipulations respect structure invariants and indexing logic is precise and consistent.  
- Validate that all edge and corner cases can be handled with no undefined behavior or needed assumptions.  
- Identify any hidden dependencies or missing function definitions as failures.  
- Reject pseudocode that requires minor assumptions or inferred steps; only accept fully spelled out logic.

**Example outputs:**  
`1`  
`0`  
`101` (for three pseudocode inputs in order)

This prompt emphasizes exhaustive precision, clarity, and coverage of all test-relevant aspects to maximize correct identification of reproducible pseudocode while minimizing false negatives or positives. It improves upon prior methods by insisting on detailed, explicit flow and operations, plus unambiguous edge case treatment, eliminating mislabels from subtle ambiguities or assumptions.
