Given one or more pseudocode inputs, evaluate each **independently** to determine if it is **strictly reproducible** — that is, whether it can be implemented directly and precisely as provided, with **no ambiguity, missing information, or reliance on external contexts or assumptions**, and will **pass all comprehensive unit tests** (including normal, edge, boundary, and error scenarios) without exception.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit (concatenated with no spaces, line breaks, or extra characters):  
- Output **1** if the input pseudocode meets **all** reproducibility criteria below and can be expected to pass all valid unit tests when implemented exactly as-is.  
- Output **0** otherwise (if there is **any** ambiguity, incompleteness, underspecification, assumption, or logical flaw).

---

### Definitive Criteria for Strict Reproducibility (all must hold):

1. **Complete Explicitness and Scope**  
   - All variables, parameters, data structures, constants, functions, and return values are clearly named or definitively inferable **without making assumptions**.  
   - Input and output formats, types, ranges, and structures must be unambiguously defined or logically derivable solely from the pseudocode.  
   - No references to undeclared external libraries, platform-specific features, unknown globals, or hidden states.

2. **Fully Specified and Exhaustive Logic**  
   - Control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion) define precise boundaries, conditions, termination logic, and index conventions that prevent infinite loops or early/undefined termination.  
   - All branches collectively and explicitly cover every possible input scenario, including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases, with no implicit “default” or “catch-all” behavior lacking specification.  
   - All algorithmic operations and transformations are detailed clearly and concretely—no vague descriptions, placeholders, or outlines that require interpretation.

3. **Deterministic and Exact Operations**  
   - Every data access, mutation, comparison, arithmetic, and side effect is unambiguously defined with explicit semantics and consistent indexing (0-based or 1-based indexing stated or clearly evident and preserved throughout).  
   - Behavior does not depend on unspecified evaluation order, ambiguous state changes, or hidden side effects.

4. **Self-Contained Implementation Readiness**  
   - The pseudocode fully stands alone without need for external assumptions, domain knowledge, platform-specific behaviors, or implicit environmental factors.  
   - All dependencies, inputs, data constraints, and assumptions are explicitly stated or perfectly inferable from the pseudocode itself.

5. **Complete Edge and Error Case Handling**  
   - Edge, boundary, minimal/maximal, empty, and invalid inputs are either explicitly handled in the pseudocode or explicitly impossible per the defined input domain.  
   - There is no undefined, silent failure, or error-prone behavior under any valid input scenario.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Validity**  
   - No contradictions, conflicting conditions, use-before-assignment, or ambiguous/incoherent state transitions occur.  
   - Each step logically advances toward the declared function output or goal, maintaining structural and data consistency.

7. **Direct, Literal Implementability**  
   - Can be translated line-by-line into a standard programming language without requiring inference, supplementation, guesswork, or added details.  
   - All indexing, initializations, variable usages, loop ranges, and output constructions are fully explicit.

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single string of digits corresponding **in order** to the inputs, without spaces, newlines, or punctuation.  
- Output only the digit string; **do not output any explanations, comments, partial results, or additional text**.

---

### Internal Judging Notes (do not output):

- Any need for assumptions, interpretation, added context, or external domain knowledge → output `0`.  
- Any ambiguity, missing details, logic gaps, unspecified operations, or incomplete edge case coverage → output `0`.  
- Reliance on unstated platform behavior, or underspecified control flow and termination → output `0`.  
- Infinite or undefined loops, contradictory statements, or incomplete logical coverage → output `0`.  
- Only fully explicit, logically sound, self-contained, and unambiguous pseudocode → output `1`.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` **only** for pseudocode that can be **faithfully and directly implemented to pass all valid unit tests exactly as given**. Output `0` otherwise. The output is a strict reproducibility binary string reflecting each input pseudocode’s reproducibility status in the provided order.

---

**Example outputs:**  
- One fully reproducible pseudocode: `1`  
- One incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first and third are reproducible, second is not: `101`

**Strictly no output beyond the concatenated digit string.**
