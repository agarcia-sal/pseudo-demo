Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently analyze each to determine whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning it is explicitly and unambiguously complete such that a direct line-by-line implementation will inevitably pass **all valid unit tests without exception**, covering normal, edge, boundary, and error cases.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit—`1` if and only if the pseudocode satisfies *all* criteria necessary for immediate, unambiguous, fully-specified implementation that requires no assumptions or external knowledge; otherwise output `0`. Concatenate these digits in input order without spaces, newlines, or any other characters.

### Definitive Criteria for Reproducibility (all must be strictly met):

1. **Explicit and Complete Declarations**  
   - All variables, functions, parameters, constants, data structures, and return values must be introduced with clear types or formats, or be unambiguously inferable solely from the pseudocode.  
   - Input and output interfaces must specify formats, types, valid domain/ranges, and structure without requiring external clarification.  
   - No undefined variables, no unstated external dependencies, no implicit environment or platform assumptions.

2. **Clear, Exhaustive, and Non-Ambiguous Logic**  
   - Control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion) must provide explicit iteration bounds, termination conditions, and cover all input scenarios without uncovered branches or implicit cases.  
   - All algorithmic steps, condition evaluations, and state transitions must be fully described; vague terms like “handle as needed” or any placeholder comments without algorithmic specificity are disallowed.  
   - No hidden side effects or evaluation order ambiguities.

3. **Precise Data and State Manipulation**  
   - All data accesses, mutations, indexing schemes, arithmetic and logical operations must be defined with consistent conventions (e.g., zero- or one-based indexing declared or consistently used).  
   - No unclear or partially specified operations, ambiguous mutation orders, or implicit implicit type casts/transformations.  
   - Intermediate data structures and their mutations must be fully described.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Free**  
   - The pseudocode must be stand-alone—no hidden external knowledge, domain assumptions, or platform specificities.  
   - All necessary auxiliary functions and constants must be defined or derivable within the given code snippet and input/output specifications.

5. **Comprehensive Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - All edge and corner cases (empty inputs, minimal/maximal values, invalid or special inputs) are explicitly handled or demonstrated logically impossible.  
   - No conditions leading to undefined, erroneous, or silent failures.

6. **Logical Coherence and Consistency**  
   - No contradictions, such as using variables before initialization, conflicting logic paths, or inconsistent data states.  
   - Steps must clearly and logically flow toward fulfilling the declared goal without contradiction or ambiguity.

7. **Direct and Unambiguous Implementability**  
   - The pseudocode can be converted line-by-line into a working, correct implementation without guesswork, supplementation, or guess-based interpretations.  
   - All indexing, initialization, iteration, and return construction steps are fully detailed and explicit.

### Output Specification:

- When given multiple pseudocode inputs, output a **single string of digits**, with each digit corresponding exactly to one pseudocode’s reproducibility evaluation (in input order).  
- Output only `1` or `0` per pseudocode (1 = fully reproducible, 0 = otherwise).  
- Do not output spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other characters.

---

### Internal Judgment Rules (do **not** output these):

- Any required assumption, inference, supplementation, or guess leads to output `0`.  
- Ambiguity, partial specification, or implicit handling leads to `0`.  
- Reliance on unstated external libraries, language/platform specificities, or hidden environmental knowledge leads to `0`.  
- Infinite loops without clear termination or incomplete branching cause `0`.  
- Each pseudocode is judged strictly and independently.

---

### Summary:

Return `1` only if the pseudocode is unequivocally fully reproducible—i.e., immediately translatable into a correct program passing **all valid unit tests** across all scenarios without requiring anything beyond what is explicitly provided. Otherwise return `0`.

---

**Examples:**  
- One fully reproducible pseudocode → output: `1`  
- One incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first and third are reproducible, second is not → output: `101`

**Strictly output only the concatenated reproducibility digits, nothing else.**
