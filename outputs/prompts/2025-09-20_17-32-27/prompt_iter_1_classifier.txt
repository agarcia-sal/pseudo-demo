Given the following pseudocode, analyze whether it contains sufficient detail, logical consistency, and completeness to be implemented and pass all unit tests reliably. Consider clarity of algorithm steps, handling of edge cases, absence of ambiguity, and clear input-output definition.  
Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (i.e., can be implemented to pass all unit tests), otherwise output **0**.  
Do not output anything else.
