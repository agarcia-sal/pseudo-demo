Given one or more pseudocode inputs describing algorithmic solutions, independently evaluate each input and output a single digit `1` or `0` per input, concatenated in order without any spaces, newlines, or extra characters. The output digit for each pseudocode must be:

- `1` if and only if the pseudocode is **fully reproducible** — meaning it is **completely explicit, unambiguous, and self-contained** such that a direct line-by-line implementation will deterministically pass **all valid unit tests** including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases **without requiring any inference, external knowledge, or supplementation**.

- `0` if there is **any ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumption, missing detail, external dependency, contradictory logic, undefined behavior, or incomplete edge/error case handling** that prevents guaranteed full unit test passage.

---

### Detailed Evaluation Guidelines (all below must be satisfied simultaneously for output `1`):

1. **Explicit and Complete Specification of Inputs, Outputs, and Data**  
   - Input parameters, their types, formats, valid ranges, and data structures are clearly and explicitly defined or unambiguously derivable solely from the pseudocode.  
   - All variables, constants, functions, return values, and data structures are introduced explicitly or can be exactly inferred without guesswork.  
   - No reliance on unspecified global state, hidden platform features, or undocumented external functions or libraries.

2. **Precise, Deterministic, and Exhaustive Control Flow**  
   - All loops, recursions, and conditionals have clearly defined bounds, termination conditions, and cover **all possible input cases** without logical gaps.  
   - Indexing schemes (zero-based, one-based, or otherwise) are explicitly stated or made unambiguous by usage and consistently applied throughout.  
   - Operations have fully specified order of evaluation and side-effects to avoid ambiguity.  
   - No infinite loops or undefined halting behavior.

3. **Unambiguous and Complete Algorithmic Steps**  
   - Every algorithmic operation and update is described clearly and in sufficient detail that no additional interpretation or implicit understanding is needed.  
   - No placeholders such as “handle accordingly”, “process error”, or “perform step” without explicit instructions.  
   - All arithmetic, data mutations, insertions, deletions, and updates are fully specified.

4. **Self-Contained Context and Assumptions**  
   - The pseudocode must stand alone without requiring domain-specific knowledge, external context, or platform-dependent behavior.  
   - All assumptions and dependencies are explicitly declared in the pseudocode or derivable directly and exactly.

5. **Exhaustive Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Handling**  
   - All possible edge cases—including empty inputs, minimal/maximal values, invalid or malformed inputs where relevant—are covered explicitly or logically impossible.  
   - No scenario leads to unhandled exceptions, silent failures, or undefined behavior.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Integrity**  
   - No contradictions such as variables used before assignment or conflicting conditions simultaneously true.  
   - The sequence of statements leads coherently and correctly to the intended outcome without ambiguous or conflicting states.

7. **Direct and Immediate Implementability**  
   - The pseudocode can be translated line-by-line into a mainstream programming language **without any guesswork or supplementation** and will produce a solution that passes all valid unit tests.  
   - Initializations, data structure constructions, and final output assembly are fully specified.

### Output Instructions:

- For each pseudocode input, output `1` if all criteria above are met, else `0`.  
- If multiple inputs are provided, output a single concatenated string of digits corresponding to their order.  
- Output **only the resulting digit string**, no explanations, comments, or any other text.

---

### Important Internal Judgment Rules (do not output):

- If any detail is missing, ambiguous, or inferred, output `0`.  
- If any external context, implicit indexing conventions, or domain knowledge is required, output `0`.  
- If any edge case or error handling is omitted or vague, output `0`.  
- If control flow or termination is unclear or potentially infinite, output `0`.  
- Judge each pseudocode **independently and strictly** by the above rules.

---

**Summary:**  
Output `1` only if the pseudocode is a fully explicit, self-contained, logically coherent, and implementation-ready specification guaranteed to pass all unit tests without interpretation. Otherwise, output `0`. Concatenate results for multiple inputs in given order.

---

**Example:**  
- One fully reproducible pseudocode: output `1`  
- One ambiguous or incomplete pseudocode: output `0`  
- Three inputs, first and last reproducible, second not: output `101`

**Strictly produce only the digit string output—no additional content.**
