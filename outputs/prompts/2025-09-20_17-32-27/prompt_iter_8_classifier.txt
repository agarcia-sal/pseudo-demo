Given one or more pseudocode inputs, determine for each a strict binary label indicating whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be implemented **exactly as specified without any assumptions or missing details** and will pass **all valid unit tests**, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional inputs.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit:  
- `1` if and only if the pseudocode **unambiguously, completely, and deterministically** specifies all necessary components to guarantee correct execution and passing of all unit tests.  
- `0` otherwise.

Your decision must be based solely on the pseudocode as given, **without interpreting or filling gaps by external knowledge or inference**.

### Rigorous criteria for assigning `1` (fully reproducible):

1. **Complete Definitions and Explicit Specifications**  
   - All variables, data structures, and helper functions/procedures are fully defined or clearly derivable from the pseudocode itself (including initializations, types, value domains).  
   - Inputs and outputs are specified explicitly, including formats, types, and precise meaning.  
   - No undefined references, implicit external dependencies, or missing intermediate steps.

2. **Precise, Unambiguous Control Flow and Behavior**  
   - All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) specify exact flow and termination criteria; no infinite or unexplained looping is present.  
   - Branching conditions cover all cases without contradiction or omission.  
   - Data indexing, element access, and ordering rules are clearly and consistently described.

3. **Deterministic and Well-Defined Operations**  
   - All computations, updates, and side effects have deterministic, fully described semantics.  
   - No vague or approximative instructions, nor implicit assumptions about order, rounding, or data structure behavior.  
   - Updates to data structures (insertions, removals, assignments) are fully specified, ensuring coherence.

4. **Self-Contained Context Without Implicit Assumptions**  
   - The pseudocode does not rely on any unstated environment, hidden state, or external libraries—everything needed to implement the algorithm is contained or fully described.  
   - No assumptions about platform, language features, or built-in functions beyond what the pseudocode defines.

5. **Explicit Handling or Logical Guarantee of All Edge and Exceptional Cases**  
   - Boundary conditions, empty inputs, extreme values, and error/exception cases are explicitly addressed or are logically impossible given the pseudocode’s structure.  
   - No possible undefined or erroneous behavior for any valid input.

6. **Logical Consistency and Correctness Alignment**  
   - Variables are never used before assignment, no internal contradictions exist.  
   - Data flow and transformations are coherent and correspond to the stated problem intent or algorithmic purpose.  
   - The design ensures all subtasks required for correctness are implemented.

### Output Format:

- When multiple pseudocodes are provided as input in sequence, output a single string of digits (`1` or `0`), one digit per pseudocode input, **in that exact order**.  
- Output must contain only these digits, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other characters.  
- Make a strict binary classification — partial correctness, ambiguous pseudocode, or plausible-but-incomplete reasoning must yield output `0`.

---

### Additional instructions for evaluation:

- Assume no external information beyond the presented pseudocode.  
- Avoid crediting “likely correct” or “mostly complete” pseudocode; all criteria must be fully satisfied to output `1`.  
- Prioritize formal, constructive verification of completeness, determinism, self-containment, and robustness.  
- Reject any pseudocode exhibiting: missing definitions, ambiguous operations, implicit dependencies, unspecified edge cases, or logical contradictions.

---

**Examples:**  
- Input contains one reproducible pseudocode → Output: `1`  
- Input contains one non-reproducible pseudocode → Output: `0`  
- Input contains three pseudocodes, first reproducible, second not, third reproducible → Output: `101`

---

**Remember:** The output string’s length always equals the number of pseudocode inputs and strictly consists of `1`s and `0`s.
