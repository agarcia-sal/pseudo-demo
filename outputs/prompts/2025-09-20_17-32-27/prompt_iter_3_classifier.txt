Given the input pseudocode(s), determine whether each pseudocode is **fully reproducible**—meaning it provides a **complete, precise, logically sound, and self-contained algorithm** that can be directly and unambiguously implemented to pass **all valid unit tests**, including edge cases and boundary conditions.

To decide reproducibility, rigorously verify the following for each pseudocode:

1. **Explicitness and completeness**: Every variable, function, data structure, and step is clearly defined with no missing parts or gaps; no undefined references.

2. **Logical coherence**: Control flow and algorithm logic are consistent and free of contradictions or ambiguous branches.

3. **Deterministic implementability**: All operations, conditions, loops, and assignments are unambiguously described—implementers do not need to guess or fill in missing information.

4. **Comprehensive edge case coverage**: The pseudocode explicitly or implicitly handles boundary cases, minimal/empty inputs, and exceptional scenarios to ensure robustness.

5. **Input/output clarity**: Input parameters and expected outputs are sufficiently specified or derivable, allowing direct testing.

6. **Self-contained**: The pseudocode does not rely on unstated assumptions, external data, or context beyond what is provided.

**Your task**: For each pseudocode submitted in sequence, output a single digit:

- **1** if all of the above criteria are met, i.e., the pseudocode is reproducible to pass all unit tests reliably;  
- **0** otherwise.

**Important instructions:**  
- Output only the digits (1 or 0) concatenated in exact input order, with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or extra text.  
- Assume no external knowledge beyond the pseudocode given.  
- Make no probabilistic or partial judgments—only output 1 if fully reproducible, else 0.

**Example outputs:**  
`1`  
`0`  
`101` (for three inputs fed sequentially)

Your output must be terse, precise, and strictly adhere to the format above.
