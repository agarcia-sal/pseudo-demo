Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to determine for each whether it is **completely reproducible**, meaning it can be implemented with exact fidelity and will pass **all valid unit tests**—covering normal, edge, boundary, and exceptional cases—without requiring any assumptions, inference, or external information.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit:  
- **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets every requirement below and is fully sufficient to guarantee correctness and reproducibility,  
- **0** otherwise.

### Definitive Reproducibility Requirements (All must be strictly satisfied):

1. **Terminology and Declarations**  
   - All variables, parameters, data structures, functions, and constants used are clearly introduced and defined, or fully derivable from context.  
   - Input/output specifications (types, format, structure) and expected return values are stated explicitly or unambiguously inferable.  
   - No use of undefined helper routines, libraries, global or external states not described within or alongside the pseudocode.

2. **Complete, Unambiguous Logic and Control Flow**  
   - Control constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion) are fully described with precise conditions governing entry, continuation, exit, and termination—no infinite or unexplained halting behavior.  
   - Branching covers all possible cases exhaustively, leaving no logical gaps or contradictions that would force guesswork.  
   - Every line or operation contributes clearly to the program's logic; ambiguous or underspecified instructions are disallowed.

3. **Deterministic and Exact Operations**  
   - All computations, state changes, data access (including indexing), and side effects are fully spelled out with concrete, unambiguous semantics.  
   - Use of operations, indexing conventions, and data manipulations adhere to consistent, standard logic that can be implemented without additional interpretation.  
   - No vague terms like “process accordingly” or “do something” without precise algorithmic detail.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Free**  
   - The pseudocode’s correctness does not depend on prior knowledge, external environment, hidden assumptions, or any data not provided explicitly within the pseudocode.  
   - No implicit knowledge about platform, language, or libraries is required beyond what is enumerated.

5. **Exhaustive Edge Case and Error Condition Handling**  
   - Boundary, minimal, empty, malformed, or exceptional inputs are either explicitly handled or logically impossible due to the pseudocode’s structure.  
   - No undefined behaviors or silent failures occur for any valid input within the stated domain.

6. **Logical and Semantic Coherence**  
   - No contradictions (e.g., variables used before assignment, mutually exclusive conditions assumed true simultaneously).  
   - The algorithm’s described steps align coherently with the stated goals, ensuring correctness.  
   - Data structure modifications and accesses maintain internal consistency, no race or conflict is left ambiguous.

7. **Readiness for Direct Implementation**  
   - The pseudocode is ready for a direct, line-by-line or stepwise implementation in a concrete programming language without requiring interpretation, supplementation, or guesswork.  
   - All iteration initializations, index ranges, termination conditions, and result constructions are fully detailed.

### Output Instructions:

- When multiple pseudocodes are provided one after another, output a single string of digits with no spaces, line breaks, or other characters.  
- The digits correspond in order to the pseudocodes given.  
- For each pseudocode, output:  
  - `1` if fully reproducible per the above criteria,  
  - `0` if not.  
- Do not output explanations, partial scores, or commentary—only the concatenated string of 1s and 0s.

---

### Additional Clarifications (Do not output these):

- Any implied or “likely correct if assumed” should be scored as `0`.  
- Precision, completeness, and explicitness take absolute precedence over coding style.  
- Treat any reliance on subject matter knowledge beyond the pseudocode’s explicit content as grounds for `0`.  
- Infinite loops or ambiguous termination cases are unacceptable.  
- Missing edge case coverage or unclear error treatment causes rejection.  
- Multiple pseudocodes may differ widely in structure or style; evaluate each independently against the requirements.

---

### Summary

The goal is to identify only those pseudocodes that can be translated into a fully functioning program guaranteed to pass **all valid unit tests without additional input or assumptions**. To be scored `1`, a pseudocode must be fully self-sufficient, explicit, unambiguous, logically flawless, and ready for direct implementation.

---

**Examples:**  
- Input with one fully specified pseudocode: output `1`  
- Input with one incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode: output `0`  
- Input with three pseudocodes, first and third reproducible, second not: output `101`

**Strict binary decision only.**
