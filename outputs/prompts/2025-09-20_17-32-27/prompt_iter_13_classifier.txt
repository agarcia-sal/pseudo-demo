Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to output a single digit per pseudocode—`1` if it is **fully reproducible** and guaranteed to pass **all valid unit tests**, or `0` otherwise.

**Reproducible** means the pseudocode can be implemented exactly as given without any guesswork, supplemental assumptions, or missing details, such that the resulting implementation will pass every unit test covering normal cases, edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional inputs.

### Evaluation Criteria (Every item below must be strictly met for output 1):

1. **Explicit Definitions and Interfaces**  
   - All variables, parameters, constants, data structures, and functions are named and defined clearly or fully derivable by context.  
   - All inputs and outputs (types, formats, and expected return values) are specified explicitly or clearly inferable without ambiguity.  
   - No references to undefined functions, external libraries, or global/environment state unless fully detailed.

2. **Unambiguous, Complete Control Flow and Logic**  
   - All control constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion, breaks, continues) are fully and precisely described including initialization, loop conditions, and termination criteria—no infinite loops or unclear halting.  
   - All decision branches together cover every possible input and state, leaving **no logical gaps, contradictions, or unresolved paths**.  
   - No vague terms or instructions; every operation, condition, and step must be clearly specified.

3. **Deterministic and Precise Operations**  
   - Every operation’s semantics is exact (e.g., indexing conventions, arithmetic, substring extraction, comparisons).  
   - There is no room for multiple interpretations—phrases like “process accordingly,” “handle as needed,” or “do something” cause failure.  
   - Intermediate states, mutations, and side effects are fully described.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The pseudocode includes everything necessary for correctness and does not rely on any external knowledge outside what is provided.  
   - No implicit assumptions about programming language, platform, environment, or hidden context allowed.

5. **Comprehensive Edge and Error Case Handling**  
   - All boundary conditions (empty inputs, minimal and maximal values, malformed data) are either explicitly handled or logically impossible due to the pseudocode’s specifications.  
   - The pseudocode cannot produce undefined, silent, or erroneous behaviors under valid inputs.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Coherence**  
   - No contradictions (e.g., variable used before assignment, conflicting conditions).  
   - The pseudocode’s structure and logic align with the stated goals and output.  
   - Data structure accesses and updates maintain internal integrity throughout.

7. **Directly Implementable Without Interpretation**  
   - The pseudocode is ready for a line-by-line mechanical translation into an executable program without guesswork or supplements.  
   - All iteration initialization, indexing, termination conditions, and output assembly steps are explicitly described.

### Output Instructions:

- For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit:  
  - `1` if it is fully reproducible by the above definition,  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- If multiple pseudocodes are input sequentially, output a concatenated string of digits in the same order, with **no spaces, no line breaks, no extra characters**.  
- Output absolutely **nothing else** (no commentary, no partial credit, no explanations).

---

### Important Considerations (Implicit and do not output):

- Any requirement to infer, guess, or supply missing logic must result in `0`.  
- Precision and completeness override style or brevity.  
- Infinite loops or ambiguous termination always cause `0`.  
- Missing or unclear edge case handling causes `0`.  
- Each pseudocode is evaluated completely and independently from others, regardless of style differences.

---

**Summary:**  
Only produce `1` when the pseudocode is fully explicit, self-contained, logically flawless, and ready for direct, unambiguous implementation guaranteed to satisfy all unit tests in any reasonable test suite. Otherwise, output `0`.

---

**Examples:**  
- One fully defined pseudocode → output `1`  
- One incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output `0`  
- Three pseudocodes, reproducible, not reproducible, reproducible → output `101`

**Strict binary output only. No explanations, no extra output.**
