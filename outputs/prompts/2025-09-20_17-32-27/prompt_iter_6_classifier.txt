Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to determine for each whether it is **fully reproducible**, i.e., can be implemented exactly as given to pass **all valid unit tests** including all edge, boundary, and exceptional cases, with zero ambiguity or need for assumptions.

For each pseudocode, output **1** if and only if **all** the following conditions are strictly met; otherwise output **0**:

### Criteria for fully reproducible pseudocode:

1. **Explicit completeness**  
   - Every element (variables, data structures, functions, procedures) is defined or clearly derivable without guesswork.  
   - Input and output specifications are explicit, including types, formats, and expected behavior.  
   - No references to undefined or partially defined entities, including helper functions or external dependencies.

2. **Unambiguous control flow and logic**  
   - All loops, conditionals, and recursion are fully and clearly described so they dictate one precise flow.  
   - Any branching logic is explicitly specified with all conditions covered (no gaps or contradictions).  
   - No unreachable or infinite loops without termination or exit criteria.

3. **Deterministic and precise operations**  
   - All computations, state mutations, and side effects are clearly defined so a correct implementation follows naturally from the pseudocode.  
   - No vague instructions, ambiguous operators, or loosely defined expressions remain.  
   - Indexing, orderings, and element references are concrete and consistent.

4. **Self-contained context**  
   - The pseudocode does not depend on any external environment, dataset, or assumptions outside what is provided.  
   - No reliance on any unprovided libraries, global state, or prior knowledge beyond what is fully explained.

5. **Robust edge case and error handling**  
   - Boundary conditions, minimal/empty inputs, and exceptional cases are explicitly handled or logically guaranteed by the pseudocode’s structure.  
   - No undefined behavior for special cases or inputs.

6. **Logical consistency and correctness**  
   - No contradictions, semantic conflicts, or variables used before assignment.  
   - The algorithm’s purpose and steps align correctly for the intended output.  
   - Data structure manipulations (insertions, removals, updates) are coherent and do not cause ambiguities.

### Output instructions:  
- When multiple pseudocode inputs are given in a sequence, output a single string of digits, one per input, in the given order.  
- For each pseudocode, output:  
  - `1` if it meets **all** the above criteria, i.e., fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all valid unit tests,  
  - Otherwise, `0`.  
- Output only the concatenated digits with no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other characters.

Make strict binary decisions; partial reproducibility or probable correctness must be scored as 0.

Assume **no external information** beyond what the pseudocode presents.

**Example outputs:**  
`1`  
`0`  
`101` (for three pseudocodes in input order)

---

**Additional guidance (implicit, no output needed):**  
- Prioritize clarity and completeness over surface syntax or style.  
- Ensure all necessary algorithmic details are spelled out, including initialization, loop invariants, and termination.  
- Carefully detect any missing edge case handling or implicit assumptions.  
- Avoid granting credit for “likely correct” or “could be implemented correctly with minor assumptions.”  
- Treat any ambiguity, missing detail, or hidden dependency as non-reproducible.
