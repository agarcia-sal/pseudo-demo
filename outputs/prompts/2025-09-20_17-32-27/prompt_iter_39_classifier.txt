Evaluate each given pseudocode input independently and output a single digit per input as follows:

**Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode is fully reproducible,** meaning it contains a complete, unambiguous, and precise description allowing a direct line-by-line implementation to pass **all valid unit tests** (normal, edge, boundary, error cases) without any guesswork, supplementation, or external assumptions.

Otherwise, **output `0`.**

Concatenate all digits in input order into one uninterrupted string of digits (no spaces, newlines, or other characters).

### Strict standards for reproducibility (all must be met without exception):

1. **Explicit, Complete Declarations**  
   Every variable, parameter, data structure, function, and constant is either explicitly declared or fully inferable without assumptions.  
   Input and output formats, types, and valid value ranges must be unambiguously defined or determinable solely from the pseudocode.  
   No implicit dependencies on external libraries, environment, or hidden global state.

2. **Fully Detailed, Deterministic Logic and Control Flow**  
   All control flow elements (loops, conditionals, recursion) have explicitly stated indexing schemes, boundaries, and termination conditions that guarantee no infinite or undefined loops.  
   All possible input scenarios (including error and corner cases) are explicitly or logically exhaustively handled with no implicit or missing branches.

3. **Precise Operations with Consistent Conventions**  
   Every assignment, arithmetic operation, data mutation, and indexing operation is described with clarity: indexing bases are stated or clearly consistent, all side effects are explicit, and evaluation order is unambiguous.  
   No terms like “handle accordingly” or placeholders implying interpretation or supplemental logic.

4. **Fully Self-Contained and Context-Free**  
   The entire algorithm must be implementable without requiring any external knowledge, platform-specific behavior, or assumptions beyond what the pseudocode itself provides.

5. **Exhaustive Coverage of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   All boundary cases—including empty, minimal, maximum, or malformed inputs (where applicable)—are explicitly treated or logically impossible.  
   The pseudocode does not allow undefined, silent failures, or exceptions for any valid input.

6. **Logical and Semantic Consistency**  
   No internal contradictions, conflicting conditions, or undefined states.  
   Variable states and data structures remain coherent throughout with no use-before-initialization or ambiguous updates.

7. **Implementation-Ready Granularity**  
   The pseudocode is complete enough to translate literally into working code without adding any details, disambiguating assumptions, or external interpretation.

### Output format:

- For each pseudocode input, output either `1` or `0` following rules above.  
- Concatenate all outputs into a single uninterrupted string matching the input order.  
- Output nothing else.

---

### Summary:

**Output `1` only if the pseudocode is guaranteed to produce a correct, fully test-passing implementation with no assumptions or clarifications needed. Output `0` otherwise.**

---

### Example:

- One reproducible pseudocode input → output: `1`  
- One ambiguous or incomplete pseudocode input → output: `0`  
- Three inputs where only the first and third are reproducible → output: `101`

**Strictly do NOT output anything other than the concatenated reproducibility results.**
