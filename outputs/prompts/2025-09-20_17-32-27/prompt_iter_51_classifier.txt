Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently evaluate each to determine if it is **fully reproducible** under the following strict and unified definition:

---

### Definition of Full Reproducibility:

A pseudocode snippet is fully reproducible if it contains **complete, precise, and unambiguous instructions** that allow a developer to implement it **exactly as specified**, guaranteeing that the implementation will **pass all valid unit tests**—including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases—**without any need for external assumptions, interpretations, or supplemental information.**

---

### Evaluation Method:

For each input pseudocode, perform a rigorous check against all the following criteria. If **all criteria** are satisfied, output `1`; if **any criterion** fails, output `0`. Concatenate the outputs for multiple inputs in the order received, with no spaces or additional characters.

---

### Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be strictly met):

1. **Explicit and Complete Declarations**  
   - All variables, parameters, data types, data structures, functions, constants, and return values are explicitly declared or unambiguously inferable *solely* from the pseudocode.  
   - Input and output formats, types, valid ranges, and assumptions are explicit or derivable without reliance on external context.

2. **Deterministic, Precise, and Unambiguous Logic**  
   - Control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion) is clearly defined with explicit ranges, bounds, termination conditions, and loop invariants that guarantee halting.  
   - Branching covers all possible input scenarios exhaustively, with no hidden or implicit cases.  
   - Every operation, assignment, comparison, and update is clearly and fully specified, without vague terms like "handle accordingly," "process later," or "assume valid input" without explicit logic.

3. **Consistent and Conventional Indexing and Syntax**  
   - The indexing scheme (0-based or 1-based) is stated clearly or obvious from usage and consistently maintained throughout.  
   - All references to positions, ranges, and slices are precise, avoiding off-by-one errors or ambiguity.  
   - The order of evaluation of expressions and side effects is well defined or unavoidably deterministic; no partially defined semantics.

4. **Self-Contained and Environment-Neutral**  
   - The pseudocode must stand independently with no hidden dependencies on external libraries, environment states, hardware, or platform-specific features.  
   - Any assumed knowledge or standard functions used must be explicitly defined, or their behavior precisely described in the pseudocode.

5. **Exhaustive Error and Edge Case Handling**  
   - All edge cases (empty inputs, single-element inputs, maximal samples, malformed or boundary invalid inputs where applicable) are either explicitly handled or demonstrated to be impossible within problem constraints.  
   - No inputs should cause silent failure, undefined behavior, infinite loops, or runtime errors.

6. **Logical Coherence and State Consistency**  
   - There are no contradictions, such as variables used before initialization, conflicting conditionals that can both be true, or logically inconsistent states.  
   - Data structures remain consistent and coherent throughout, with no ill-defined or ambiguous transitions.

7. **Direct Implementability Without Assumptions**  
   - The pseudocode can be translated line-by-line into working code in a conventional programming language with no guesswork, supplementation, or inference required.  
   - All intermediate steps, initializations, and result constructions are fully explicit and accurate.

---

### Output Format:

- For **n** pseudocode inputs, output a single string of length **n** composed only of digits `1` or `0`.  
- The *i*th digit corresponds to the *i*th pseudocode input.  
- `1` = fully reproducible; `0` = not fully reproducible.  
- Output **only** this digit string, nothing else—no commentary, explanation, or formatting.

---

### Important Judgment Rules (for internal use only; do not output):

- Any ambiguity, missing detail, or required inference → `0`.  
- Implicit assumptions about indexing, data types, or input format → `0`.  
- Partial or incomplete handling of edge cases → `0`.  
- Reliance on unspecified external knowledge or nonstandard operations → `0`.  
- Potential for infinite loops or undefined termination → `0`.  
- Contradictory or logically inconsistent instructions → `0`.  
- Fully explicit, logically sound pseudocode that accounts for all cases and can be implemented directly → `1`.

---

### Summary:

You must judge each pseudocode snippet purely on whether it is a **complete, unambiguous, implementation-ready algorithm description** guaranteed to pass **all unit tests without external input or assumption**. Output a strict binary vector reflecting reproducibility, with no additional output.

---

**Example:**  
- If given three pseudocode inputs where only the first and last are fully reproducible, output:  
`101`  

**Strictly output only the concatenated digits, nothing else.**
