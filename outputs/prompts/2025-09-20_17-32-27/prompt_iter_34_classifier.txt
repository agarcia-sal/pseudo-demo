Given one or more independent pseudocode inputs, your task is to evaluate each separately and determine whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning it contains **all necessary and precisely stated details** so that a direct implementation will unambiguously and deterministically pass **all valid unit tests** covering normal, edge, boundary, and error cases with no exception.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit with no spaces, punctuation, or line breaks:  
- Output **1** if the pseudocode is complete, explicit, and fully unambiguous, allowing it to be implemented directly without any need for interpretation, inference, supplementation, or external assumptions, ensuring it passes every valid test case,  
- Output **0** otherwise (if it has any ambiguity, missing definitions, unstated assumptions, incomplete edge case handling, unclear or non-terminating logic, or relies on context beyond what is stated).

### Precise Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be satisfied simultaneously):

1. **Fully Explicit and Complete Definitions**  
   - Every variable, parameter, function, data structure, constant, and output is introduced or clearly derivable solely from the pseudocode, with no undeclared elements or external dependencies.  
   - Inputs and outputs, including their types, formats, ranges, and structures, are clearly given or logically inferable without outside knowledge.

2. **Unambiguous, Exhaustive, and Deterministic Logic and Control Flow**  
   - All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) have fully specified bounds, iteration steps, and termination criteria, guaranteeing no infinite loops or undefined stopping points.  
   - Every case and branch is explicitly handled by the pseudocode; no input scenario leads to unspecified behavior or is implicitly assumed.  
   - Operations and instructions are described concretely, with no vague terms like “handle errors” without concrete algorithms or “process accordingly” without details.

3. **Consistent and Precise Operational Semantics**  
   - All data accesses, indexing (including whether zero- or one-based), mutations, and computations have explicitly stated conventions and unambiguous evaluation order.  
   - No conflicting or contradictory instructions (e.g., variables used before initialization, contradictory states) are present.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence from External Context**  
   - The pseudocode can be implemented and executed entirely as given without requiring domain knowledge, platform-specific behavior, or hidden assumptions beyond the declared inputs and outputs.  
   - Any assumptions about environment, runtime, or libraries must be explicitly stated within the pseudocode itself.

5. **Complete Handling of All Edge, Boundary, and Error Conditions**  
   - Edge cases including empty inputs, minimal and maximal valid values, and malformed inputs (if applicable) are explicitly addressed or logically impossible within the problem space.  
   - No possible input leads to undefined, silent failures, or errors.

6. **Logical Coherence and Semantic Integrity**  
   - The algorithm steps form a logically sound and internally consistent approach toward the stated goal, with no contradictory states or ambiguous intermediate outcomes.

7. **Direct, Line-by-Line Implementability Without Interpretation**  
   - The pseudocode specifies initializations, loop ranges, index manipulations, condition checks, and result constructions sufficiently precisely so that a direct line-by-line translation into any conventional programming language is possible without guessing or adding unstated details.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single uninterrupted string of digits (`1` or `0`) with no additional characters, spaces, or line breaks.  
- Digits correspond in exact input order.  
- Output only the resulting string of digits, nothing else—no explanations, partial scores, or comments.

---

### Important Evaluation Notes (for internal judgment, do **not** output):

- If any assumption, inference, or external supplementation is necessary to fully understand or implement the pseudocode, output `0`.  
- If any ambiguity exists in control flow, variable usage, indexing, or edge case handling, output `0`.  
- If termination conditions might be incomplete or infinite loops possible, output `0`.  
- If any reliance on unstated platform, language, or environment detail is required, output `0`.  
- Each pseudocode input must be judged completely independently of the others under these strict rules.

---

### Summary:  
Only output `1` for pseudocode inputs that are fully explicit, exhaustive, unambiguous, self-contained, and immediately implementable to pass **all** valid unit tests **without any outside intervention or guessing**. Otherwise, output `0`. Your final output is therefore a strict binary string reflecting reproducibility for the input pseudocodes in order.

**Example outputs:**  
- One fully reproducible pseudocode input → output: `1`  
- One incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode input → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocode inputs where the first and third are reproducible and the second is not → output: `101`

**Strictly produce no output beyond the concatenated string of reproducibility digits.**
