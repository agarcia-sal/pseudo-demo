Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently evaluate each for **complete, unambiguous, and fully precise implementability** that guarantees passing **all** valid unit tests—including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases—without any need for external assumptions, interpretation, or supplementation.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit (concatenated in input order, with no spaces, punctuation, or extra characters):  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is strictly reproducible—meaning it can be translated line-by-line into a working implementation that passes all unit tests with no ambiguity, missing details, or hidden dependencies,  
- Output **0** otherwise.

---

### Reproducibility Requirements (all must be fully satisfied):

1. **Explicit and Fully Specified Interfaces and Data**  
   - Every variable, parameter, data structure, constant, and function is explicitly declared or clearly and unambiguously inferable solely from the pseudocode.  
   - Input and output formats, types, valid ranges, and structures are completely defined without requiring external knowledge or assumptions.  
   - No references to undefined or implicitly available global variables, libraries, or external APIs.

2. **Clear, Complete, and Deterministic Control Flow**  
   - All loops, recursion, conditionals, and iterations have fully specified boundaries, initializations, and exit conditions, preventing infinite loops or undefined termination behavior.  
   - Branching and conditional logic exhaustively cover all possible inputs, with no unspecified or implicit cases.  
   - Every computational step is concretely defined; no vague instructions, implicit error handling, or placeholders are allowed.

3. **Precise and Consistent Operations**  
   - Every data manipulation, indexing scheme, arithmetic operation, and side effect is described exactly with consistent conventions (e.g., indexing base and order explicitly clarified or unambiguously maintained).  
   - No underspecification in the order of evaluation, mutations, or state changes.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Free**  
   - No hidden dependencies on environment, platform, or prior knowledge outside the pseudocode and its input/output definition.  
   - All assumptions and preconditions must be explicitly stated or unambiguously derivable within the pseudocode itself.

5. **Complete Coverage of Edge and Error Cases**  
   - All boundary, minimal, maximal, empty, and exceptional inputs are either explicitly handled or logically impossible given the declared input domain.  
   - No input can cause undefined behavior, silent failures, or exceptions.

6. **Logical Soundness and Internal Consistency**  
   - No contradictions, use-before-assignment, or conflicting state updates are present.  
   - Steps logically progress toward solving the stated problem; intermediate states remain coherent and data structures consistent throughout.

7. **Ready for Direct Implementation**  
   - The pseudocode provides **all** details needed to be ported directly into code without introducing assumptions, guesses, or added detail.  
   - Index ranges, variable initializations, iterations, return values, and updates are fully enumerated.

---

### Output Rules:

- Process each pseudocode input independently and in order.  
- Output a single concatenated string of digits, one digit per input: `1` = reproducible, `0` = not reproducible.  
- Output **only** the digit string; no commentary, explanation, spaces, newlines, or extraneous text.

---

### Judgment Guidelines (for internal reasoning only, do NOT output):

- Any missing explicit detail, ambiguity, or need for assumption → output `0`.  
- Any unspecified input/output formats, ranges, or variable declarations → output `0`.  
- Implicit or vague logic, incomplete control flow or branches → output `0`.  
- Reliance on unstated external context, environment, or language features → output `0`.  
- Infinite loops or undefined termination → output `0`.  
- Contradictions or logical errors → output `0`.  
- Only if the pseudocode meets every above requirement exactly → output `1`.

---

### Summary:

Concisely judge whether, **without any additional interpretation or supplementation**, the pseudocode is fully implementable and guaranteed to pass all valid unit tests. Output `1` for such reproducible pseudocode, otherwise `0`. Return only the concatenated digit string representing reproducibility for all inputs in their original order.

---

**Example:**  
- Single reproducible pseudocode input → output: `1`  
- Single incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocode inputs where 1st and 3rd reproducible, 2nd not → output: `101`

---

**Strictly no additional output besides the concatenated reproducibility digits.**
