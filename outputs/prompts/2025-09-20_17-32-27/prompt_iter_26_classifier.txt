Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to independently assess each for **strict full reproducibility** such that the pseudocode can be directly and unambiguously implemented as given, requiring no interpretation, assumptions, or external knowledge, and would unquestionably pass **all valid unit tests**, including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases.

For each input pseudocode, output exactly one digit in a continuous sequence with no spaces or extra characters:  
- Output **1** only if the pseudocode meets *all* criteria listed below without exception, guaranteeing flawless direct implementation and behavior.  
- Output **0** otherwise (if there is *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, missing detail, or dependence on external/implicit context).

---

### Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be strictly and cumulatively satisfied):

1. **Explicit and Complete Specification**  
   - All variables, parameters, data structures, function signatures, constants, and return values are fully defined or trivially deducible solely from the pseudocode text without assumption.  
   - Inputs and outputs have unambiguous types, valid value ranges, and data formats explicitly stated or inherently clear.  
   - No references to undeclared external libraries, functions, hidden states, or global/environmental variables.

2. **Deterministic, Total, and Precise Control Flow**  
   - Every control structure (loops, recursion, conditionals) clearly defines all indices, boundaries, iteration counts, and termination conditions, explicitly precluding infinite loops or partial traversals.  
   - Branching covers every logically possible case exhaustively—no gaps, no implicit “else” that requires guesswork.  
   - No vague, placeholder, or underspecified algorithmic steps (e.g., “handle accordingly”, “process errors”) without exact procedural detail.

3. **Concrete and Unambiguous Operations**  
   - Every operation (arithmetic, indexing, assignments, data mutations) is explicitly defined with clear semantics and consistent conventions (such as zero- or one-based indexing clearly stated and strictly maintained).  
   - No underdetermined evaluation order, unspecified side effects, or ambiguous state changes.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Free**  
   - The entire solution, including initialization, helper functions, and utility logic, is fully enclosed within the pseudocode, without any required external domain knowledge, undefined environmental assumptions, or platform-specific behaviors.  
   - Any dependency or assumption outside the given pseudocode text invalidates reproducibility.

5. **Complete Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Conditions**  
   - All plausible edge cases (empty inputs, minimal/maximal input sizes or values, invalid/malformed inputs if applicable) are explicitly handled or logically impossible.  
   - No paths yield undefined, erroneous, silent failures or incomplete processing for any allowed input.

6. **Logical Consistency and Internal Coherence**  
   - No contradictions exist (e.g., variables used before initialization, mutually exclusive conditions assumed true simultaneously).  
   - State transitions and data integrity are consistently maintained throughout the flow.

7. **Direct Line-by-Line Implementability Without Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode can be converted verbatim into working code in a standard language, without any need for interpretation, assumption, or addition.  
   - All indices, initial states, iterations, updates, and final output constructions must be explicitly delineated.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple inputs, output a single, uninterrupted string of digits corresponding one-to-one to inputs in the order provided.  
- Output **only** these digits, no whitespace, punctuation, or commentary of any kind.  
- For each input, output `1` if fully reproducible per above; otherwise, output `0`.

---

### Important Internal Judgment Notes (do not output):

- Any reliance on assumptions, implicit interpretation, or missing definitions → output `0`.  
- Any ambiguity, missing edge case coverage, or vague instructions → output `0`.  
- Any external or platform/environment-dependent information → `0`.  
- Infinite or undefined control flows or partial coverage → `0`.  
- Logical contradictions or incomplete state handling → `0`.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` **only** if the pseudocode unambiguously and exhaustively specifies every element needed to implement and pass every valid test without any interpretation. In all other cases, output `0`.  
The output is a strict, order-preserving binary vector representing reproducibility of each input.

---

**Example outputs:**  
- Single fully reproducible pseudocode input → `1`  
- Single non-reproducible pseudocode input → `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first and third are reproducible, second is not → `101`

**Strictly output only the concatenated reproducibility digits with no extra text.**
