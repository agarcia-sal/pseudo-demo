Given one or more pseudocode inputs, evaluate each independently to determine whether it is strictly **fully reproducible**—meaning that the pseudocode, as provided, is comprehensive, unambiguous, and explicit enough to be implemented directly *without any assumptions or external information* and will pass **all valid unit tests** (including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) unequivocally.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit (`1` or `0`), concatenated without any spaces, line breaks, or extra characters, in the exact order the inputs are given:  
- Output `1` if and only if the entire pseudocode satisfies every condition below, guaranteeing a direct implementation will certainly pass all tests,  
- Otherwise, output `0`.

### Comprehensive and Strict Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be satisfied):

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, and functions are clearly named and fully defined, including types, expected formats, valid ranges, and constraints.  
   - Any constants or literals used are either defined or are universally recognizable without contextual assumptions.  
   - No references to undeclared entities, external libraries, or hidden global states.

2. **Unambiguous and Exhaustive Control Flow**  
   - All loops, conditionals, and recursive calls have precisely defined control variables, boundaries, termination conditions, and exhaustively cover all input scenarios with no implicit or “default” branches.  
   - The pseudocode explicitly details all decision-making steps — no vague or placeholder statements (e.g., “handle errors,” “process accordingly”) without exact procedural or algorithmic guidance.  
   - No logical contradictions or unaddressed cases exist.

3. **Precise and Deterministic Operations**  
   - Every computation step (arithmetic, indexing, assignments, mutations) is fully specified with clear semantics and consistent conventions (e.g., zero-based or one-based indexing explicitly stated or unambiguously evident and maintained).  
   - There are no ambiguous evaluation orders, side effects, or implicitly inferred behaviors.  
   - Any data mutation or state update must be explicit and stated in detail.

4. **Self-Contained with Zero External Assumptions**  
   - The pseudocode must be fully context-independent, needing no outside domain knowledge, platform-specific quirks, or environmental assumptions beyond what is presented.  
   - Any necessary assumptions or constraints must be explicitly stated in the pseudocode text.

5. **Explicit Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - All potential edge cases, including empty inputs, minimal or maximal values, special or malformed inputs, and error conditions are explicitly handled or logically impossible.  
   - The logic forbids undefined behaviors, infinite loops, or silent failures for any valid input per the stated input domain.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Coherence**  
   - Variables and data are never used before initialization, states remain consistent through all steps, and conditions do not conflict or overlap ambiguously.  
   - The pseudocode’s flow advances logically and coherently toward achieving the stated functional goal.

7. **Direct Implementability Without Interpretation or Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode can be mechanically translated line-by-line into executable code with no guesswork, external assumptions, or added inference.  
   - All control structures, variable initializations, updates, and outputs are fully specified.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single uninterrupted string of digits (`1` or `0`), in the exact order the inputs were fed.  
- Each digit corresponds exactly to one pseudocode input evaluation.  
- Output nothing else: no whitespace, no explanations, no partial or probabilistic indications, no comments.

---

### Important Internal Decision Rules (do not output):

- **Any ambiguity, missing explicit detail, or reliance on assumptions results in a `0`.**  
- Undefined loops, unstated termination conditions, incomplete case coverage, or vague operations yield `0`.  
- Dependence on external context, hidden knowledge, or platform-specific behavior disqualifies reproducibility (`0`).  
- Fully thorough, explicit, logically complete pseudocode per all criteria must yield `1`.  

---

### Summary:

Only output `1` for inputs that are perfectly specified and reproducible, guaranteeing a direct implementation will pass **all** valid unit tests without any further interpretation. Otherwise, output `0`.

---

### Example:

- Single fully reproducible pseudocode input: output `1`  
- Single pseudocode that lacks completeness or has ambiguity: output `0`  
- Three pseudocodes with only first and last fully reproducible: output `101`

---

**Strictly output only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s, nothing else.**
