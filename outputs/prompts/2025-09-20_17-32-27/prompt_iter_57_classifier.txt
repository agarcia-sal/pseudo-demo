Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently analyze each to determine if it is **fully reproducible**: that is, it can be straightforwardly implemented exactly as given, without any ambiguity, omissions, or need for external assumptions or domain knowledge, and guaranteed to pass **all valid unit tests** covering normal, edge, boundary, and error cases.

---

**For each pseudocode input, output a single digit (concatenated in input order, with no spaces or other characters):**  
- Output `1` if it is fully reproducible under the criteria below.  
- Output `0` if it fails any criterion, including but not limited to missing details, ambiguity, under-specification, implicit assumptions, undefined behavior, or incomplete edge case handling.

---

### Enhanced Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be strictly met):

1. **Complete, Explicit, and Self-Contained Specification**  
   - All variables, parameters, data types, data structures, functions, constants, initial values, and return types are either explicitly declared or fully and logically derivable with no assumptions.  
   - Inputs and outputs must have clearly defined types, formats, and valid ranges. Implicit assumptions about inputs or environment are disallowed.  
   - No reliance on any external code, libraries, global state, or hidden context beyond the pseudocode and its stated inputs/outputs.

2. **Precise, Unambiguous, and Exhaustive Control Flow and Logic**  
   - All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) have well-defined, non-ambiguous boundaries, conditions, and termination criteria precluding infinite loops or incomplete cases.  
   - Branches and conditionals exhaustively cover all logically possible inputs or states; every possible path is clearly addressed or logically impossible.  
   - Ambiguous or vague instructions (e.g., “handle errors”, “process accordingly”, “update”) are unacceptable without exact computational meaning and explicit procedural detail.

3. **Deterministic and Well-Defined Operations**  
   - Every operation (arithmetic, indexing, data mutation, state update) is described so its behavior, side effects, and evaluation order are fully predictable without ambiguity.  
   - Indexing conventions (0-based or 1-based) must be explicitly stated or absolutely unambiguous and used consistently throughout.  
   - No underspecification of evaluation order, side effects, or data dependencies is allowed.

4. **Explicit and Exhaustive Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - The pseudocode explicitly handles all relevant edge and boundary inputs (empty inputs, single elements, maximum sizes, malformed or invalid inputs where applicable).  
   - If certain inputs or errors are impossible, this must be clearly stated or evident without assumption.  
   - No possibility of silent failures, undefined states, or unchecked error conditions.

5. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Coherence**  
   - No contradictions or logical conflicts (e.g., using uninitialized variables, mutually exclusive conditions marked true simultaneously, inconsistent state updates).  
   - Data structures and state transitions maintain integrity at every step toward the stated goal.

6. **Implementation-Ready Without Interpretation**  
   - The pseudocode is fully descriptive so it can be translated line-by-line into any standard programming language without addition, inference, or guesswork.  
   - All indexing ranges, initializations, loop invariants, recursions, and result constructions must be spelled out in detail sufficient for direct coding.

---

### Output Format:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, produce exactly one uninterrupted string of digits (no spaces, line breaks, or punctuation).  
- Each digit corresponds in order to each input pseudocode: `1` for fully reproducible, `0` otherwise.  
- Output only this digit string, nothing else. No explanations, intermediate results, or formatting.

---

### Internal Judgment Notes (do not output):  

- If any assumption, inference, or supplementation is needed to implement the pseudocode, output `0`.  
- Ambiguity, missing rigorous detail, or incomplete edge case coverage necessitates `0`.  
- Reliance on unstated environmental knowledge, platform behavior, or hidden state mandates `0`.  
- Infinite or undefined loops or incomplete logical branching require `0`.  
- Judgments are strictly binary per the criteria above.

---

### Summary:

This evaluation strictly determines if the pseudocode is a turnkey, error-free blueprint guaranteed to pass all valid unit tests—refusing any pseudocode that demands interpretation, guesswork, or extra knowledge beyond what is explicitly provided.

**Example outputs:**  
- A single fully reproducible pseudocode → output: `1`  
- A single incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first and third are reproducible, second is not → output: `101`

**Strictly output only the concatenated reproducibility digits string and nothing else.**
