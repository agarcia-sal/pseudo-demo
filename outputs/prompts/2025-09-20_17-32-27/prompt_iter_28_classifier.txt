Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently evaluate each for **full reproducibility**:  
**Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode is fully explicit, unambiguous, self-contained, and complete so that a direct, line-by-line implementation will unquestionably pass all valid unit tests in every normal, edge, boundary, and error scenario without any guesswork or assumptions. Otherwise, output `0`.**

### Definitions of Full Reproducibility (all below must be strictly true):

1. **Explicit Inputs, Outputs, and Types**  
   - All inputs and outputs are clearly defined, including their data types, structures, valid value ranges, and constraints.  
   - All variables, constants, functions, and data structures used are either explicitly declared or inferrable without external assumptions.  
   - No calls or references to any undefined or external functions, libraries, global variables, or environment-specific constructs.

2. **Comprehensive and Precise Logic Specification**  
   - Every control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion) has clearly stated loop bounds, conditions, and termination guarantees to avoid infinite or undefined behavior.  
   - All branches and cases fully cover the input domain with no implicit “catch-all” or underspecified conditions.  
   - Algorithmic steps and operations are described concretely without placeholders like “handle accordingly,” “process error,” or vague directives requiring external interpretation.

3. **Deterministic and Consistent Execution Semantics**  
   - Evaluation order, side effects, data mutations, and indexing conventions (0-based or 1-based) are either explicitly specified or consistently applied and unambiguous.  
   - No ambiguities in arithmetic, data access, or state updates; each operation’s effect is clearly and uniquely defined.

4. **Self-Containment Without External or Hidden Context**  
   - The pseudocode stands alone: it requires no supplemental domain knowledge, platform-dependent behavior, or assumptions not contained within the pseudocode or explicitly stated problem scope.  
   - All dependencies are fully declared or derivable from the provided text.

5. **Complete Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Handling**  
   - All edge cases—including minimal input sizes, empty or null inputs, maximal values, and invalid inputs where applicable—are expressly handled or demonstrated to be logically impossible.  
   - No input within the defined domain can cause undefined, unexpected, or erroneous behavior.

6. **Logical Soundness and Internal Consistency**  
   - The pseudocode contains no contradictions, conflicting variable states, or steps that are impossible or ambiguous to implement.  
   - Data transformations maintain consistent data states and invariants throughout execution.

7. **Direct Implementation Ready Without Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode fully specifies all initializations, iterative steps, variable updates, and return statement details needed to produce correct output strictly according to the stated problem.  
   - No external inference, guessing, or supplemental explanation is needed to translate pseudocode into standard programming languages faithfully.

---

### Output Format:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, produce a single continuous string of digits (`1` or `0`) with no spaces, line breaks, or any additional characters.  
- The nth output digit corresponds exactly to the nth input pseudocode’s reproducibility judgment.  
- Output only the concatenated reproducibility digits; do not include explanations, probabilities, partial scores, comments, or metadata.

---

### Important Clarifications for Judgement (do not output):

- Any necessity to assume or fill in missing details results in output `0`.  
- Any vagueness, implicit conditions, or references to external knowledge result in `0`.  
- Ambiguous or unspecified control flows or data handling result in `0`.  
- Explicit, exhaustive, consistent, logically coherent pseudocode that is clearly ready for direct implementation without ambiguity results in `1`.

---

### Summary:

**Judge each pseudocode independently and output `1` only if it is fully explicit, unambiguous, complete, and self-contained so that its direct implementation will deterministically pass every valid unit test (normal, edge, boundary, error) without any supplemental assumptions or interpretation. Otherwise, output `0`.**

**Strictly output only the reproducibility digit string.**  
No other text, formatting, or symbols.
