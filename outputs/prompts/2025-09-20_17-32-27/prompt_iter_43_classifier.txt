Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently evaluate each for **full, strict reproducibility**: each must be implementable literally and directly—as stated, without any implicit assumptions, missing details, or ambiguities—and guaranteed to pass **all valid unit tests** (normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) without fail.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit, concatenated in input order, with no spaces, line breaks, or explanations:  
- Output **1** only if the pseudocode is fully explicit, unambiguous, self-contained, and complete—implementable line-by-line exactly as given—and will certainly pass all tests.  
- Output **0** otherwise (if any ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumption, missing input/output specification, unclear control flow, undefined behavior, or contextual dependency exists).

### Comprehensive Criteria for Determining Full Reproducibility (ALL must hold):

1. **Explicit and Complete Definitions**  
   - Every variable, function, parameter, data structure, constant, and return type is defined unambiguously or clearly inferable without assumptions.  
   - Input and output formats, types, valid domains, and structures are fully described or precisely derivable from the pseudocode alone.  
   - No references to unspecified external functions, libraries, global states, or hidden context.

2. **Unambiguous, Fully Specified Control and Logic**  
   - All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) include exact bounds, termination conditions, and clearly defined state changes.  
   - Every conditional branch exhaustively covers all cases relevant to the declared input domain—no implicit “else” behavior left undefined.  
   - No vague instructions (e.g., “handle errors”, “process appropriately”) without explicit, algorithmic detail.

3. **Deterministic and Precise Semantics**  
   - All operations (indexing, assignments, calculations, mutations) have clear, consistent, well-defined semantics, including indexing bases (zero or one) stated or made unmistakably consistent.  
   - No underspecified evaluation order or ambiguous side effects.

4. **Self-Containment and Context Independence**  
   - The pseudocode stands fully independently: no platform-, language-, or environment-specific assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated or clearly derivable.  
   - No reliance on external or hidden domain knowledge; all dependencies and assumptions are declared or clearly inferable inside the pseudocode.

5. **Exhaustive Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - All possible inputs (including empty, minimal, maximal, malformed if applicable) within the declared input space are handled explicitly or logically impossible.  
   - No valid input leads to undefined, silent failure, infinite loops, crashes, or ambiguous behavior.

6. **Logical Consistency and Soundness**  
   - No contradictions or inconsistencies (e.g., use-before-assignment, mutually exclusive conditions marked true simultaneously, data corruption).  
   - The pseudocode’s algorithmic steps logically progress toward the stated goal, maintaining internal data structure integrity and state coherence at every step.

7. **Direct, Literal Implementability Without Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode provides all details required to immediately and linearly translate it into executable code (including index ranges, initializations, data updates, and result extraction).  
   - No need for guessing, inferring unstated steps, or adding external knowledge.

---

### Output Instructions:

- When multiple pseudocodes are given, output a single continuous string of digits (`1` or `0`), corresponding in order to each input pseudocode’s reproducibility.  
- Output strictly only that digit string—no spaces, newlines, punctuation, explanations, or extra characters.

---

### Judgment Notes (for internal use only, do not output):

- Any test requiring assumptions, inference, or supplementation → `0`  
- Ambiguity, unspecified data, or incomplete edge case coverage → `0`  
- Reliance on implicit language/runtime/platform/domain details → `0`  
- Infinite or undefined loops, incomplete or ambiguous branching → `0`  
- Each input pseudocode judged fully independently against these criteria.

---

### Summary:

Return `1` if and only if the pseudocode is entirely explicit, unambiguous, self-contained, and fully detailed to directly pass all unit tests as is. Otherwise, return `0`.  
Result is a strict binary string indicating reproducibility of each input pseudocode in order.

---

**Example outputs**:  
- One fully reproducible pseudocode → `1`  
- One incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where the first and third are reproducible, the second is not → `101`

**Strictly no output or content beyond the concatenated reproducibility digits.**
