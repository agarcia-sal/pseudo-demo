Given one or more pseudocode inputs, evaluate each independently to determine whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning that it can be directly and unambiguously implemented exactly as given, without any assumptions, implicit details, or missing information, so that the resulting implementation would pass **all valid unit tests**, including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases without fail.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit (concatenate digits with no spaces, newlines, or extra characters):  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** of the following strict criteria for full reproducibility;  
- Otherwise output **0**.

### Definitive Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be strictly satisfied):

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, parameters, data structures, functions, constants, and return types are clearly defined or logically and unambiguously inferable solely from the pseudocode itself.  
   - Input domains, data types, formats, value ranges, and data structures are explicitly stated or deterministically derivable.  
   - No reference to any undefined or external function, API, environment, state, or library unless explicitly described within the pseudocode.

2. **Unambiguous, Fully Detailed Algorithmic Logic**  
   - Every control flow construct (loops, recursion, conditionals) explicitly defines all iteration ranges, indices, boundary conditions, and termination criteria, ensuring no infinite loops or undefined halts.  
   - Branching logic exhaustively covers all possible input cases with no missing or implicit cases.  
   - All operations, including data manipulations, condition checks, updates, and error handling, are described in sufficient stepwise detail—no vague expressions like “handle accordingly” or “process errors” without exact procedural instructions.

3. **Deterministic and Precise Operational Semantics**  
   - Indexing schemes (zero-based or one-based) are consistently applied and clearly stated or unambiguously inferable.  
   - Evaluation order of expressions, side effects, state mutations, and updates is fully defined or standard by convention without ambiguity.  
   - All data transformations and side effects are explicitly delineated so implementations require no guesswork.

4. **Self-Containment and Context-Independence**  
   - The pseudocode must be fully self-sufficient without relying on hidden context, platform-specific features, or external knowledge beyond what is included in the pseudocode itself.  
   - Any assumptions, environmental conditions, or dependencies must be explicitly declared or explicitly derivable.

5. **Robust Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Conditions**  
   - All relevant special cases—including empty inputs, smallest/largest values, malformed or invalid inputs where applicable—are systematically handled, or logically impossible within specified input domain.  
   - No scenario can cause undefined, erroneous, silent failures, or incomplete handling.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Coherence**  
   - The pseudocode must not contain contradictory instructions (e.g., use before assignment, conflicting conditions both expected true simultaneously, inconsistent state updates).  
   - The flow of logic must consistently progress to fulfill the stated objective, preserving invariant properties of data and state.

7. **Direct and Complete Implementability Without Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode is fully "ready to implement"—every index, variable initialization, iteration, and state update is specified explicitly so the pseudocode can be mapped to executable code line-by-line without any additional interpretation or assumptions.  
   - No missing details or implicit requirements exist that would force the implementer to guess or supply unstated information.

### Output Instructions:

- When multiple pseudocode inputs are given, output a continuous string of digits, each corresponding to the reproducibility label of the respective pseudocode in input order.  
- Output **only** this digit string — no spaces, newlines, punctuation, explanations, comments, or partial scores.

---

### Important Internal Judgement Rules (do not output, use only for your assessment):

- Any missing explicit definitions, implicit assumptions, underspecified operations, or undefined input/output formats → output `0`.  
- Ambiguity in indexing, control flow, or data updates → `0`.  
- Reliance on external, hidden platform, library, or environmental behavior → `0`.  
- Infinite loops, nontermination potential, or incomplete branch coverage → `0`.  
- Contradictions or logical inconsistency in variable usage or control flow → `0`.  
- Perfectly clear, detailed, logically coherent, fully self-contained pseudocode with exhaustive edge and error case coverage → `1`.

---

### Summary:

Output **1** only if the pseudocode can be implemented exactly as given and guaranteed to pass **all** valid unit tests without any need for guesswork, domain-specific knowledge, or unstated assumptions. Otherwise output **0**. The final output is a strict binary vector representing reproducibility of the input pseudocode list in order.

---

**Examples:**  
- One fully reproducible pseudocode → output: `1`  
- One incomplete / ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes with first and third reproducible, second not → output: `101`

**Strictly output only the concatenated sequence of `0` and `1` digits — nothing else.**
