Evaluate each given pseudocode independently to determine **strict binary reproducibility** as follows:

Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** these stringent criteria ensuring a direct, unambiguous, complete, and context-independent implementation that will pass every valid unit test (including normal, boundary, edge, and error cases) without any assumptions or reinterpretations. Otherwise, output **0**.

### Reproducibility Criteria (ALL must be met):

**1. Explicitness and Completeness:**  
- All variables, parameters, data structures, functions, constants, and return values are completely and clearly defined or fully inferable strictly from the pseudocode alone, with no missing declarations or implicit elements.  
- Input and output specifications (types, formats, value domains, data structures) are precise and unambiguous.  
- No references to external libraries, global state, environment variables, or hidden context not included in the pseudocode.  

**2. Fully Determined and Exhaustive Control Flow:**  
- All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) specify exact loop ranges, boundaries, and termination conditions preventing infinite loops or nondeterministic halts.  
- All possible branches handle every valid input scenario explicitly; no implicit default or unhandled cases exist.  
- Every step and operation is fully described with exact logic; no vague or placeholder instructions remain (e.g., "handle error", "process accordingly").  

**3. Precise, Consistent Operational Semantics:**  
- Data manipulations, indexing, arithmetic, assignments, and side effects are explicitly detailed with consistent conventions (e.g., indexing starting point stated or obviously uniform and consistent).  
- Evaluation order and state updates are non-ambiguous and deterministic.  
- No underspecified or conflicting operations or side effects.  

**4. Self-Containment and Platform Independence:**  
- The solution is completely self-sufficient; it does not rely on any domain knowledge, environmental assumptions, or platform-specific characteristics beyond what is written.  
- All dependencies or required knowledge are either explicitly stated or fully derivable from the pseudocode itself.  

**5. Complete Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases:**  
- Edge cases such as empty inputs, minimum and maximum values, and invalid or malformed inputs (if within the declared domain) are explicitly handled or logically impossible due to input constraints.  
- No undefined, erroneous, or silent failure scenarios exist for any valid input.  

**6. Logical Coherence and Internal Consistency:**  
- No contradictions or logical conflicts (e.g., variables used before assignment, overlapping contradictory conditions, inconsistent state).  
- Data and state changes maintain internal consistency throughout all steps and control flows.  
- Steps consistently and clearly progress towards the stated goal without gaps or ambiguous intermediate states.  

**7. Direct and Complete Implementability:**  
- The pseudocode can be translated to actual executable code **line-by-line without any supplement, guesswork, or external inference**.  
- All indices, initializations, iterations, and output constructions are fully specified.  

---

### Output format:

- For **each pseudocode input**, output exactly one digit:  
  - `1` if it satisfies **all** above criteria (fully reproducible).  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- For multiple inputs, concatenate digits in the original order without spaces, line breaks, or any extra characters.  
- Output nothing else — no explanations, no comments, no partial scores.

---

### Additional guidance (for evaluation only; do not output):  
- Any assumption, external knowledge, incomplete detail, or ambiguity → output `0`  
- Any missing or incomplete handling of edge/error cases → output `0`  
- Implicit, vague controls, or incomplete branch coverage → output `0`  
- Logical contradictions or inconsistent state management → output `0`  
- Unstated platform or environment dependencies → output `0`  

---

**In summary:** Output `1` only when the pseudocode is perfectly explicit, self-contained, unambiguous, deterministic, logically coherent, and complete so it can pass **all** valid unit tests with no additional interpretation; else, output `0`.

---

**Examples:**  
- One fully reproducible pseudocode → output: `1`  
- One ambiguous or incomplete pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where only first and last are reproducible → output: `101`

**Strictly output only the concatenated reproducibility digit string.**
