Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to independently assess each against the **strict, formal criterion of full reproducibility**: that is, whether each pseudocode can be implemented exactly as written, with zero ambiguity, incompleteness, or hidden assumptions, such that the resulting implementation is guaranteed to pass **all valid unit tests** of the problem. These include normal, edge, boundary, and error cases, with no exceptions or undefined behavior.

---

### For each pseudocode input, output a single digit only:

- **Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode is fully reproducible per the following rigorous checklist;**  
- **Output `0` if it violates any condition below.**

Concatenate all digits for multiple inputs in input order, without spaces, newlines, or extra characters.

**No other output—no explanations, comments, uncertainty, or partial scores.**

### Definitive Requirements for Reproducibility

Your judgment must confirm all the following are strictly fulfilled:

1. **Complete, Explicit, and Self-Describing Interface and Data Declarations:**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, functions, parameters, constants, and data structures are explicitly declared or precisely inferable from the pseudocode alone, with no guesswork.  
   - Their types, formats, value ranges, and data structures (e.g., arrays, lists, tuples) are clearly specified or unambiguously derivable.  
   - No reference to any undeclared or external functions, libraries, variables, or environment assumptions.

2. **Exhaustive, Unambiguous, and Well-Defined Control Flow and Logic:**  
   - All loops, conditionals, and recursion are explicitly bounded and terminate properly for all inputs.  
   - Every branch condition accounts comprehensively for all input cases, with no gaps, conflicts, or undefined branches.  
   - No vague instructions or placeholders — all operations and error handling behaviors are concretely described at algorithmic detail.

3. **Precise and Deterministic Semantics of Operations:**  
   - All data manipulation, arithmetic, indexing, and state mutations are defined exactly, with no ambiguous order of evaluation or side effects.  
   - Indexing conventions (zero-based or one-based) are stated or consistently applied without contradictions anywhere.  
   - No underspecified or implicit side effects or order dependencies.

4. **Full Context-Independence and Self-Containment:**  
   - The pseudocode must be executable and interpretable without any external contextual knowledge, domain-specific assumptions, or platform-specific behavior.  
   - All dependencies and environmental assumptions must be explicitly declared or logically deducible within the pseudocode.

5. **Complete and Explicit Handling of All Valid Inputs, Including Edge and Error Cases:**  
   - Every edge case (empty inputs, minimal/maximal values, invalid or malformed inputs where applicable) is explicitly handled or proven impossible.  
   - No input within the specified domain can cause undefined states, runtime errors, infinite loops, or silent failures.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Coherence:**  
   - No contradictions, conflicting assumptions, or impossible-to-satisfy conditions occur.  
   - Variables are never used before assignment; data states remain consistent; and every step logically progresses towards the specified output.

7. **Direct Implementability with Zero Interpretation or Supplementation:**  
   - The pseudocode can be translated line-for-line into a conventional programming language without requiring any assumptions, clarifications, or additional information beyond what is strictly written.  
   - All initializations, index ranges, increments/decrements, data constructions, and return values are fully specified.

### Important Implementation Notes (for internal use, do NOT output):

- If any assumption or inference beyond the explicit pseudocode is necessary → output `0`.  
- Any ambiguity, incompleteness, or missing detail → output `0`.  
- Reliance on implicit platform, language semantics, or external knowledge → output `0`.  
- Undefined termination, infinite loops, or incomplete branches → output `0`.  
- Judge each pseudocode independently and strictly as a binary classification.

### Summary

**Output a binary reproducibility code string: '1' for fully reproducible pseudocode inputs, '0' otherwise**, strictly in input order, no separators or extraneous characters.

---

**Example:**  
- Input: three pseudocode snippets where only the second is fully reproducible  
- Output: `010`

---

**Strictly output nothing else beyond the exact concatenated string of digits.**
