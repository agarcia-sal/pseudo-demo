Evaluate each given pseudocode snippet independently to determine whether it is **unconditionally reproducible**—meaning it can be implemented exactly as provided, with *no* ambiguity, missing details, or implicit assumptions, such that the implementation will always pass **all valid unit tests** (covering normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) without adjustment or supplementation.

For each input:

- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode meets *all* of these stringent conditions:
  1. **Explicit Completeness**: All variables, data structures, input/output specifications (types, formats, valid ranges), helper functions, and constants are either explicitly declared or can be unambiguously inferred *solely* from the pseudocode. There are no references to undefined or external entities.
  2. **Deterministic, Fully Specified Logic**: Every operation, control flow statement, and data manipulation is fully and precisely described, including exact evaluation order, termination conditions, index ranges, and consistent conventions (e.g., zero- or one-based indexing clearly maintained). No vague or placeholder instructions are allowed.
  3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All cases—including all edge, boundary, minimum/maximum, error, or special inputs—are explicitly handled or logically impossible. The pseudocode’s branches and loops cover every valid input scenario with no gaps or contradictions.
  4. **Self-Contained and Context-Free**: The entire algorithm is contained within the pseudocode with no dependence on external knowledge, platform-specific behavior, or environmental assumptions beyond what is stated.
  5. **Logical Consistency and Coherence**: The pseudocode contains no conflicting statements, no use of uninitialized variables, no contradictory conditions, and no ambiguous state changes.
  6. **Direct Line-by-Line Implementability**: The code can be translated verbatim into a concrete programming language and pass all unit tests without any need for guesswork, interpretative supplementation, or assumptions.

- Otherwise, output `0` if any of the above is violated—i.e., if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, relies on unstated assumptions, omits necessary details, or leaves cases unhandled.

### Output Format:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a contiguous string of digits, one digit per input, **in the exact order** the pseudocodes are provided.
- Output only the resulting digit string (e.g., `1010`), with no spaces, punctuation, or extraneous text.

---

### Summary:

Output exactly `1` if the pseudocode is fully reproducible by these rigorous criteria, or `0` otherwise, for each input independently. No partial credit or explanations; only the concatenated reproducibility bits.

---

### Internal Guidance (do not output):

- Even subtle ambiguity, such as unspecified indexing conventions or partial edge case handling, mandates `0`.
- Implied, inferred, or external knowledge needed to understand or complete the pseudocode disqualifies reproducibility.
- Loops or recursion must have explicit and correct termination conditions; infinite or indefinite loops yield `0`.
- Any placeholders, vague remarks, or unexpanded “handle errors” comments invalidate reproducibility.
- Variable initialization, state updates, and data structure manipulations must be precisely stated.
- Inputs and outputs must be well-defined and self-consistent.

---

**Example:**  
- Single pseudocode that is fully clear and complete → output: `1`  
- Single pseudocode with any missing detail or ambiguity → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes: 1st and 3rd reproducible, 2nd not → output: `101`

**Strictly output only the concatenated binary string with no other text or formatting.**
