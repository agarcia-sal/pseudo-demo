Given one or more independent pseudocode inputs, your task is to evaluate each pseudocode snippet **individually** and determine if it is **fully reproducible** with absolute certainty—that is, it can be directly implemented without any ambiguity, missing information, or unstated assumptions, and will pass **every valid unit test**, including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases, flawlessly and without exception.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit, concatenated in the order the pseudocodes are given, with **no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or explanations**:

- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode fully satisfies every reproducibility criterion listed below, enabling a line-by-line implementation that guarantees passing all valid tests.
- Output **0** if any ambiguity, incompleteness, unstated assumptions, inconsistency, missing edge case coverage, vague operations, or dependency on external context exists.

### Comprehensive Criteria for Full Reproducibility (All must be strictly satisfied):

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification**  
   - Every input, output, variable, parameter, data structure, constant, function, and return type is clearly named and either explicitly defined in the pseudocode or unambiguously inferable without external assumptions.  
   - Data types, valid value ranges, and input/output formats must be detailed or clearly derivable solely from the pseudocode.  
   - No references to any undeclared external modules, global states, libraries, or platform-specific features.

2. **Precise, Deterministic Logic and Control Flow**  
   - All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) define explicit iteration ranges, boundary conditions, and terminations that prevent infinite loops or undefined halts.  
   - Branches comprehensively handle every possible input or state, with no implicit or omitted cases.  
   - Every step, operation, and condition is specific and detailed; no use of vague or placeholder wording such as “process accordingly,” “handle errors,” or “etc.” without complete procedural elaboration.

3. **Clear and Consistent Operation Semantics**  
   - All data manipulations and computations specify exact evaluation order, indexing conventions (zero-based or one-based), mutation semantics, and side effects.  
   - No ambiguous indexing or partially specified data updates; index bounds and updates must be clear and internally consistent across the pseudocode.  
   - Arithmetic, comparisons, and assignments follow standard, widely understood semantics as used in common programming languages.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Independent**  
   - The pseudocode functions as a standalone solution: it requires no external knowledge or environmental assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated.  
   - Any assumptions or dependencies must be fully declared and shown to be derivable only from the pseudocode text and its inputs/outputs.

5. **Exhaustive and Explicit Edge, Boundary, and Error Handling**  
   - The pseudocode must explicitly or logically handle all potential edge cases including empty inputs, minimal/maximal values, invalid or malformed data where relevant (or demonstrate these cases are impossible/irrelevant).  
   - No input or scenario within the stated domain can cause undefined, silent failures, or runtime errors.

6. **Logical Coherence and Internal Consistency**  
   - The pseudocode contains no internal contradictions such as conflicting conditions, use-before-initialization, or inconsistent state updates.  
   - All variable assignments and state transitions logically advance toward the intended goal without ambiguity or semantic gaps.

7. **Direct, Implementation-Ready Clarity**  
   - The pseudocode can be implemented literally, line-by-line, in any conventional programming language without requiring additional interpretation, assumption, or supplementation.  
   - All necessary initializations, iterations, data constructions, and return paths are fully and explicitly described.

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single continuous string of digits without any separators, newlines, or comments.  
- The Nth digit corresponds to the reproducibility of the Nth pseudocode input.  
- Output only the reproducibility digits (`1` or `0`), with no additional text.

---

### Important Judgement Notes (Do not output):

- Inferences, guesses, or supplementation from outside the pseudocode cause a `0`.  
- Any ambiguity, partial details, or missing coverage causes a `0`.  
- Reliance on external or platform/environment-specific behavior causes a `0`.  
- Absence or ambiguity in termination conditions or exhaustive case handling causes a `0`.  
- Contradictory or inconsistent logic causes a `0`.

---

### Summary:

Only output `1` for pseudocode that is fully deterministic, explicit, and complete, enabling a **guaranteed, direct implementation that passes all valid unit tests with no supplementation or interpretation**. Otherwise, output `0`. The output is a strict binary vector representing reproducibility for each input pseudocode, in order.

---

**Example outputs:**  
- Single reproducible pseudocode only → output: `1`  
- Single incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode only → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes with first and last reproducible, second not → output: `101`

**Strictly output only the concatenated reproducibility digits. Nothing else.**
