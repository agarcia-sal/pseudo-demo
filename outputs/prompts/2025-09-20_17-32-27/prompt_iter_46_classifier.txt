Evaluate each provided pseudocode snippet independently and determine if it is fully **reproducible.** A pseudocode is considered **fully reproducible** if and only if it meets all the following rigorous conditions so that a direct, literal implementation from the pseudocode (without any external assumptions, additions, or clarifications) will **always** pass **all** valid unit tests, including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit `1` if it is fully reproducible, otherwise output `0` if it fails any part of the criteria. For multiple inputs, output a string concatenating these digits in the exact input order, with no spaces, newlines, or extra characters.

### Definitive Criteria for Full Reproducibility:

1. **Explicit Declaration and Definition of All Elements**  
   - Every variable, parameter, constant, function, data structure, and return value is explicitly declared or entirely and unambiguously derivable from within the pseudocode alone.  
   - Input/output types, formats, valid value ranges, and structures are precisely stated or clearly and logically inferable without guesswork.  
   - There are no references to undeclared external libraries, functions, variables, or states beyond what’s presented.

2. **Complete Control Flow and Logic Coverage**  
   - All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) have precisely defined indices, ranges, bounds, and termination conditions, leaving no ambiguity about when and how they run or finish.  
   - Every conditional and branch exhaustively covers all possible input cases with explicit logic; no implicit fall-through or unspecified handling.  
   - No vague instructions or placeholders such as “handle accordingly,” “process errors,” or “apply logic here” without explicit, step-by-step algorithmic details.

3. **Unambiguous, Deterministic Operations and Conventions**  
   - All operations (arithmetic, indexing, data updates, side effects) are defined with clear, consistent semantics and data conventions (e.g., zero-based vs. one-based indexing explicitly given or consistently implied).  
   - The evaluation order within expressions and sequences of statements is clear and free from ambiguity or reliance on platform-specific behaviors.  
   - Mutations of state or variables are fully described so the exact effect and final state is deterministic.

4. **Self-Contained Scope Without External Knowledge or Context**  
   - The solution is fully self-sufficient: no hidden assumptions about environment, external system behavior, runtime platform, or domain knowledge beyond what the pseudocode explicitly provides.  
   - All dependencies and assumptions are explicitly declared or can be logically derived solely from the pseudocode textual content.

5. **Exhaustive and Robust Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Handling**  
   - Edge cases, including empty inputs, minimal/maximal values, and invalid or malformed inputs (where relevant and applicable), are explicitly handled or logically impossible given the problem constraints.  
   - The pseudocode guarantees no undefined, silent failures, infinite loops, or crashes for any valid input within the declared domain.

6. **Internal Logical Consistency and Semantic Soundness**  
   - No contradictions exist such as conflicting variable uses (e.g., use before assignment), mutually exclusive conditions assumed simultaneously, or inconsistent data states through the logic.  
   - Data structures and states remain coherent and logically consistent at every step relevant to fulfilling the stated algorithmic goal.

7. **Direct, One-to-One Implementability Without Interpretation or Augmentation**  
   - It is possible to translate the pseudocode line-by-line into executable code in a standard programming language exactly as given.  
   - No part of the pseudocode requires guessing, implicit knowledge, contextual supplementation, or creative interpretation to implement correctly.

### Output Format:

- For each pseudocode snippet, **output only a single digit**:  
  - `1` if it strictly meets **all** the above criteria;  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- For multiple snippets, output digits concatenated in order of input, with no spaces, newlines, or any additional characters.  
- **No explanations, comments, or partial scores should be output.**

---

### Important Internal Judgment Rules (do not output):

- Any ambiguity, unspecified behavior, or implicit assumption disqualifies reproducibility and results in `0`.  
- Missing edge case coverage or partial logic invalidates reproducibility → `0`.  
- References to external or hidden context or libraries → `0`.  
- Potential for infinite loops or ambiguous termination → `0`.  
- Contradictory or inconsistent logic → `0`.  
- If direct, literal, line-by-line implementation (without adding or assuming anything) must fail some test case → `0`.  
- Only perfectly explicit, exhaustive, and unambiguous pseudocode should receive `1`.

---

### Summary:

Your goal is to judge with **absolute precision and strictness** whether each pseudocode is fully reproducible as defined, outputting a **binary digit string** reflecting reproducibility of every input snippet. A `1` means the pseudocode is fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all tests when implemented verbatim, a `0` means it is not. The output must contain only these digits, nothing else.

---

**Example:**  
- Single fully reproducible pseudocode → output: `1`  
- Single incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes, first and third reproducible, second not → output: `101`

**Strictly output only the concatenated string of digits corresponding to each pseudocode input, with no formatting or commentary.**
