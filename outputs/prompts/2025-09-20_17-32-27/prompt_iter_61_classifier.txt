Given one or more pseudocode inputs, evaluate each pseudocode independently to determine if it is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be straightforwardly and precisely implemented exactly as given, without any need for assumptions, clarifications, external knowledge, or supplementation, and will pass **all** valid unit tests (including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) without fail.

For each input pseudocode, output a single digit in exact input order, concatenated without spaces, line breaks, or any other characters:

- Output **1** if the pseudocode is rigorously complete, explicit, and unambiguous across all relevant dimensions such that a direct code translation is guaranteed to pass all unit tests.
- Output **0** otherwise (if there is any ambiguity, incompleteness, missing detail, implicit assumption, undefined behavior, or logical incoherence).

---

### Definitive Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be strictly satisfied):

1. **Explicit and Complete Specification of Interface and Elements**  
  - All variables, parameters, constants, data structures, functions, and return types must be explicitly defined or logically and uniquely inferable from the pseudocode itself without guessing.  
  - Input and output formats, data types, valid value ranges, and structures must be fully described or deterministically derivable from the pseudocode.  
  - There are no references to external libraries, undefined functions, global states, or platform/environment-dependent features unless explicitly detailed in the pseudocode.

2. **Unambiguous and Exhaustive Logical Flow**  
  - Every control flow construct (loops, conditionals, recursion) includes precise indexing, boundary conditions, loop invariants, and clear termination criteria that prohibit infinite loops or undefined halts.  
  - All branches and cases exhaustively cover the entire input domain without hidden or implicit assumptions.  
  - Each operation or instruction is concretely defined with no vague or placeholder phrases (e.g., “handle errors accordingly” without precise steps is unacceptable).

3. **Fully Deterministic and Precisely Defined Operations**  
  - All indexing, iteration, data mutations, arithmetic operations, and side effects must be explicitly stated, with consistent and clear conventions that leave no ambiguity (e.g., indexing base, order of evaluation).  
  - There must be no underspecified behavior related to operand evaluation order, concurrency, or state changes.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Independent**  
  - The pseudocode solution must stand alone, requiring no external context, domain knowledge, environment assumptions, or implicit platform conventions beyond exactly what’s provided.  
  - Any dependencies or assumptions must be clearly declared within the pseudocode.

5. **Comprehensive Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Handling**  
  - All conceivable edge cases, boundary conditions, invalid or malformed inputs within the declared domain are either explicitly handled or logically impossible given the specification.  
  - No input in the declared domain should cause undefined, silent, or erroneous behavior.

6. **Logical Soundness and Internal Consistency**  
  - The pseudocode contains no logical contradictions, such as using variables before assignment, mutually exclusive conditions both assumed true, or inconsistent data state transitions.  
  - The sequence of steps logically progresses toward the stated goal without ambiguity or incoherence.

7. **Ready for Direct Implementation Without Interpretation**  
  - The pseudocode is complete line-by-line, fully specifying initialization, processing, iteration, and output construction such that it can be implemented verbatim into a programming language without any supplementary assumptions, guesswork, or additions.

### Output Format:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single contiguous string of digits (`1` or `0`) in the exact sequence the pseudocodes are presented, with absolutely no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or extra text.  
- Each digit corresponds uniquely to the reproducibility of one pseudocode input.

---

### Important Constraints (for internal judgment only, **do not output**):

- Any need to infer unstated details, guess missing information, or interpret vague instructions must result in `0`.  
- Any ambiguity, incompleteness, missing error handling, or insufficient edge case coverage requires output `0`.  
- Implicit reliance on non-stated environment, platform, or external behavior leads to `0`.  
- Logical gaps, infinite/undefined loops, or partial case coverage leads to `0`.  
- Each pseudocode is judged independently under these strict binary rules.

---

### Summary:

Only output `1` if the pseudocode is a fully self-contained, unambiguous, exhaustive, and logically sound algorithmic description that can be directly and deterministically implemented to pass all valid unit tests without any external supplementation or interpretation. Otherwise, output `0`.  
The output is a strict binary vector representing reproducibility in the input order.

---

**Example outputs:**  
- Single reproducible pseudocode → `1`  
- Single incomplete/ambiguous pseudocode → `0`  
- Three inputs with first and third reproducible, second not → `101`

**Strictly no additional output or formatting beyond the concatenated digit string.**
