Evaluate each provided pseudocode input independently for strict, unconditional reproducibility: that is, the ability to be implemented exactly as given, requiring no assumptions, guesses, or external information, and guaranteed to pass every possible valid unit test—including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases—without exception or failure.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit (concatenated with others in input order, no spaces or extra characters):  
- Output **1** if the pseudocode meets **all** of the below rigorous criteria, enabling direct, unambiguous implementation guaranteed to pass all tests.  
- Output **0** if it fails **any** criterion—due to ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumptions, unspecified input or output formats, missing edge case handling, undefined behavior, infinite or unclear termination, contradictory logic, external dependencies, or need for interpretation beyond what is explicitly stated.

### Rigorous Criteria for Determining Full Reproducibility (all must hold):

1. **Complete and Explicit Declarations**  
   - All variables, parameters, return values, data structures, and constants are explicitly defined or directly and unambiguously inferred from the pseudocode as stated.  
   - Input and output formats, types, valid value ranges, and data structures must be fully specified or perfectly derivable without guesswork or external knowledge.  
   - No references to undeclared functions, libraries, global state, or external context.

2. **Fully Specified and Deterministic Control Flow**  
   - All loops and recursion have explicitly stated bounds and well-defined termination conditions proven to always halt.  
   - Conditionals cover all logically possible cases without leaving gaps or requiring implicit interpretation.  
   - Logic steps use precise operations without vague instructions or placeholders (e.g., no “handle accordingly” or “process errors” without definitive detail).

3. **Exact and Consistent Semantics for Operations**  
   - All arithmetic, indexing, data access, mutation, and side effects are fully specified with unambiguous, consistent conventions (e.g., indexing base clearly defined and uniformly used).  
   - Evaluation order and side effect sequences are explicit or obviously consistent, eliminating nondeterminism or ambiguity.

4. **Self-Contained, Context-Free Specification**  
   - The pseudocode is entirely self-sufficient: it requires no environment-specific behaviors, no implicit or domain-specific knowledge beyond what is explicitly stated.  
   - All dependencies, assumptions, and conventions must be explicitly declared or clearly inferable solely from the pseudocode text.

5. **Complete Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Coverage**  
   - Explicit or logically guaranteed handling of all edge and boundary cases (empty inputs, minimal/maximal values, error inputs where applicable).  
   - No path through the logic leads to undefined, erroneous, or silent failures for any inputs within specified domains.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Soundness**  
   - No use-before-assignment, no contradictory or mutually exclusive assumptions accepted simultaneously.  
   - Data states and flow are coherent, and all updates and results align logically towards the declared objective.

7. **Direct Translability and Implementation-Readiness**  
   - The pseudocode can be translated line-for-line into a concrete programming language without requiring extrapolation, supplemental assumptions, or guesswork.  
   - All index ranges, initializations, iterations, result constructions, and data handling steps are exhaustively and explicitly described.

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single uninterrupted string of digits (no spaces, newlines, comments, or other characters).  
- Each digit corresponds exactly, in order, to the reproducibility verdict of its input.  
- Output only the digit string—nothing else.

---

### Important Internal Notes (do not output):  
- Any implicit assumptions, missing details, or ambiguity → output `0`.  
- Any undefined or nonterminating control flow → output `0`.  
- Any external dependency or hidden context → output `0`.  
- Perfect, explicit, and unambiguous provision of all details → output `1`.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` only for pseudocode that is entirely self-contained, unambiguous, exhaustive, and implementation-ready—guaranteeing passing all valid tests with no interpretation needed. Otherwise, output `0`.  
Provide the strict binary vector reflecting reproducibility in input sequence order, with no extras.

---

**Example:**  
- Single fully reproducible input → output: `1`  
- Single ambiguous or incomplete input → output: `0`  
- Three inputs, with reproducible, non-reproducible, reproducible → output: `101`

**Strictly produce only the concatenated digits, nothing else.**
