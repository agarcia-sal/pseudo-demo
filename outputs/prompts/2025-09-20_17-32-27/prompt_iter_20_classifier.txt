Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to evaluate each independently and determine if it is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be implemented precisely as given, without any ambiguity, missing detail, or external assumptions, and will pass **all valid unit tests**, including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases, without exception.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit, concatenated in input order and with no spaces, breaks, or extra characters:  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is complete, explicit, and unambiguous so that a direct implementation will certainly pass all tests,  
- Output **0** otherwise (if any incompleteness, ambiguity, omission, assumption, or unspecified behavior exists).

### Core Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all below must be strictly satisfied):

1. **Complete and Explicit Definitions**  
   - All variables, parameters, data structures, functions, constants, and return types are clearly introduced or explicitly inferable without assumption.  
   - Inputs and outputs (their types, formats, valid ranges, and structures) are unambiguously specified or derivable solely from the pseudocode.  
   - No references to undeclared or undocumented external libraries, functions, states, or global variables.

2. **Unambiguous, Exhaustive Logic and Control Flow**  
   - Every control flow element (loops, conditionals, recursion) has clearly defined indexing, boundaries, loop invariants, and termination conditions that prevent infinite loops or undefined halts.  
   - Branch cases comprehensively cover all possible inputs with no logical gaps or implicit handling.  
   - All operations and steps are precisely described—no vague directives or placeholders such as “process accordingly” or “handle errors” without exact algorithmic detail.

3. **Deterministic and Precise Operations**  
   - All data manipulations, indexing, state updates, arithmetic operations, and side effects are specified exactly with clear semantics.  
   - The pseudocode strictly follows conventional and consistent indexing and operation conventions (e.g., zero- or one-based indexing stated or implicitly clear and maintained consistently).  
   - No underspecified or ambiguous evaluation order, data mutations, or side effects.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Independent**  
   - The entire solution stands alone without requiring platform-specific behavior, hidden domain knowledge, environmental assumptions, or external context beyond the pseudocode and stated inputs/outputs.  
   - All dependencies and assumptions must be explicitly declared or clearly derivable within the pseudocode text.

5. **Exhaustive Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - All edge cases (empty inputs, minimal and maximal values, malformed inputs where applicable) are either explicitly handled or logically impossible.  
   - No scenarios lead to undefined, silent, or erroneous behavior for any valid input within the declared domain.

6. **Logical Coherence and Semantic Consistency**  
   - No contradictions, such as use-before-assignment, conflicting conditions assumed true simultaneously, or inconsistent data states.  
   - Steps align logically toward fulfilling the stated goal, maintaining internal data structure consistency and avoiding ambiguous state transitions.

7. **Direct Implementability Without Interpretation or Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode is fully implementation-ready—with all index ranges, initializations, iterations, and result constructions detailed explicitly.  
   - It can be translated line-by-line into a concrete programming language without any need for guesses, assumptions, added details, or external knowledge.

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single uninterrupted string of digits (no spaces, newline, or punctuation).  
- Digits correspond in sequence to each pseudocode input.  
- For each: output `1` if the pseudocode is fully reproducible per all the above criteria; otherwise output `0`.  
- Output only the resulting digit string, nothing else—no explanations, scores, comments, or partial indications.

---

### Important Notes (for internal judgment only; do not output):

- Any required assumption, inference, or supplementation leads to a `0`.  
- Ambiguity, missing explicit details, or incomplete edge case coverage cause `0`.  
- Reliance on implicit platform, language, or environmental knowledge disqualifies reproducibility (`0`).  
- Undefined or infinite loops, ambiguous termination, or logically incomplete branches cause `0`.  
- Each pseudocode must be judged independently according to the above strict binary rule.

---

### Summary:

Only output `1` for pseudocode that can be straightforwardly, faithfully implemented to pass **all** valid unit tests **without requiring any further inference or knowledge beyond the given pseudocode**. Otherwise, output `0`.  
The result is a strict binary vector reflecting reproducibility of each input pseudocode.

---

**Example outputs:**  
- Single fully reproducible pseudocode → output: `1`  
- Single incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first and third are reproducible, second is not → output: `101`

**Strictly no output other than the concatenated reproducibility digits.**
