Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to independently assess each for **strict full reproducibility** such that a direct, faithful implementation from the pseudocode alone will pass **all valid unit tests**—including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases—without any exception, inference, or external knowledge.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit (concatenated in input order with no spaces or extra characters):

- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode satisfies *all* of the following, ensuring it is fully implementation-ready and will reliably pass all valid unit tests exactly as specified,  
- Output **0** otherwise (if *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, missing detail, unstated assumption, or unclear behavior exists).

### Explicit Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be satisfied):

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification**  
 • All variables, parameters, data structures, constants, functions, and return values are fully declared or unambiguously inferable with no guesswork.  
 • Inputs and outputs—including their types, formats, valid ranges, and structure—are clearly defined or logically derivable solely from the pseudocode.  
 • No use or mention of undeclared or unspecified external libraries, functions, global states, or environment dependencies.

2. **Unambiguous and Exhaustive Control Flow and Logic**  
 • All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) have explicit, well-defined iteration/recursion bounds, termination conditions, and prevention of infinite or undefined execution.  
 • All possible input cases are covered explicitly or logically (e.g., all branches and cases). No implicit assumptions about inputs or fallback behaviors.  
 • No vague, placeholder, or high-level descriptions without concrete algorithmic steps or unqualified directives like “handle errors” without exact treatment.

3. **Deterministic, Precise Operations and Data Manipulation**  
 • Data mutations, indexing, arithmetic, and side effects are explicitly described with clear and consistent semantics.  
 • The indexing base (zero- or one-based) is clearly stated or made consistent and unambiguous throughout.  
 • Evaluation order, data updates, and state changes are precise and leave no ambiguity in implementation or behavior.

4. **Self-Contained, Context-Free Description**  
 • The pseudocode is fully self-sufficient with no hidden dependencies on platform-specific, language-specific, or domain-specific knowledge beyond what is explicitly stated.  
 • All assumptions, constraints, or special cases are declared within the pseudocode or are logically deductible (not requiring unstated external context).

5. **Explicit and Thorough Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
 • Edge scenarios (empty inputs, minimal/max values, invalid formats when applicable) are either explicitly handled or proven impossible within given constraints.  
 • No input leads to undefined, silent failures, ambiguous results, infinite loops, or uncaught errors.

6. **Logical Consistency, Coherence, and Semantic Integrity**  
 • No contradictions (e.g., use-before-assignment, conflicting simultaneous conditions, inconsistent data states).  
 • All steps clearly contribute toward the intended overall functionality without ambiguity or logical gaps.

7. **Direct, Deterministic Implementability Without Interpretation or External Supplementation**  
 • Every step, index range, initialization, iteration, and result construction is explicitly detailed.  
 • Translation to concrete programming language code is possible line-by-line *without* guessing, adding details, or incorporating outside information.

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple inputs, output a single string of digits corresponding to the inputs in order, with no separators or formatting—only the concatenated digits.  
- Output `1` for a reproducible pseudocode input meeting all above criteria; otherwise output `0`.  
- Output only this digit string, nothing else—no explanation, annotation, warnings, or partial scores.

---

### Important (internal guidance for your judgment; do not output):

- Any need for inference, assumption, or supplementation must yield a `0`.  
- Ambiguity, missing data, undefined behavior, or incomplete edge case coverage mandates `0`.  
- External knowledge or implicit platform/language assumptions disqualify reproducibility (`0`).  
- Invalid or infinite loops, ambiguous termination, or incomplete branches require `0`.  
- Evaluate each pseudocode independently against the above strict binary criteria.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` **only** if the pseudocode is fully explicit, detailed, unambiguous, and self-contained to guarantee that a direct implementation will pass **all** valid unit tests, **without** any assumptions or guesses. Otherwise, output `0`.

---

**Examples:**  
- Single reproducible pseudocode → `1`  
- Single ambiguous or incomplete pseudocode → `0`  
- Three pseudocodes, first & third reproducible, second not → `101`

---

**Strictly output only the final concatenated digit string representing reproducibility of each pseudocode in input order, and nothing else.**
