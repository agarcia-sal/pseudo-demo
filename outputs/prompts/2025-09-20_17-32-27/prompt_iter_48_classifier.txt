Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently and precisely determine whether each is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be directly implemented from the pseudocode alone, without gaps or ambiguity, and will reliably pass **all** valid unit tests, including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit per input, concatenated sequentially with no spaces, punctuation, or extra characters:

- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is rigorously complete, explicit, consistent, and self-contained such that an implementation faithful to it must pass every valid unit test automatically;
- Output **0** if the pseudocode is missing any essential detail, contains ambiguity, lacks exhaustive handling of edge/error cases, requires assumptions or external knowledge, or otherwise cannot guarantee universal test passage without further interpretation.

---

### Definitive Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be met):

1. **Complete, Explicit, and Unambiguous Specification**  
   - All variables, data types, structures, functions, parameters, constants, and return values are clearly defined or directly and unequivocally inferable from the pseudocode without assumption.  
   - Input and output formats, types, ranges, and constraints are explicitly stated or derivable solely from the pseudocode, with no hidden preconditions or undefined domains.  
   - No references to undeclared external functions, APIs, global state, libraries, or environmental behaviors.

2. **Fully Determined Control Flow and Logic**  
   - All control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals) specify explicit iteration ranges, termination conditions, and exhaustive case coverage so there is no ambiguity in processing or potential infinite loops unaccounted for.  
   - Branching comprehensively covers all input conditions; no implicit or assumed default behaviors.  
   - Algorithmic steps are fully spelled-out; no vague instructions like “handle accordingly” without precise procedural detail.

3. **Exact and Consistent Operations and Data Handling**  
   - Indices, arithmetic, data mutations, and side effects are described with exact semantics, including clear indexing bases (0-based or 1-based), consistent use throughout, and ordering of evaluation.  
   - No ambiguous or underspecified operations or order-dependencies.  
   - Steps and expressions yield deterministic outputs unambiguously for any input in the problem domain.

4. **Self-Contained with No External Dependencies or Implicit Assumptions**  
   - Pseudocode is a standalone specification; no reliance on platform-dependent behavior, unspecified domain knowledge, hidden environment assumptions, or external context beyond inputs and described operations.  
   - All assumptions, if any, are explicitly declared within the pseudocode text itself.

5. **Exhaustive Handling of Normal, Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - The pseudocode explicitly handles or justifiably excludes all edge cases (empty inputs, minimum/maximum values, malformed inputs where relevant).  
   - No inputs within the defined domain can produce unhandled cases, undefined states, errors, or silent failures.

6. **Logical and Semantic Consistency Without Contradictions**  
   - No logical contradictions such as use-before-initialization, conflicting conditions, inconsistent state updates, or impossible simultaneous assumptions.  
   - Internal data structures and variables maintain consistent, well-defined states throughout execution.

7. **Direct and Complete Implementability Without Interpretation or Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode is sufficiently detailed for line-by-line translation into any standard programming language with no guesswork or requirements for additional details.  
   - No placeholders, omissions, or instructions requiring external reasoning.

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output one digit per input in the exact order given, with no spaces, newlines, or any other characters.  
- Output only the concatenated string of '1' and '0' digits, nothing else.

---

### Additional Internal Guidelines (do not output):

- If any detail requires inference, environmental knowledge, or external assumption, output **0**.  
- Ambiguity, missing edge case coverage, partial or underspecified logic calls for **0**.  
- Implicit platform, indexing, or language assumptions cause **0**.  
- Undefined or infinite loops, incomplete control flow, or logical inconsistency yield **0**.  
- Pseudocodes are evaluated independently.

---

### Summary:

Output **1** strictly when the pseudocode can be implemented verbatim to pass all valid unit tests without any additional knowledge or assumptions. Otherwise, output **0**. The resulting string reflects reproducibility status of each input pseudocode precisely.

---

### Example outputs:  
- Single fully reproducible pseudocode: `1`  
- Single incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first and third are reproducible, second is not: `101`

**Strictly no other output beyond the digit string.**
