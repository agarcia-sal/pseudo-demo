Given one or more pseudocode inputs, evaluate each independently to determine if it is **strictly reproducible**, meaning it can be implemented exactly as given, with no ambiguity, omission, or external assumptions, and will surely pass **all possible unit tests** (including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases), with no exceptions or failures.

For each pseudocode, output a single digit in sequence (concatenated into one uninterrupted string, with no spaces, newlines, or other characters):

- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is fully precise, complete, and unambiguous such that a direct, line-by-line implementation without any guesswork or external inference will pass every valid test case.
- Output **0** otherwise (if any ambiguity, incompleteness, hidden assumptions, under-specified details, missing edge case handling, vague operations, or context dependence exists).

---

### Rigorous Criteria for Strict Reproducibility (all must be satisfied):

1. **Complete Declaration and Explicit Typing**  
   - All inputs, outputs, parameters, variables, data structures, functions, and constants are fully declared or clearly and unambiguously inferable solely from the pseudocode.  
   - Types, valid value ranges, data shapes, and structures are precisely specified or perfectly deducible without assumptions.  
   - No references to external libraries, hidden states, global variables, or undefined functions.

2. **Fully Specified Logic and Deterministic Control Flow**  
   - All control flow constructs (loops, recursion, conditionals) include exact iteration counts, index ranges, termination criteria, and exhaustive branch coverage for every possible input scenario.  
   - No infinite loops, ambiguous termination conditions, or unspecifiable halting behavior.  
   - All logical pathways are explicit and collectively exhaustive with no unspecified or implicit branches.

3. **Precise, Unambiguous Operations and State Updates**  
   - All operations, including indexing, arithmetic, data manipulations, and side effects, are defined with exact semantics, including indexing base (0 or 1) declared or evident and used consistently throughout.  
   - Evaluation order and update sequencing are either explicitly stated or deterministically implied with no ambiguous or concurrent side effects.

4. **Standalone and Self-Contained**  
   - The pseudocode requires zero external context, domain knowledge, environment-specific behavior, or assumptions beyond what it explicitly states.  
   - The solution is fully self-sufficient and portable, with all dependencies declared or directly represented within the pseudocode.

5. **Exhaustive Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - All edge cases—including empty inputs, minimal and maximal values, invalid or malformed inputs (if applicable)—are either explicitly handled or logically impossible within the stated domain.  
   - No possibility exists for silent failures, undefined behaviors, crashes, or incomplete error handling.

6. **Internal Consistency and Logical Coherence**  
   - No contradictory statements or conflicting conditions.  
   - No use-before-assignment, no inconsistent state, and data integrity is maintained perfectly throughout.  
   - The flow of computation logically advances toward the stated goal without gaps or unreachable/ambiguous states.

7. **Direct and Unambiguous Implementability**  
   - The pseudocode is ready for direct translation into an executable program line-by-line, requiring zero supplemental information, inference, or assumptions.  
   - All initialization, iterations, updates, and final outputs are completely specified and bounded.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single concatenated string of digits (e.g., `1010` for four inputs), preserving the input order.  
- Output only the digit string, nothing else—no explanations, comments, or partial scores.

---

### Additional Clarifications (for internal judgment only; DO NOT OUTPUT):

- Any missing explicit detail, ambiguous terminology, necessary inference, or vague phrasing leads to output `0`.  
- Implicit or unspecified assumptions about data types, indexing conventions, external definitions, or environmental context lead to `0`.  
- Partial or incomplete treatment of edge or error scenarios leads to `0`.  
- Unclear control flow termination or potentially infinite loops lead to `0`.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` **only** for pseudocode that can be faithfully and immediately implemented to pass **all** test cases fully and correctly without any external inference or need for interpretation. Otherwise, output `0`. The output is a strict binary reproducibility vector corresponding to each pseudocode input.

---

**Example outputs:**  
- One completely reproducible pseudocode: output `1`  
- One ambiguous or incomplete pseudocode: output `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first and last are reproducible, second is not: output `101`

---

**Strictly no output other than the concatenated reproducibility digits.**
