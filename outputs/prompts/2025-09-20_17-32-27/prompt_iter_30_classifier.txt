Given one or more pseudocode inputs, evaluate each independently to determine whether it is **fully and unambiguously reproducible** to the extent that it can be directly implemented precisely as given, without requiring any assumptions, inferences, or external knowledge, and will pass **all valid unit tests** (normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) without fail.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit (concatenated in input order, with no spaces, punctuation, line breaks, or extra characters):  
- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode satisfies all the criteria below, guaranteeing a fully deterministic, comprehensive, and immediately implementable solution that unquestionably passes all unit tests.  
- Otherwise, output `0`.

---

### Absolute Criteria for Outputting `1` (all must hold):

**1. Full Explicitness & Completeness**  
- Every variable, function, parameter, return type, data structure, constant, and input/output specification (including types, formats, and valid ranges) is completely defined or unambiguously derivable solely from the pseudocode itself.  
- No references to undefined or undocumented external functions, libraries, states, global variables, or platform-dependent behavior.  
- Input and output are specified so clearly that no supplemental assumptions or clarifications are needed.

**2. Strict Determinacy & Precision**  
- All operations, data manipulations, indexing, assignments, arithmetic, and side effects are precisely and consistently specified with clear semantics, including explicit indexing bases (zero- or one-based) maintained rigorously throughout.  
- Evaluation order, control flow, and state changes are fully determined and unambiguous—no vague or underspecified instructions remain.  
- No implicit or ambiguous instructions such as "handle errors" or "process accordingly" without exact algorithmic description.

**3. Exhaustive & Complete Control Flow Coverage**  
- All loops, recursions, and conditionals have clearly defined, explicit boundaries, termination conditions, and invariants ensuring no infinite loops or undefined halts.  
- Branching logic covers all possible input cases exhaustively, with no logical gaps, missing cases, or fallback left unspecified.

**4. Self-Contained & Context-Free**  
- The entire solution can be understood and implemented independently, without relying on hidden domain knowledge, environment-specific features, or unspecified external context.  
- Any dependencies or assumptions are explicitly stated or logically derivable from the pseudocode text itself.

**5. Explicit Handling of All Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
- Edge cases such as empty inputs, minimal/maximal valid values, or malformed inputs (where applicable) are either handled explicitly with clear logic or properly excluded by well-defined input specifications.  
- No valid input scenario leads to undefined behavior, errors, silent failures, or infinite execution.

**6. Logical and Semantic Consistency**  
- No internal contradictions such as use-before-initialization, conflicting or mutually exclusive conditions assumed together, or logically impossible states.  
- Data structure invariants and program state transitions are coherent and consistent throughout the logic.  
- The algorithmic steps clearly and logically lead toward the stated output goal without ambiguity.

**7. Ready for Direct Implementation**  
- The pseudocode is implementation-ready: all initializations, index ranges, iterations, and return constructions are explicitly detailed.  
- No part of the pseudocode relies on guessing, interpretation, supplementation, or adding details beyond what is presented.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single uninterrupted string of digits, each digit corresponding exactly to one input's reproducibility result, in the same order as inputs.  
- Output only the digit string, no spaces, no newlines, no punctuation, no explanations or partial gradings.

---

### Internal Judgment Notes (do not output):

- Any implicit assumption, missing or ambiguous detail, external dependency, or underspecified evaluation causes output `0`.  
- Pseudocode must be judged strictly independently, no cross-sample inference.  
- If any logical, control flow, or semantic gap exists, output `0`.  
- Thorough coverage of all edge and error handling is mandatory to output `1`.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` only if the pseudocode can be implemented exactly as given, guaranteed to pass **all** unit tests without any further explanation, inference, or external knowledge. Otherwise, output `0`.

---

**Example**:  
- Input: single fully reproducible pseudocode → `1`  
- Input: single incomplete/ambiguous pseudocode → `0`  
- Input: three pseudocodes, only first and third reproducible → `101`

---

**Strictly output only the concatenated reproducibility digits.**
