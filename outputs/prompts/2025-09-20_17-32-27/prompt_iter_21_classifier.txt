Given one or more pseudocode inputs, evaluate each **independently** for strict **full reproducibility**: that is, verify whether a direct, literal implementation of the pseudocode as given—without any assumptions, interpretations, external knowledge, or added detail—will pass **all valid unit tests** (normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) in every scenario, without failing or producing undefined behavior.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit **per input** concatenated in the input order, with no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or extra characters:  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** of the conditions listed below fully and explicitly, ensuring guaranteed pass on all tests by direct implementation.  
- Output **0** otherwise (if any ambiguity, incompleteness, missing specification, external dependency, logical gap, or implicit assumption exists).

---

### Rigorously Required Criteria for Outputting 1 (all must be satisfied):

1. **Explicit, Complete, and Self-Contained Specification**  
   - All functions, variables, parameters, data types, and structures are clearly defined or unambiguously inferable solely from the pseudocode; no reliance on outside definitions or conventions.  
   - Inputs and outputs are described with explicit types, valid domains, formats, and structures or clearly derivable with no open-ended assumptions.  
   - No references to external libraries, hidden globals, unspecified helper functions, or environment/platform specifics.

2. **Fully-Specified, Deterministic Control Flow and Logic**  
   - All loops have explicit initialization, termination conditions, and guarantee to terminate (no infinite or ambiguous cycles).  
   - Branching/decision structures comprehensively cover **every possible** input or state case without gaps or underspecification.  
   - Every action, assignment, and operation is fully detailed—no vague phrases like “handle appropriately”, “process accordingly”, or omitted error handling.

3. **Unambiguous and Precise Operations and Data Handling**  
   - All indexing (zero-based or one-based) and data manipulations are explicitly defined and consistently used throughout.  
   - Data mutations, temporal order of operations, and side effects are clearly expressed with no ambiguity or implicit evaluation order assumptions.  
   - Arithmetic, logical, and data operations have defined semantics consistent with standard conventions or clearly stated otherwise.

4. **Complete Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Handling**  
   - Explicit handling (or proof of impossibility) for empty inputs, minimal/maximal input values, boundary conditions, and invalid or malformed inputs where applicable.  
   - No undefined behavior, silent failures, or unchecked invalid states possible under any valid inputs.

5. **Logical Coherence and Absence of Contradictions**  
   - No conflicting assumptions, use-before-definition, or runtime states that cannot be reached consistently.  
   - Algorithmic steps clearly progress toward stated objectives with consistent internal states at every step.

6. **Direct Implementability Without Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode can be translated into a working program line-by-line without guessing meanings, filling gaps, or adding unstated logic or initialization.  
   - All necessary intermediate data, initial conditions, and computations are fully described.

7. **Complete and Consistent Terminology and Naming**  
   - No ambiguous references, unclear variable roles, or inconsistent terminology.  
   - All indices, loops, and data element accesses are named or numbered clearly and consistently.

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single concatenated string of digits (no spaces, newlines, comments, or any other characters).  
- Each digit corresponds sequentially to the reproducibility decision of the matching input pseudocode.  
- Exactly one digit per input, strictly `1` or `0`.  
- Output **nothing else**.

---

### Critical Enforcement Rules (internal judgment, do not output):

- **Any** reliance on unstated assumptions, necessary inferences, or missing details → output `0`.  
- Ambiguous, vague, or incomplete logic or control flow → output `0`.  
- Implicit or missing edge case handling → output `0`.  
- Undefined loops or ambiguous termination → output `0`.  
- Dependence on external context, environment, or language/platform specifics → output `0`.  
- Inconsistency or contradictions in variable usage, indexing, or state → output `0`.  
- Partial or incomplete instructions that require interpretation or supplementation → output `0`.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` **only if** the pseudocode can be implemented literally as given **without any interpretation or addition** and will pass **all** unit tests for **all** valid inputs. Otherwise, output `0`. The outputs collectively form a strict binary sequence reflecting reproducibility per input pseudocode, preserving input order.

---

**Example Outputs:**  
- Single fully reproducible pseudocode → `1`  
- Single pseudocode with any ambiguity or omission → `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first and third are reproducible, second is not → `101`

---

**Strictly no other output beyond the concatenated string of digits is allowed.**
