Given one or more pseudocode inputs, evaluate each pseudocode independently for **strict and complete reproducibility**. For each input, output **1** if and only if the pseudocode, as provided, is entirely sufficient to create a direct, unambiguous implementation that will pass **all** valid unit tests (including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) without any need for additional assumptions, clarifications, or external knowledge. Output **0** otherwise.

### Detailed Reproducibility Assessment Criteria (all must be met):

1. **Fully Specified Inputs and Outputs**  
 - Every input and output (types, valid domains, data structures, and formats) is explicitly or *unambiguously inferable* from the pseudocode alone.  
 - No missing or vaguely described parameters or results.  
 - No implicit references to external data, environment, or hidden inputs/outputs.

2. **Complete Declaration and Scoping of Variables and Functions**  
 - All variables, intermediate structures, helper functions, and constants are clearly defined or unambiguously deducible at the point of use.  
 - No reliance on undeclared elements, global state, or external libraries unless fully described in the pseudocode.

3. **Explicit and Exhaustive Control Flow**  
 - All loops and recursion include clear initialization, precise boundary conditions, and well-defined termination conditions guaranteeing no infinite or undefined behavior.  
 - All conditional branches explicitly cover every possible input scenario — no gaps, no partially handled cases, no hidden fallbacks.  
 - All algorithmic steps are fully spelled out without vague placeholders such as "handle as needed," "process accordingly," or other underspecified instructions.

4. **Consistent and Deterministic Operations**  
 - Indexing schemes (zero-based, one-based, etc.) are clearly stated or consistently applied throughout.  
 - Data operations (reads, writes, updates, mutations) have fully defined semantics without ambiguity in order or effect.  
 - No underspecified or ambiguous evaluation sequences or side effects.

5. **Self-Contained and Context-Free**  
 - The pseudocode can be implemented and executed on a standard platform *without any external assumptions or domain knowledge.*  
 - No implicit dependencies on platform-specific behavior, hardware quirks, or external state beyond what is explicitly described.

6. **Thorough Edge Case and Error Handling**  
 - All relevant edge, boundary, minimal, maximal, empty, and error inputs are explicitly handled or logically impossible.  
 - No silent failures, undefined states, or partial handling of invalid inputs within the declared input domain.

7. **Internal Logical Consistency and Semantic Soundness**  
 - No contradictions or misuses such as variables used before assignment, conflicting conditional logic, or inconsistent data states.  
 - Algorithmic steps coherently and logically progress toward fulfilling the stated goals with clear data and state transitions.

8. **Direct Mapping to Implementable Code**  
 - The pseudocode can be mechanically translated into executable code line-by-line without requiring interpretation, guessing, or supplementation.  
 - Any complex or compound statements are fully broken down into precise procedural steps.

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a **single uninterrupted string** of digits (`1` or `0`), in the **same order** as the inputs were provided.  
- Output only the digit string. No extra text, explanation, punctuation, whitespace, or formatting.  
- For each input, output `1` if it meets *all* above criteria; otherwise output `0`.

---

### Important:

- **Any** need to infer, assume, supplement, or guess details results in `0`.  
- Ambiguity, underspecification, incomplete edge or error handling, or implicit dependencies cause `0`.  
- Undefined or potentially infinite loops, partial or missing branches, or logically inconsistent code cause `0`.  
- Each pseudocode input is judged **independently** and absolutely against these standards.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` only for pseudocode that is a fully explicit, coherent, completely specified, self-sufficient, and precisely detailed recipe guaranteed to pass all valid unit tests without any external interpretation. Otherwise `0`.

---

**Examples:**  
- One perfectly reproducible pseudocode: output `1`  
- One incomplete pseudocode: output `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where the first and last are fully reproducible, the second is not: output `101`

**Strictly no output other than the concatenated string of 0 and 1 digits.**
