Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to determine **with absolute certainty** whether each pseudocode is **fully reproducible**—that is, it can be directly and unambiguously implemented to pass **all valid unit tests covering every typical, edge, boundary, and exceptional case without any guesswork, assumptions, or missing information**.

For each pseudocode, output exactly one digit:  
- `1` if and only if the pseudocode satisfies **all** the criteria below, ensuring deterministic, complete, and executable logic;  
- `0` otherwise.

### Criteria for Full Reproducibility (All must be strictly met):

1. **Explicit Definitions and Interfaces**  
   - All variables, parameters (with types if relevant), constants, data structures, and functions are clearly declared or can be precisely inferred without ambiguity.  
   - Input formats, parameter types, return types, and output specifications are fully stated or follow clearly standardized conventions.  
   - No reliance on unspecified external functions, libraries, global variables, or contextual knowledge beyond what the pseudocode itself provides.

2. **Complete, Deterministic, and Unambiguous Control Flow**  
   - Every control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion) includes fully defined entry, exit, and iteration criteria, guaranteed to terminate unless explicitly justified.  
   - All decision branches exhaustively cover every logical possibility—no case or condition is left open or implicitly handled.  
   - Statements and operations are precisely described without vague phrasing (e.g., avoid “handle accordingly,” “process as needed”) or incomplete instructions.

3. **Deterministic Computation and Data Handling**  
   - All data accesses, indexings, calculations, and state changes are clearly and concretely specified, with well-defined conventions and no room for interpretation (e.g., zero- vs one-based indexing explicitly stated or clearly consistent).  
   - Side effects or state modifications are explicit and described sufficiently for faithful re-implementation.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Independent**  
   - The pseudocode must stand alone with no dependencies on external environment details, platform-specific behavior, or implicit domain knowledge beyond what is presented.  
   - No hidden assumptions or referenced knowledge outside the pseudocode itself.

5. **Explicit Exhaustive Handling of Edge and Error Conditions**  
   - All boundary cases, minimal inputs, empty or malformed data, and exceptional scenarios are dealt with explicitly or proven impossible by logic.  
   - No undefined or unsafe behaviors, silent failures, or error conditions exist for any valid input within the declared input domain.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Clarity**  
   - No contradictions such as using variables before initialization or mutually exclusive conditions assumed simultaneously true.  
   - Steps and modifications align coherently to produce the intended output, respecting the declared input-output contract.  
   - Data integrity (e.g., for collections) is clearly preserved without ambiguity or race conditions.

7. **Ready for Direct, Line-by-Line Implementation**  
   - Every detail needed to implement the pseudocode as-is in a real programming language exists: iteration bounds, loop variables initialization, condition checks, data structure construction, and final output formation are fully expressed.  
   - No need for supplementation, supplementation, or interpretation by the implementer.

### Output Instructions:

- When multiple pseudocodes are provided sequentially, output one digit per pseudocode in the exact input order, concatenated into a single string without spaces, line breaks, or other characters.  
- Output only digits `1` or `0`, nothing else or extra.  
- Do NOT provide explanations, confidence scores, or partial credit; the decision is strictly binary.

---

### Strict Evaluation Notes (Do not output):

- Any ambiguity, incomplete definitions, or reliance on assumed correctness but not explicitly demonstrated must result in `0`.  
- Precision and explicitness are paramount; styling, verbosity, or language formality are irrelevant.  
- Infinite loops or non-terminating constructs without explicit termination rationale fail reproducibility.  
- Lack of explicit edge case handling or undefined behavior under boundary inputs cause failure.  
- Each pseudocode must be evaluated independently and absolutely against these standards.

---

### Summary

Output a binary string where each digit signals whether the corresponding pseudocode is **guaranteed reproducible without any additional assumptions or clarifications** (`1`) or not (`0`). Only strictly self-sufficient, unambiguous, fully detailed pseudocodes earn a `1`.

---

**Example:**  
- 1 pseudocode fully defined → `1`  
- 1 pseudocode ambiguous or incomplete → `0`  
- 3 pseudocodes where only 1st and 3rd are fully reproducible → `101`

---

**Reminder:** Output strictly and only the binary string (digits 0 or 1) corresponding to the input order of pseudocodes, nothing else.
