Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently evaluate each to determine if it is **fully reproducible**, meaning it can be precisely and unambiguously implemented as given and will pass **all valid unit tests** (normal, edge, boundary, error cases) without any supplementary assumptions or external knowledge.

For each input pseudocode, output a single digit:  
- **1** if and only if the pseudocode is completely explicit, exhaustive, logically consistent, and self-contained so that a direct, line-by-line implementation inevitably passes **every** valid unit test without error,  
- **0** otherwise (including any ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumptions, missing edge/error case coverage, or reliance on outside context).

---

### Comprehensive Reproducibility Requirements (all must be met):

1. **Complete Explicitness and Declarations**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, parameters, data structures, functions, and constants are clearly declared or perfectly inferable without assumptions.  
   - Input/output formats, data types, valid value domains, and structures are explicitly defined or fully derivable from the pseudocode itself.  
   - No references to undeclared identifiers, external libraries, platform-specific features, side effects outside the pseudocode, or hidden global state.

2. **Unambiguous, Fully-Specified Control Flow & Logic**  
   - Control statements (loops, conditionals, recursion) contain fully defined initializations, conditions, invariants, and termination criteria ensuring no infinite or undefined loops.  
   - All branching logic covers **all** possible input values and states exhaustively, with no unspecified or vague fallback or error handling.  
   - Every operation step (comparisons, assignments, calculations, list manipulations) is detailed explicitly, with no placeholders such as “handle appropriately” or “process accordingly” without rigorous specification.

3. **Deterministic, Precise Operations and State Management**  
   - Indexing schemes (zero-based or one-based) and data mutations are stated explicitly or clearly consistent throughout the pseudocode.  
   - Operation order, evaluation sequence, and side effect implications are fully articulated to avoid ambiguity or interpretation.  
   - Data structure modifications, variable updates, or function calls have explicitly defined effects and outcomes within the pseudocode, without implicit or probabilistic behavior.

4. **Totally Self-Contained and Context-Free**  
   - The pseudocode functions as a standalone solution, free from any platform, implementation, language, or environmental assumptions, external domain knowledge, or hidden dependencies not explicitly documented.  
   - Any assumptions or constraints are clearly stated in the pseudocode itself; no external “common knowledge” or contextual inference is allowed.

5. **Complete Handling of All Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - All edge cases (including empty, minimal, maximal, malformed, or boundary inputs within the declared valid domain) are either explicitly guarded or logically impossible due to specifications.  
   - No scenario leads to undefined, silent failure, or runtime error behaviors under any valid input within the problem domain.

6. **Logical Coherence and Consistency**  
   - No contradictory statements or logically impossible conditions (e.g., use-before-assignment, conflicting simultaneous conditions) exist.  
   - Data states and transitions are internally consistent and align coherently with the stated problem goal and output requirements.

7. **Direct Implementation Readiness**  
   - The pseudocode is fully ready to implement verbatim, with all indexing, control flow, initialization, iteration, mutation, and result constructions precisely spelled out.  
   - No need for guesswork, supplementation, or external assumptions to translate pseudocode lines into functioning code passing full test coverage.

---

### Output Format:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a **single uninterrupted string of digits** (no spaces, line breaks, punctuation).  
- Each digit corresponds sequentially to each input pseudocode's reproducibility (1 = fully reproducible, 0 = not reproducible).  
- Output strictly and only this digit string, absolutely nothing else—no explanations, comments, or partial scores.

---

### Internal Judging Rules (do not output):

- Any requirement to infer, supplement, or assume missing details yields output `0`.  
- Ambiguity, underspecification, or incomplete handling of any valid input or edge case yields output `0`.  
- Implicit reliance on platform, language, environment, or hidden state disqualifies with `0`.  
- Undefined or infinite loops, ambiguous termination conditions, or unhandled branches yield `0`.  
- Minor wording differences are ignored if strict clarity and implementability remain intact without guesswork.  
- Each pseudocode is judged independently and absolutely strictly under these rules.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` only if a direct, literal implementation of the pseudocode guarantees passing **all valid unit tests** for **every** case without any guesswork, supplementation, or external assumptions. Otherwise output `0`.

---

### Examples:

- Single, fully explicit and complete pseudocode → output: `1`  
- Single ambiguous or incomplete pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Multiple inputs with reproducible first and third, non-reproducible second → output: `101`

**Strictly no output except the concatenated reproducibility digits.**
