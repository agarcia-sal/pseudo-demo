Given one or more pseudocode inputs, determine for each whether it is **fully reproducible**, i.e., can be implemented exactly as given to pass **all valid unit tests** including all edge, boundary, and exceptional cases.

For each pseudocode, output **1** if it meets **all** these strict criteria, else **0**:

1. **Complete and explicit**:  
   - All variables, functions, data structures, and procedural steps are fully specified with no undefined elements or implicit assumptions.  
   - Control flow (loops, branches, recursion) is fully described and unambiguous.

2. **Deterministic and precise**:  
   - Instructions enable a direct one-to-one translation into a working implementation.  
   - No vague language, guesswork, or missing decision rules remain.  
   - All expressions, conditions, computations, and mutations are clearly defined.

3. **Self-contained and context-independent**:  
   - The pseudocode fully defines inputs and outputs in type and format or provides a direct way to derive them.  
   - No external data, knowledge, or environment assumptions beyond the pseudocode itself.  
   - No dependencies on undefined helper functions or external libraries.

4. **Comprehensive edge case handling**:  
   - Explicit or logically implied treatment of boundary conditions, minimal inputs, empty/no data, or exceptional scenarios ensuring robustness.

5. **Consistent logical correctness**:  
   - No contradictory statements, unreachable code, infinite loops without exit, or semantic conflicts.  
   - Variables are neither read before initialization nor miss assigned.

**Output instructions:**  
- For multiple pseudocode inputs given in sequence, output a string of digits (one digit per pseudocode, in input order), each digit being either:  
   - `1` if the pseudocode is fully reproducible as defined, or  
   - `0` otherwise.  
- Output only the concatenated digits, no spaces, explanations, or any additional text.

Assume no external information beyond the pseudocode itself.  
Make only absolute, binary judgments â€” partial correctness or probable reproducibility = 0.

**Examples:**  
`1`  
`0`  
`101` (for three pseudocodes in input order)
