Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently assess each for **strict full reproducibility**, defined as the ability to be implemented exactly as given—without any ambiguity, missing information, external assumptions, or implicit knowledge—and guaranteed to pass **all valid unit tests** (including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) flawlessly.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit (zero or one) concatenated in the exact input order with no spaces, punctuation, or extra characters:  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is fully detailed, complete, and unambiguous for direct line-by-line implementation to pass every valid unit test without requiring any inference, supplementation, or external context.  
- Output **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, underspecified, uses assumptions, omits edge/error case handling, or otherwise fails any strict reproducibility criterion.

---

### Absolute Criteria for Labeling an Input as Fully Reproducible (all must hold):

1. **Explicit, Complete Declarations and Definitions**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, functions, data structures, and return types are distinctly introduced or unambiguously inferable solely from the pseudocode.  
   - Types, valid value domains, and structures of inputs and outputs are clearly specified or derivable without guesswork.  
   - No reliance on unexplained external libraries, implicit global states, or hidden dependencies.

2. **Fully Specified, Deterministic Logic and Control Flow**  
   - Every control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion) has clear, precise boundaries, termination conditions, and iteration details with no possibility of infinite or undetermined execution.  
   - All branches exhaustively cover every scenario with no gaps, implicit handling, or ambiguous decisions.  
   - Each step and operation is described with exact algorithmic semantics—no vague or placeholder instructions such as “handle error”, “process accordingly”, or “update as needed” without explicit mechanisms.

3. **Unambiguous, Consistent Operations and Conventions**  
   - All computations, indexing schemes (explicitly zero- or one-based), state updates, data accesses, and side effects have exact, unambiguous definitions and consistent application throughout the pseudocode.  
   - No underspecified evaluation orders, nondeterministic effects, or reliance on implicit language/platform semantics.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Independent Presentation**  
   - The pseudocode fully encapsulates the solution without requiring any external knowledge, domain expertise, environmental assumptions, or platform-specific details beyond what is stated.  
   - All assumptions, constraints, and dependencies are explicitly declared or logically deducible within the pseudocode.

5. **Thorough Handling of All Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - Every possible edge condition (empty inputs, minimum/maximum values, invalid or malformed data if applicable) is either explicitly handled or impossible under declared constraints.  
   - No input within the declared domain can cause undefined, incomplete, silent failures, or runtime errors.

6. **Logical Coherence, Semantic Consistency, and Internal Soundness**  
   - No contradictions (e.g., conflicting variable states, simultaneous conflicting conditions), no use-before-assignment, and no logically impossible states appear throughout the flow.  
   - The computational steps align coherently toward the stated output goal, preserving internal structure and state invariants consistently.

7. **Direct, Line-by-Line Implementability Without Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode can be faithfully translated into a concrete programming language exactly as given, requiring no additional assumptions, external detail, or guesswork for indexing, initialization, iteration, or output construction.  
   - No conceptual gaps or ambiguous constructs needing interpretation beyond the pseudocode text.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single uninterrupted string of digits (0s and 1s), corresponding precisely in order to the inputs given.  
- Output exactly **one digit per input**, nothing else.  
- Output only the concatenated string of digits; do not include explanations, whitespace, punctuation, or any other characters.

---

### Important Internal Judgment Notes (not to output):

- Any reliance on implicit assumptions, external context, or incomplete definitions → **0**  
- Any ambiguity, missing explicit detail, vague steps, or incomplete edge/error case coverage → **0**  
- Underspecification in control flow, indexing, variable usage, or termination → **0**  
- Logical inconsistencies or contradictions anywhere → **0**  
- Only pseudocode passing all criteria stringently without exception → **1**

---

### Summary:

Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is fully explicit, self-contained, logically sound, and detailed enough for a direct, unambiguous implementation guaranteed to pass all valid unit tests without any guesswork or inference. Otherwise, output **0**.

---

**Example outputs:**  
- Single fully reproducible pseudocode → `1`  
- Single incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first & last reproducible, second not → `101`

---

**Strictly no output other than the uninterrupted string of reproducibility digits.**
