Determine if each given pseudocode snippet is fully reproducible—meaning it can be translated directly into a correct, complete program that will pass every valid unit test (including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) without any external assumptions or added interpretation.

For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one digit with no spaces or extra characters:

- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode fulfills **all** the following strict criteria, guaranteeing full correctness, unambiguity, and direct implementability.

- Output `0` otherwise.

---

### Criteria for Output = 1 (must satisfy all):

1. **Explicit Definitions & Declarations**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, constants, data structures, and subroutines are explicitly defined or logically and unambiguously inferable solely from the code.  
   - Input/output formats, parameter types, and return values are clearly specified or inherently obvious.  
   - No references rely on undefined, external, or implicit elements, including global state, external libraries, or hidden dependencies.

2. **Complete and Precise Logic Flow**  
   - Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) specify exact conditions for start, continuation, termination, and all branching cases.  
   - All possible input and internal states are handled explicitly—no logical gaps, no partial or ambiguous cases.  
   - Every line of pseudocode contributes clearly and deterministically to the outcome; ambiguous phrases such as “handle accordingly,” “process as needed,” or “etc.” are disallowed.

3. **Deterministic, Unambiguous Operations**  
   - All operations, indexing conventions, data accesses, and state changes are precisely described with invariant behavior that can be implemented exactly.  
   - Syntax and semantics are consistent, reflecting standard programming logic without room for divergent interpretations.

4. **Self-Contained Without External Assumptions**  
   - The pseudocode does not require any external knowledge, unstated assumptions, or environment-specific behavior.  
   - Does not depend on platform, language-specific features, or behaviors outside what is explicitly written.

5. **Thorough Handling of Edge Cases and Errors**  
   - All edge conditions, boundary inputs, empty or malformed inputs are either logically impossible or explicitly and correctly handled within the pseudocode.  
   - No possibility of silent failures, undefined behaviors, infinite loops, or runtime errors across valid inputs.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Coherence**  
   - Variables are never used before initialization.  
   - No contradictory or mutually exclusive conditions coexist.  
   - The overall algorithm’s steps logically align with the stated goal and ensure correctness.  
   - Data structure modifications maintain internal consistency without ambiguity.

7. **Ready for Direct Implementation**  
   - A developer can implement the pseudocode line-by-line in a programming language without needing to add, guess, or infer missing details.  
   - All iteration indices, ranges, termination conditions, function/subroutine signatures, and result constructions are fully specified.

---

### Output Instructions:

- When multiple pseudocode snippets are provided, output a single concatenated string of digits (`1` or `0`), corresponding precisely and in order to each given pseudocode input.

- Output **only** this string, with no spaces, line breaks, or comments.

---

### Additional Notes (for internal use, do NOT output):

- Any reliance on implied information, likelihood, or common practice (e.g., “likely correct if assumed”) yields output `0`.  
- Do not reward style, elegance, or compactness; precision and unambiguous completeness are paramount.  
- Infinite loops or ambiguous halting conditions mandate an output of `0`.  
- Edge case omissions or unclear error handling must lead to `0`.  
- Evaluate each pseudocode independently.

---

### Summary

Output `1` only for pseudocode that is perfectly specified, logically sound, fully self-contained, and directly implementable to produce a program guaranteed to pass all unit tests without further assumptions. Otherwise, output `0`.

---

**Example:**  
- For 1 fully reproducible pseudocode input → output: `1`  
- For 1 incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- For 3 pseudocodes, reproducible, non-reproducible, reproducible → output: `101`

**Strict binary output only: no explanations or additional text.**
