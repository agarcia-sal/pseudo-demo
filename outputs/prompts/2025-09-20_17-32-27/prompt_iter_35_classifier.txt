Given one or more pseudocode inputs, **independently and without cross-reference**, determine for each if it is **fully reproducible**—that is, whether the pseudocode, taken as-is and without any external assumptions, missing information, or ambiguity, can be implemented directly to pass **all valid unit tests** (including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) flawlessly.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit (`1` or `0`), concatenated in the exact input order, with no spaces, newlines, punctuation, or any other characters:

- Output **`1`** if and only if the pseudocode meets **every** requirement below, enabling a direct, line-by-line implementation passing all tests without any guesswork, supplementation, or external interpretation.
- Output **`0`** otherwise.

---

### Definitive Criteria for Reproducibility (all must hold):

1. **Fully Explicit and Complete Specification**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, parameters, data structures, functions/subroutines, constants, and return types are explicitly defined or trivially inferrable solely from the given pseudocode text.  
   - Inputs/outputs have clear, unambiguous types, formats, and valid ranges or domain boundaries explicitly stated or inherently evident without assumptions.  
   - No references to undeclared elements, undocumented external libraries, hidden global states, or unstated environmental dependencies.

2. **Perfectly Deterministic and Exhaustive Control Flow and Logic**  
   - Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) specify exact bounds, indexing details, initializations, and termination conditions that guarantee halting without infinite loops or undefined behaviors.  
   - All branching conditions cumulatively cover the entire input domain without gaps or implicit default cases.  
   - No vague operations or placeholders that require interpretation such as “handle errors,” “process accordingly,” or “update as needed” without concrete procedural details.

3. **Precise Definition of All Operations and State Changes**  
   - Every data access, mutation, arithmetic operation, indexing, and side-effect is fully described with unambiguous semantics and consistent indexing conventions (zero-based or one-based explicitly given or trivially deducible and then rigorously maintained).  
   - The evaluation order and data dependencies are fully specified so implementations cannot differ.

4. **Self-Contained; Zero External, Contextual, or Platform Assumptions**  
   - The pseudocode can be understood and executed independently, with all necessary logic and data provided within.  
   - No reliance on unstated domain knowledge, platform-specific behavior, language-specific features, or environmental state beyond what is described.

5. **Complete and Explicit Handling of All Edge, Boundary, and Error Conditions**  
   - Every possible input scenario or edge case (e.g., empty inputs, maximum/minimum values, boundary indices, malformed data where applicable) is either explicitly handled or logically impossible given the definition of inputs.  
   - No possible undefined, erroneous, silent, or inconsistent outcomes on any valid input.

6. **Logical and Semantic Consistency Throughout**  
   - No contradictions such as referencing uninitialized values, conflicting state updates, or impossible conditions.  
   - State variables and data structures maintain internal consistency at every step.

7. **Unambiguous and Direct Implementability**  
   - The pseudocode is in a form that can be translated directly into working code, line-by-line, without any need for inference, assumptions, or added reasoning beyond what is explicitly stated.

### Output Instructions:

- For one or more pseudocode inputs given sequentially, output a single uninterrupted string of digits where each digit corresponds to one pseudocode input, in order.  
- Each digit is `1` or `0` per the above criteria.  
- Output **only** this digit string — no explanations, comments, example outputs, or additional text.

---

### Important Internal Notes (do not include in output):

- Any missing explicit detail, ambiguity, or need for implicit assumptions causes output `0`.  
- Partial edge coverage or unspecified scenarios cause output `0`.  
- Dependence on external or environmental knowledge causes output `0`.   
- Ambiguous or infinite loops/recursions cause output `0`.  
- Logical contradictions or inconsistencies cause output `0`.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` only for pseudocode fully precise, explicit, and complete enough to yield a direct, faithful implementation guaranteed to pass **all** unit tests as defined—otherwise output `0` for that pseudocode input. The final output is a strict binary string reflecting reproducibility of each given pseudocode independently.

**Remember:** Output is the exact concatenated reproducibility digits only, no whitespace or other characters.
