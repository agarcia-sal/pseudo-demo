Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to independently evaluate each for **strict reproducibility**—meaning the pseudocode can be implemented exactly as given, without any need for interpretation, supplementation, or assumptions, and will pass **all valid unit tests** (covering normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) flawlessly.

For each pseudocode input, output only a single digit—concatenated without spaces or separators in the input order:

- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is absolutely **complete, precise, and unambiguous**, enabling a direct, line-by-line implementation that guarantees success on **all** valid unit tests without any external knowledge or guesswork.  
- Output **0** otherwise (including any ambiguity, omission, incomplete edge case handling, undefined behavior, reliance on external context, or implicit assumptions).

### Strict Requirements for Reproducibility (all must be satisfied):

1. **Complete Explicit Specification**  
   - All variables, inputs, outputs, data structures, functions, return types, and constants are clearly and explicitly defined or unambiguously derivable from the text alone.  
   - No undeclared elements or references to external libraries, environment states, or hidden assumptions.  
   - Input and output formats, valid ranges, and structural details are fully explicit or logically deducible without presumption.

2. **Exact, Exhaustive Control Flow and Logic**  
   - All loops, conditionals, and recursion have fully defined bounds, termination conditions, and cover every possible input scenario with no implicit or missing branches.  
   - No vague instructions or informal placeholders; every computational step—including error handling—is detailed explicitly.  
   - No possible infinite loops or incomplete halts; termination and progress are assured.

3. **Precise Semantics and Determinism**  
   - All operations—indexing, data mutation, arithmetic, state updates—are exactly specified with clear, consistent conventions (e.g., indexing base and order).  
   - No ambiguous evaluation order or side effects requiring assumptions.  
   - Data mutations and state changes have fully described scope and timing.

4. **Self-Contained and Context-Free**  
   - The pseudocode must be entirely standalone, requiring no external platform, domain knowledge, or environment beyond what is declared or derivable.  
   - All dependencies, constants, and assumptions must be explicitly stated within the pseudocode.

5. **Comprehensive Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Handling**  
   - All edge cases—including empty or minimal and maximal valid inputs, boundary conditions, and malformed inputs when relevant—are either explicitly addressed or logically impossible.  
   - The pseudocode must never exhibit undefined, erroneous, or silent failure behaviors on any valid input.

6. **Logical and Semantic Consistency**  
   - No contradictions (e.g., use-before-assignment, conflicting conditions both assumed true, inconsistent data states).  
   - The logical flow aligns coherently to achieve the stated goal without ambiguous or conflicting descriptions.

7. **Ready for Direct Line-by-Line Implementation**  
   - The pseudocode can be translated exactly as-is into a standard programming language without any missing details or inferred structure.  
   - All initializations, iterations, and result constructions are fully specified without room for guesswork.

---

### Output Format:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single uninterrupted string of `0` and `1` digits.  
- The nth digit corresponds to the reproducibility of the nth pseudocode input.  
- Output strictly nothing else: no explanations, no commentary, no whitespace, no partial scores.

---

### Critical Judgment Notes (do not output):

- Any requirement for external assumptions, guesswork, or supplementation results in `0`.  
- Any ambiguous, incomplete, or missing detail, especially regarding edge cases or operations, results in `0`.  
- Reliance on environment, platform, or unstated domain knowledge results in `0`.  
- Detection of infinite loops or incomplete control flow results in `0`.  
- Pseudocode must be evaluated independently and strictly according to these criteria.

---

### Summary:

Only output `1` if the pseudocode is exactly, fully, and explicitly reproducible to pass every valid unit test without any external inference. Otherwise, output `0`.  
The output forms a strict binary vector reflecting reproducibility of each input.

---

**Examples:**  
- Single fully reproducible pseudocode → output: `1`  
- Single incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where first and third are reproducible, second is not → output: `101`

---

**Absolute requirement: output only the concatenated reproducibility digits, nothing else.**
