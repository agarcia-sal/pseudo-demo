Evaluate each given pseudocode snippet **independently** for full **reproducibility** with respect to passing **all valid unit tests**, including comprehensive edge, boundary, and exceptional cases, **without requiring any assumptions, external knowledge, or inference** beyond what is explicitly stated.

---

For each input pseudocode, output a single digit:

- `1` if and only if every aspect below is fully satisfied, guaranteeing that the pseudocode can be implemented exactly as provided and will pass all valid unit tests;

- Otherwise, output `0`.

Concatenate these digits in input order if multiple pseudocodes are given.

## Rigorous Criteria for Assigning `1` (Fully Reproducible):

1. **Complete and Explicit Definitions**  
    - All variables, data structures, functions, procedures, and parameters are explicitly defined or fully derivable *within* the pseudocode.  
    - Inputs and outputs have precise specifications: types, formats, range constraints, and behavior are clearly described.  
    - No mention of undefined or partially specified entities or operations, including helper functions and external dependencies.

2. **Deterministic, Clear, and Unambiguous Logic Flow**  
    - All control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion) are completely specified with termination conditions and cover *all* possible cases without gaps, contradictions, or missing branches.  
    - The execution sequence and decision-making are unambiguous, making the state progression precisely reproducible.  
    - No infinite loops lacking exit criteria; no unreachable code segments.

3. **Precise Operations and Expressions**  
    - All calculations, mutations, data manipulations, and side effects are explicitly stated and unambiguous.  
    - Indexing and ordering are clearly defined with zero ambiguity (e.g., zero- vs one-based indexing clearly established).  
    - Operators and expressions are fully specified without vague or informal descriptions.

4. **Self-Contained Context and Environment**  
    - The pseudocode includes all required logic and cannot rely on external or implicit assumptions (environmental state, implicit globals, unstated libraries, datasets, or prior problem knowledge).  
    - No missing essential components that must be externally supplied or inferred.

5. **Robust and Explicit Handling of Edge and Exceptional Cases**  
    - Boundary conditions and special inputs (empty, maximum/minimum values, invalid inputs if relevant) are either explicitly handled or logically guaranteed not to cause undefined/unaddressed behavior.  
    - No unspecified or hidden failure modes or exceptions.  
    - Error-handling, validations, or logical safeguards are part of the pseudocode or logically implied by its structure explicitly.

6. **Logical and Semantic Soundness**  
    - No contradictions, semantic errors or illegal operations (e.g., reading uninitialized variables, modifying immutable structures without explanation).  
    - Algorithmic steps fully align with the intended output and problem goal as described or reasonably inferred from parameter and output definitions.  
    - Data structure manipulations maintain internal consistency; no ambiguous updates, insertions, or removals.

7. **Explicit Control on Iteration and Recursion Termination**  
    - All loops and recursive calls include clear and logical termination criteria.  
    - Progression metrics or invariants that guarantee termination are evident or deducible from the pseudocode.

## Output Instructions:

- If multiple pseudocodes are provided, produce a single string of digits (`1` or `0`), one per pseudocode, **in the order they appear**.  
- Output strictly consists of these digits only — no whitespace, explanations, or extraneous characters.

---

## Additional Notes:

- Treat **any** uncertainty, assumption, or missing detail—even if minor—as grounds for `0`.  
- Do **not** give credit for likely correctness, partial definitions, or plausibility; only fully covered reproducibility earns `1`.  
- Carefully consider representation conventions (indexing bases, tuple definitions, parameter roles) and require that these are unambiguous and consistent.  
- Validate that edge cases and all input variations are either covered or logically impossible to cause issues.  
- The goal is perfect precision—accept no ambiguity or incomplete reasoning paths for `1`.

**Example outputs:**  
`1`  
`0`  
`101` (for three pseudocodes in order)

This formulation explicitly enforces rigorous, binary, and comprehensive reproducibility checks, focusing on zero ambiguity, zero assumptions, and full test coverage guarantees, ensuring the highest possible alignment with passing *all* valid unit tests.
