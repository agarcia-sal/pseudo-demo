Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently evaluate each for **strict full reproducibility** ensuring that it can be faithfully and directly implemented without modification, assumption, or extra interpretation, and will pass **every valid unit test**—including all normal scenarios, boundary conditions, edge cases, and error inputs—without failure.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit per input concatenated in the input order, with no spaces, line breaks, or any additional text:

- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode meets every requirement for exact, unambiguous, and complete implementability that guarantees passing **all** such unit tests.
- Output `0` otherwise, if *any* ambiguity, missing specification, implicit assumption, logical gap, incomplete edge-case coverage, undefined behavior, or external dependency is detected.

### Rigorous Criteria for Deciding Full Reproducibility (ALL must be satisfied):

1. **Comprehensive Explicitness and Definition**  
   - Every variable, parameter, data type, return value, and data structure must be clearly declared or trivially and unambiguously inferable solely from the pseudocode itself.  
   - All inputs and outputs have their formats, types, valid values, and structural constraints precisely defined or derivable without assumptions or external references.  
   - No calls to, references to, or requirements for unspecified external functions, libraries, global states, or environments.

2. **Complete and Deterministic Control Flow and Logic**  
   - All loops, conditionals, and recursion must have precisely described initiation, termination, iteration conditions, and boundaries that preclude infinite loops or undefined halts.  
   - The logic must exhaustively and explicitly cover all possible input domains and branching conditions without gaps, overlaps, or need for implicit interpretation.  
   - No vague instructions like “handle appropriately” without exact algorithmic detail.

3. **Unambiguous, Precise Operations and Conventions**  
   - All operations (arithmetic, indexing, assignments, data mutations) are fully specified with exact semantics; indexing bases and order of evaluation are clearly stated or consistently applied throughout the pseudocode.  
   - No underspecified or ambiguous usage of data mutation sequencing, side effects, or expression evaluation order.

4. **Self-Contained Without Hidden Assumptions or Domain Knowledge**  
   - The solution and its correctness must rely solely on what is presented; no implicit environmental, platform, or domain-specific assumptions allowed.  
   - All assumptions or prerequisites must be explicitly stated or evidently derivable from the pseudocode content alone.

5. **Exhaustive Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Handling**  
   - All conceivable edge cases—including empty input, maximal/minimal values, invalid or malformed inputs (if the domain allows)—must be either explicitly handled or otherwise logically impossible within the problem domain.  
   - No scenario should lead to undefined, silent failure, runtime error, or unexpected behavior.

6. **Logical Consistency and Coherence**  
   - The pseudocode must avoid logical contradictions (e.g., variable use before assignment, incompatible conditions, inconsistent data state transitions).  
   - The steps and data manipulations must clearly progress toward the stated purpose with internally consistent state throughout.

7. **Direct and Complete Implementability**  
   - The entire pseudocode can be translated verbatim into executable code line-by-line without introducing external information, guessing, or filling gaps.  
   - Initial states, loop ranges, indexings, data initializations, and result constructions are fully specified and implementable as-is.

### Output Format:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single uninterrupted string of digits (`1`s or `0`s) reflecting reproducibility of each input in order.  
- Do **not** output any explanations, comments, whitespace, punctuation, partial credits, or additional symbols—only the concatenated digits.  
- Output is strictly a binary string such as `1001`.

---

### Important Internal Judgement Notes (do not include in output):

- Presence of any ambiguity, implicit assumptions, external dependencies, or incomplete edge-handling → output `0`.  
- Any logical gaps, missing definitions, or unclear control flow leading to potential infinite loops, undefined states, or errors → output `0`.  
- Perfect clarity, self-containment, and full coverage → output `1`.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` *only* when the pseudocode is unambiguously complete, explicit, and self-contained, ensuring deterministic success on all relevant unit tests without additional assumptions or interpretation. Otherwise, output `0`.

**Example:**  
Inputs: Three pseudocodes where first and last are fully reproducible, middle one is not → Output: `101`

**Strictly produce only the concatenated string of digits as output.**
