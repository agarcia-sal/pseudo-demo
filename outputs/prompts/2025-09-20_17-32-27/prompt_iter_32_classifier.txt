Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently evaluate each for **full reproducibility**, defined as the ability to implement exactly as provided—without any assumptions, ambiguity, or missing details—and guarantee passing **all** valid unit tests (including normal, boundary, edge, and error cases) under any correct implementation.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit concatenated in order (no spaces, newlines, or formatting):  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode satisfies every aspect of complete, unambiguous, and implementable specification that ensures it will pass all valid unit tests without any external interpretation or supplementation.  
- Output **0** otherwise.

---

### Precise Reproducibility Requirements (all must be unconditionally met):

1. **Complete Explicit Formal Specification**  
   - All variables, parameters, functions, data structures, constants, and return values are fully declared or precisely inferable without guesswork.  
   - Input and output domains, types, formats, and valid ranges are clearly and fully detailed or logically derivable solely from the pseudocode.  
   - No invocation or dependency on any undeclared functions, libraries, global states, or environment-specific constructs.

2. **Fully Deterministic and Exhaustive Control Flow**  
   - Control constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion) state exact bounds, conditions, and termination guarantees without possibility of infinite loops or undefined halts.  
   - All conditional branches and loop iterations account explicitly for every possible input and state, with no omitted or implicit cases.  
   - Algorithmic steps are described concretely without vague phrases (e.g., “handle accordingly”, “some processing”, “error handling implied”)—each operation must be directly actionable as stated.

3. **Precise Data and Operation Semantics**  
   - Data manipulations, indexing, state updates, arithmetic, and side effects are defined explicitly with conventional, consistent conventions (such as zero- or one-based indexing clearly stated or consistently applied).  
   - Evaluation order, side effects, and data mutations are unambiguous and reproducible on any standard platform or language.  
   - No underspecified behaviors, implicit coercions, or reference to unstable constructs.

4. **Self-Contained Context**  
   - The pseudocode fully encompasses every necessary detail, requiring no external domain knowledge, platform-specific assumptions, or environmental dependencies beyond what is present in the pseudocode itself.  
   - All assumptions made are explicitly declared; if any assumption cannot be directly verified within the pseudocode text, reproducibility is failed.

5. **Comprehensive Edge, Boundary, and Error Case Handling**  
   - Edge cases (empty or minimal inputs, maximal values, malformed inputs within the declared domain) are explicitly handled or logically impossible by the specification.  
   - No input within the declared domain can cause undefined, unspecified, silent failure, or runtime error behavior.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Coherence**  
   - There are no contradictions (e.g., using variables before initialization, mutually exclusive conditions assumed simultaneously true, or inconsistent data states).  
   - The algorithmic flow logically leads to the declared outputs without gaps or loose ends.

7. **Direct Operational Implementability**  
   - The provided pseudocode can be translated line-for-line to an executable, functioning program in any standard programming language without guesswork, missing details, or supplementation.  
   - All variables are initialized before use, indices and bounds are explicit, and all loops, recursion, and state transitions are fully specified.

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a contiguous string of digits only, no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or any other text.  
- Each digit corresponds exactly to the reproducibility result of the respective input, sequenced in the same order.  
- Output only the digit string—no explanations, partial credits, or commentary.

---

### Important Adjudication Guidance (internal use only, do not output):

- Any need to interpret, guess, assume, or supplement the pseudocode leads to `0`.  
- Any ambiguous or incomplete handling of inputs, control flow, data operations, or edge cases leads to `0`.  
- Dependency on external or platform-specific knowledge beyond the pseudocode causes `0`.  
- Any logical inconsistency or potential for undefined/erroneous behavior causes `0`.  
- Perfect, explicit, fully comprehensive, and logically sound pseudocode implementations receive `1`.

---

### Summary

Output `1` for each pseudocode input that can be implemented verbatim, reliably and unambiguously, to pass *all* valid unit tests without any additional assumptions or information. Output `0` otherwise. Return only the concatenated string of these digits in the order the pseudocodes were given.

---

**Examples:**  
- One perfectly detailed pseudocode → output: `1`  
- One incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where the first and last are reproducible, and the middle is not → output: `101`

**Strictly no text or characters outside the reproducibility digit string are allowed in the output.**
