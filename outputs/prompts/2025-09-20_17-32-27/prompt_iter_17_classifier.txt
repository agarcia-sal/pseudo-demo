Analyze each provided pseudocode snippet independently and determine if it is fully **reproducible**, meaning that a programmer can implement it as-is into a correct, fully functioning program that will pass **all conceivable valid unit tests** (including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases) without needing any external assumptions, clarifications, or additions.

For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one digit:

- `1` if the pseudocode is **completely reproducible** by the criteria below,  
- `0` otherwise.

Do not output spaces, commas, line breaks, explanations, partial scores, or any other text—only output the concatenated string of digits corresponding to the sequence of pseudocodes provided.

### Criteria for Complete Reproducibility (All must be met without exception):

1. **Explicit and Exhaustive Definitions**  
   - All elements used (variables, data structures, functions, parameters, constants) must be fully introduced, clearly defined, or unambiguously deducible without guesswork.  
   - Input and output formats, types, structure, and return values are explicitly stated or logically specified with no ambiguity.  
   - No references to undefined helpers, external libraries, hidden global states, or implicit environment assumptions.

2. **Precise, Complete, and Unambiguous Control Flow**  
   - Every control structure (loops, conditions, recursion) must have clear and exact conditions for entry, exit, and iteration/progression.  
   - Branches and cases cover the entire logical domain exhaustively, leaving no implicit or unexplained gaps.  
   - No ambiguous instructions, placeholders, or vague directives (e.g., “handle accordingly”, “etc.”).

3. **Deterministic, Well-Specified Operations**  
   - All computations and data manipulations are precisely described with unambiguous semantics: indexing conventions, data access, variable updates, and side effects.  
   - No reliance on unspecified or subjective interpretations of operations.  
   - Numeric, string, and structural operations must be concrete and replicable exactly.

4. **Self-Containment and Context Independence**  
   - The pseudocode does not depend on unstated assumptions, implicit prior knowledge, or external context outside the snippet provided.  
   - No need for domain expertise or platform-specific details beyond what is explicitly included.  
   - The snippet should be implementable standalone without additional explanatory information.

5. **Complete Edge Case and Error Handling Coverage**  
   - All relevant edge and boundary cases (empty inputs, minimal values, maximal values, malformed inputs) are either explicitly handled or impossibilities proven by the pseudocode logic.  
   - No scenario leads to undefined behavior, runtime errors, infinite loops, or silent failures.  
   - Error and exceptional states are fully accounted for or logically excluded.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Integrity**  
   - No contradictions exist (e.g., variable used before assignment, unreachable code, conflicting conditions).  
   - The logic flow aligns coherently with the stated objectives and guarantees correctness.  
   - Data structures remain consistent across operations; no ambiguous concurrent or conflicting modifications.

7. **Direct Implementability Without Inference or Supplementation**  
   - The pseudocode is ready for direct translation into a concrete programming language line-by-line or stepwise with no interpretative gap.  
   - Initialization, indexing ranges, loop bounds, termination criteria, and output constructions are fully and explicitly specified.  
   - No steps require guesswork, guessable names, or assumed standard idioms.

---

### Output Format Reminder:

- For multiple pseudocodes given sequentially, produce a continuous string of `0`s and `1`s.  
- The nth digit corresponds exactly to the nth pseudocode snippet.  
- No other characters or whitespace allowed.

---

**Scoring Guideline:**  
If any assumption, ambiguity, reliance on external context, missing detail, infinite/ambiguous loop, incomplete edge case, vague phrase, undefined term or operation appears, output `0` for that pseudocode. Only fully explicit, logically sound, and context-free pseudocode with guaranteed pass of all valid unit tests earns `1`.

---

**Summary:**  
Your final task is a strict binary decision:

- `1` = pseudocode is fully sufficient for flawless implementation and testing without assumptions,   
- `0` = otherwise.

No exceptions or partial credit.

---

**Example outcomes:**  
- Single fully specified, comprehensive pseudocode → `1`  
- Single incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → `0`  
- Three pseudocodes where the first and third meet all criteria, the second does not → `101`
