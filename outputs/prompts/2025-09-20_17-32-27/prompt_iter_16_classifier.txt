Given one or more pseudocode inputs, your task is to determine for each whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be directly and unambiguously implemented to pass **every valid unit test**, including normal, edge, boundary, and exceptional cases, with no assumptions, inferences, or missing information.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit:  
- **1** if and only if the pseudocode is entirely self-sufficient, explicit, logically complete, and guarantees correctness and termination for all valid inputs,  
- **0** otherwise.

### Essential Criteria for Full Reproducibility (all must be met):

1. **Explicit Definitions and Declarations**  
   - Every variable, parameter, constant, function, and data structure used is clearly declared or derivable without guesswork.  
   - Input and output types, formats, and constraints are explicitly specified or logically deducible.  
   - No invocation of undefined routines, implicit globals, external dependencies, or hidden state without full description.

2. **Complete, Precise, and Unambiguous Logic**  
   - Control flow structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) include exact entry, proceeding, and termination conditions, preventing infinite or undefined loops.  
   - Decision branches comprehensively cover all possible cases with no logical gaps or contradictions; no reliance on implicit default behavior.  
   - Each instruction or operation precisely contributes to the algorithm’s stated purpose, avoiding vague or incomplete steps.

3. **Deterministic Concrete Operations**  
   - All data manipulations, indexing, updates, and state changes are fully elaborated with unambiguous semantics and consistent conventions.  
   - Operations use standard, clearly defined logic that can be implemented without any external interpretation.  
   - Prohibits vague phrases (e.g., “handle accordingly,” “process rest”) without explicit algorithmic detail.

4. **Self-Contained with No External Assumptions**  
   - Correctness does not depend on external context, platform-specific features, environmental conditions, or any hidden assumptions beyond what is included with the pseudocode.  
   - No invocation or implication of unprovided libraries, language-specific behaviors, or side effects outside the described domain.

5. **Exhaustive Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - All relevant input scenarios, including empty, minimal, maximal, malformed, or exceptional inputs, are either explicitly handled or demonstrably impossible by the code structure.  
   - The pseudocode precludes undefined or silent failure behaviors for any valid input as specified.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Correctness**  
   - No contradictions such as use-before-assignment, mutually exclusive conditions simultaneously true, or inconsistent states.  
   - The sequence of operations and data updates aligns with the stated goals, ensuring the correctness of the final output.

7. **Ready for Direct Line-by-Line Implementation**  
   - The pseudocode specifies all initializations, ranges, update steps, and termination criteria fully, enabling direct translation into functioning code without supplementation or inference.  
   - Indexing conventions, loop bounds, and data structure details must be precise and unambiguous.

### Instructions for Output:

- When given multiple pseudocode inputs sequentially, output a single continuous string of digits, each digit corresponding to the reproducibility of the respective pseudocode in input order.  
- Each digit must be:  
  - `1` if the respective pseudocode is fully reproducible by the above definition,  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- Output strictly **only** this string of digits — no spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other characters.

---

### Additional Guidance (Do NOT output these, internal use only):

- Any reliance on implied knowledge, assumptions, or best-guess interpretations invalidates reproducibility (score 0).  
- Infinite loops, ambiguous termination, or omission of edge case handling mandates rejection.  
- Pseudocode that is “almost correct” but omits crucial details or handles edge cases unclearly must be scored as `0`.  
- Assess each pseudocode independently and impartially, regardless of style or complexity differences.  
- The decision is strictly binary; partial credit or scores other than `0` or `1` are not allowed.

---

### Summary

Only return `1` for pseudocode that is exhaustively complete, explicit, logically sound, and completely sufficient to implement a correct, fully tested program. Any ambiguity, incompleteness, or unstated assumption must result in `0`.

---

**Examples:**  
- Input: One flawless pseudocode → Output: `1`  
- Input: One incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → Output: `0`  
- Input: Three pseudocodes (first and third reproducible, second not) → Output: `101`

**Strictly output only the binary reproducibility string.**
