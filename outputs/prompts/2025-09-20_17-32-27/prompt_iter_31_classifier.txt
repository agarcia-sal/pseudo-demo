Given one or more pseudocode inputs, evaluate each separately to determine if it is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be implemented exactly as provided, without any ambiguity, omission, or hidden assumptions, and will pass every valid unit test, including normal, edge, boundary, and error cases, without fail.

For each pseudocode input, output a single digit per pseudocode, concatenated in order with no spaces or extra characters:  
- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** criteria below and can be translated directly into working code that passes all tests exactly;  
- Output `0` otherwise.

### Definitive Criteria for Reproducibility (all must be strictly met):

1. **Explicit and Exhaustive Specification**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, structures, functions, their types, valid domains, and return values are fully and clearly declared or precisely inferable *solely* from the pseudocode itself, without guessing.  
   - No reference to undeclared external helpers, libraries, global states, or platform-specific behaviors.  
   - Data formats, indexing conventions, and value constraints (including zero vs one-based indexing) are clearly stated or intrinsically unambiguous.

2. **Complete, Unambiguous Logic and Control Flow**  
   - Control constructs (loops, recursion, conditionals) detail initializations, bounds, termination conditions, and cover all possible input cases explicitly.  
   - Branching is fully comprehensive, no implicit “else” or catch-all without clear logic.  
   - All steps are precisely described algorithmically; no placeholders, vague instructions, or "handle appropriately" without concrete directions.

3. **Deterministic, Precisely Defined Operations**  
   - Every data manipulation, indexing, mutation, arithmetic operation, and side effect is clearly and consistently defined, with unambiguous evaluation order and no undefined behavior.  
   - Indexing style is consistent and declared or obviously uniform throughout all code.

4. **Self-Contained Without External Assumptions**  
   - The pseudocode stands fully alone — no assumptions on environment, platform, timing, memory model, or hidden domain knowledge are allowed.  
   - Any dependency or requirement must be explicitly stated within the pseudocode.

5. **Full Handling of All Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - All boundary inputs, empty or maximal inputs, invalid conditions (if applicable), and potential error cases must be explicitly handled or proven impossible by the pseudocode logic.  
   - No silent failures, undefined states, or infinite loops remain.

6. **Logical and Semantic Consistency**  
   - No contradictions exist (e.g., use-before-initialization, conflicting conditions, inconsistent state updates).  
   - The flow and data states are coherent, progressing logically to the final stated goal.

7. **Direct Implementation Readiness**  
   - The pseudocode can be converted line-by-line into actual code without needing to fill gaps, interpret ambiguities, or add any unstated details.  
   - All loop indices, data structure updates, function invocations, and result constructions are fully and explicitly described.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For multiple pseudocode inputs, output a single string of digits, without spaces, line breaks, or any other characters.  
- Each digit corresponds to the reproducibility of the respective pseudocode input, in order.  
- Only output the string of `1`s and `0`s; nothing else.

---

### Additional Internal Notes (do not output):

- Assume any form of assumption, guesswork, or supplementation is a reason to output `0`.  
- Ambiguities or missing explicit details that could cause failure or uncertainty produce `0`.  
- Dependence on platform behavior, language-specific features, or external factors causes `0`.  
- Logical incompleteness such as potential infinite loops or unhandled branches results in `0`.

---

### Summary:

Output `1` strictly when the pseudocode is **fully explicit, complete, logically consistent, and ready for direct translation that guarantees passing all valid unit tests without any external assumptions or clarifications**.

Output `0` otherwise.

---

### Example:

- Single clearly reproducible pseudocode → output: `1`  
- One incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode → output: `0`  
- Multiple pseudocodes, reproducible first and third, second not → output: `101`

**Strictly do not output anything other than the concatenated string of digits.**
