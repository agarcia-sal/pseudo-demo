Given one or more pseudocode inputs, determine for each whether it is **completely reproducible** — meaning it can be implemented **exactly as given** and will pass **all valid unit tests** (including edge, boundary, and exceptional cases) with **no ambiguity, assumption, or missing detail**.

---

### For each pseudocode, output only **1** if and only if **all** the following rigorous conditions hold; otherwise output **0**:

---

#### 1. **Full explicitness and definitional completeness**  
- All variables, data structures, functions, procedures, constants, and types are fully defined or unambiguously derivable within the pseudocode.  
- Input and output are clearly specified, including data types, formats, side-effects, and expected results.  
- No reference exists to any undefined, partially defined, or externally assumed concepts, functions, or data.  
- Initialization details and all parameter roles are unambiguously stated.

#### 2. **Precise, unambiguous control and data flow**  
- Every control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion) is completely specified, with explicit loop boundaries, termination criteria, and clearly defined iteration progression.  
- Branching logic covers every logical possibility without gaps or contradictions.  
- No infinite loops or unreachable code segments without documented termination or explicit break conditions.  
- The narrative of execution flow defines one clear, unambiguous path(s) per input.

#### 3. **Deterministic operations, exact expressions, and state updates**  
- All computational steps, updates to variables and data structures, and side effects are precisely described—operator semantics, indexing, data mutations, and ordering are explicit and consistent.  
- No vague, partial, or context-dependent operations remain. Any ambiguous or probabilistic constructs are disallowed.  
- Data accesses and manipulations use clearly stated, valid indices/keys.

#### 4. **Self-contained context with no external dependencies or assumptions**  
- The pseudocode requires no external environment, data, library, or hidden knowledge beyond what is explicitly given.  
- No assumptions about implicit global states, runtime environment, or platform-specific behavior.

#### 5. **Comprehensive edge case, boundary condition, and error scenario handling**  
- Exceptional inputs (e.g., empty, minimal, maximal, null) and boundary conditions are either explicitly handled or logically guaranteed by code structure.  
- No paths induce undefined or unspecified behavior under any valid input scenario.

#### 6. **Logical soundness and semantic consistency**  
- No contradictions or semantic conflicts exist (e.g., variable use before assignment, conflicting conditions).  
- The decomposition into functions and data operations coherently reflects a logically correct algorithm aligned with the stated problem purpose.  
- Data structure manipulations are consistent and do not create ambiguous or contradictory states.

#### 7. **Clarity that allows deterministic and straightforward implementation**  
- The pseudocode is sufficiently clear and detailed to translate directly into a working implementation without requiring guesswork, domain-specific interpretation, or external context.  
- Loop invariants, initialization, and termination conditions are evident or deducible without inference.

### Output instructions:  
- For multiple pseudocodes input sequentially, output a single concatenated string of digits, one digit per pseudocode, in the input order.  
- For each pseudocode, output:  
  - `1` if it strictly meets **all** criteria above (fully reproducible),  
  - Otherwise, `0`.  
- Output **only** the concatenated digits. No spaces, newlines, explanations, or any other characters.  
- Make a strict binary decision — any ambiguity or missing detail, even if minor or likely correctable, means output `0`.  
- Do not rely on any external knowledge beyond the pseudocode itself.

---

**Examples:**  
Input 1 pseudocode → output: `1`  
Input 3 pseudocodes → output: `010`  
Input 5 pseudocodes → output: `11100`

---

**Key evaluation guidance (implicit; no output needed):**  
- Prioritize exactness and unambiguity over style or syntax fidelity.  
- Identify implicit assumptions, hidden dependencies, or omitted edge cases as disqualifying.  
- Verify completeness of all algorithmic steps, including initialization, data manipulation, and termination guarantees.  
- Reject any incomplete specification, implied behavior, or partial correctness claim.

This prompt enforces a more stringent, multi-dimensional criterion for reproducibility by emphasizing total definitional completeness, logic rigor, unambiguous flow, deterministic operations, and full edge case coverage — ensuring that only pseudocode which can be implemented exactly as is and guaranteed to pass all unit tests receives a `1`.
