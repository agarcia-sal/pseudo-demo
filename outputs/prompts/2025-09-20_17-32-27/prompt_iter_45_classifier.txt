Given one or more pseudocode inputs, independently analyze each pseudocode for **complete reproducibility** defined strictly as:  
it can be implemented exactly as provided, with zero ambiguity or missing detail, without any external assumptions or interpretation, and will pass every valid unit test—covering typical, boundary, edge, and error conditions—without failure.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one character (no spaces, punctuation, or newlines), concatenated in order:

- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode satisfies *all* of the following stringent, interdependent criteria, making it guaranteed to be implementable and correct:  
- Output **0** otherwise (if any ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumption, missing edge case handling, or unspecified behavior exists).

### Definitive Criteria for Perfect Reproducibility (must be all met):

1. **Complete Declarations and Definitions**  
   - Every variable, parameter, data structure, constant, function, and return value is explicitly declared or can be unambiguously inferred *solely* from the pseudocode.  
   - Input and output types, structures, formats, and valid value domains are fully specified or derivable without guesswork.  
   - No reliance on any external routines, libraries, global states, or side-information outside this pseudocode.

2. **Exhaustive and Unambiguous Control and Logic**  
   - All control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion) define precise start/end conditions, indexing, and termination guarantees—no infinite or undefined iterations possible.  
   - All conditional branches and cases cover every logically possible input or state, with no gaps or fallback "handles" left vague or implicit.  
   - Algorithmic operations are described concretely without placeholders, high-level abstractions, or underspecified instructions.

3. **Deterministic, Well-Defined Operations and Semantics**  
   - Every data manipulation, arithmetic or logical operation, state mutation, and side-effect is fully specified with clear, consistent semantics (e.g., zero- vs. one-based indices stated or clearly inferable and strictly maintained).  
   - No ambiguous evaluation orders or parallel/mutating steps that require external knowledge or assumptions to resolve.

4. **Self-Contained, Context-Independent Solution**  
   - The pseudocode is stand-alone: it does not depend on platform-specific behavior, domain knowledge, environment settings, or implicit assumptions beyond the stated inputs and outputs.  
   - All dependencies or assumptions are clearly declared within the given text.

5. **Complete Handling of All Edge, Boundary, and Error Cases**  
   - Input extremes (empty inputs, singleton values, maximum constraints), invalid or malformed inputs where applicable, and other corner cases are explicitly handled or logically impossible given the code's constraints.  
   - No input or state can cause undefined or erroneous behavior, exceptions, or silent failures.

6. **Logical Consistency and Semantic Coherence**  
   - No contradictions anywhere (e.g., use-before-assign, conflicting conditional logic, inconsistent data structures).  
   - Internal states and variable transformations track and maintain coherence explicitly, with no ambiguous or conflicting updates.

7. **Ready-to-Implement, Line-by-Line Executable**  
   - The pseudocode is immediately translatable into a concrete programming language without any need for guesswork, supplementation, or external detail beyond what is provided.  
   - Index ranges, initializations, iterations, data constructions, and return values are all fully detailed and explicit.

### Output Instructions

- For multiple inputs, output a single string of digits with no spaces or symbols.  
- Each digit corresponds exactly to the reproducibility judgment for the respective pseudocode input.  
- Only output the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s. No explanations, comments, or partial scores.

---

### Internal Evaluation Notes (do not include in output)  

- Any missing explicit detail, requirement to infer or assume, omitted edge handling, or reliance on external context mandates output `0`.  
- Any ambiguous or contradictory instructions mandate output `0`.  
- Pseudocode must be judged entirely independently.

---

**Summary:**  
Output `1` only for pseudocode inputs that are fully explicit, self-contained, complete, unambiguous, logically coherent, and immediately implementable to pass **all** unit tests without external assumptions or guesswork. Otherwise, output `0`.  

---

**Example outputs:**  
- One fully reproducible pseudocode: output `1`  
- One incomplete or ambiguous pseudocode: output `0`  
- For three pseudocodes where first and third are reproducible, second is not: output `101`

**Strictly output nothing other than the concatenation of reproducibility digits.**
