Given one or more pseudocode inputs, for each determine if it is fully **reproducible**—meaning it can be implemented exactly as written and will pass **all valid unit tests** (including normal, edge, boundary, and exceptional cases) **without any assumptions, guesswork, or external knowledge**.

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit:  
- `1` if and only if the pseudocode is perfectly complete, explicit, unambiguous, and directly implementable so as to guarantee correctness and reproducibility in all cases,  
- `0` otherwise.

### Strict Criteria for Reproducibility (Every condition must be met):

1. **Explicit Definitions and Scope**  
   - All variables, parameters, data structures, functions, constants, and inputs/outputs are clearly defined or unambiguously derivable from the pseudocode itself.  
   - Input and output formats, types, and expectations are conveyed explicitly or so precisely that no external interpretation is necessary.  
   - No references to any undefined functions, libraries, global variables, or external states outside the pseudocode.

2. **Complete and Precise Logic**  
   - Every control structure (loops, conditionals, recursion) is fully described with deterministic entry, exit, and termination conditions—no ambiguous or potentially infinite loops.  
   - All logical branches cover the entire input domain exhaustively, leaving no scenario unaddressed or ambiguous.  
   - Instructions and steps must be concrete and unambiguous; vague or generic phrases (“handle accordingly,” “process this,” etc.) render the pseudocode non-reproducible.

3. **Deterministic and Unambiguous Operations**  
   - Every operation, state change, indexing, and data manipulation is precisely specified with standard, consistent conventions (e.g., 0- or 1-based indexing clearly implied, inclusive/exclusive ranges stated).  
   - No implicit assumptions about language-specific behavior, execution order, or side effects.  
   - Expressions and computations must be evaluable exactly as given.

4. **Total Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The pseudocode requires no outside context, prior knowledge, or environment-specific assumptions—everything needed to fully implement and execute it is provided within the pseudocode.  
   - No reliance on implicit domain knowledge, platform-specific details, or unstated libraries.

5. **Explicit Edge Case and Error Handling**  
   - All boundary conditions, minimal inputs, empty inputs, malformed inputs, and exceptional scenarios are clearly handled or provably impossible within the pseudocode’s framework.  
   - No operations can result in undefined behavior, exceptions, or silent failures on any valid input.

6. **Semantic Consistency and Logical Coherence**  
   - No contradictions or conflicts in definitions, variable usage before assignment, or mutually exclusive conditions assumed simultaneously.  
   - The algorithm’s steps consistently and coherently lead to the intended goal, data structures remain valid and consistent after each modification.  
   - No ambiguities in concurrent or sequential data/state changes.

7. **Direct Readiness for Implementation**  
   - The pseudocode is implementable line-by-line or stepwise in a standard programming language without requiring further interpretation or filling in omitted details.  
   - All loops, index ranges, initializations, and output constructions are fully elaborated and deterministic.

### Output Instructions

- When multiple pseudocode inputs are given consecutively, output a single uninterrupted string of digits (no spaces, newlines, or other characters).  
- The nth digit corresponds to the reproducibility of the nth pseudocode input.  
- Output only digits `1` or `0`—no explanations, partial credits, or additional text.

---

### Important Notes (For internal use; do not include in output)

- Any need for inference, assumption, or external knowledge results in a `0`.  
- Incomplete edge case coverage or ambiguous handling leads to `0`.  
- Infinite loops or unclear termination conditions result in `0`.  
- Ambiguities around indexing, data structure formats, or return values lead to `0`.  
- Multiple pseudocodes are evaluated independently and separately.

---

**Summary:**  
Score `1` only if the pseudocode can be executed without any additional specification, assumptions, or interpretation, and will pass all conceivable unit tests regardless of input scenario. Otherwise, output `0`.

---

**Example:**  
Input: one reproducible pseudocode → Output: `1`  
Input: one ambiguous/incomplete pseudocode → Output: `0`  
Input: three pseudocodes, first and third reproducible but second not → Output: `101`

Strict binary output only: a string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to each pseudocode in input order, nothing else.
