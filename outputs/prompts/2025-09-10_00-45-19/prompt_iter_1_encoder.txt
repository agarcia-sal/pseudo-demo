Write pseudocode for the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using concise, high-level, natural language with one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where suitable. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
