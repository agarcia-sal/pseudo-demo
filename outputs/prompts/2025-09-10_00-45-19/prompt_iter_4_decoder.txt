Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured Python code, preserving the exact function names and signatures implied or explicitly stated in the pseudocode. Your implementation should be correct, efficient (aim to run within 5 seconds), and idiomatic Python. Use any standard Python libraries if they help optimize or clarify the code. 

Enclose your entire answer in a single Python code block as follows:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Make sure:
- The code can be directly run without dependencies on any undefined classes or wrappers (e.g., do NOT wrap code inside undefined classes like `Solution`).
- Variable names and logic follow the pseudocode closely.
- Edge cases and input checks appearing in the pseudocode are implemented appropriately.
- Formatting and indentation follow Python best practices for readability and correctness.
- No extraneous output or comments unrelated to code are included.

This approach ensures your final code is self-contained, accurate, and ready for immediate testing.
