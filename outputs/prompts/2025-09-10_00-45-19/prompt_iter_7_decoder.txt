Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code. Your translation must:

- Preserve **all function names and signatures exactly as implied or explicitly stated** in the pseudocode.
- Implement all logic, variable names, and control flow so they closely follow the pseudocode.
- Include **all necessary input checks and handle edge cases** as indicated or logically required.
- Produce **self-contained code that can be run directly**â€”do **not** wrap code in any undefined classes (e.g., no `Solution` class) or rely on external wrappers.
- Use appropriate and standard Python libraries and language features to keep the code concise, clear, and performant (aim to run within 5 seconds).
- Ensure formatting and indentation comply with Python best practices, maximizing readability and correctness.
- Return your answer as a **single, complete Python code block** exactly like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```

- Do **not** include any explanations, comments unrelated to code, imports unused by your code, or additional text outside the code block.

Your goal is to deliver a fully-functional, readable, and optimized Python implementation faithful to the original pseudocode and ready for immediate testing.
