Write concise, compact pseudocode directly corresponding to the given problem’s function, preserving its exact name.  
Use natural, high-level language that is easy to read and logically clear, favoring short one-liners, symbolic operators (←, =, ≠, ≤, ∧, ∨), and common abbreviations.  
Do not include any explanations, comments, purpose statements, or summaries—output only the pseudocode.  
Format your output as numbered lines starting from 1, following this style exactly:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid any separator lines, extra indentation beyond natural code blocks, or nonstandard formatting.  
Keep all logic self-contained and the pseudocode minimal yet expressive enough for direct implementation.  
The output must be only the numbered pseudocode lines, starting with the function declaration line like:  

1. def functionName(params):  
...  

Example:  

1. def main():  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be array of integers size n  
5. read all elements into A  
6. for i in 0 to n-2:  
7.  min_i ← i  
8.  for j in i+1 to n-1: if A[j] < A[min_i]: min_i ← j  
9.  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
10. print all elements in A
