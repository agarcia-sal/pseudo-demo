Write concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description, preserving the original function name exactly. Use clear natural language while remaining compact and easy to understand. Favor one-liners, symbolic operators, and common abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include any purpose statements, explanatory notes, comments, or summaries—output only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format precisely with numbered lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid any separator lines or extra formatting. Ensure the pseudocode is readable but minimal, using natural expressions that make the logic clear and self-contained. The output should be just the code, suitable for direct implementation reference.
