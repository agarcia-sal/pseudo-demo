Write concise, compact, and high-level pseudocode for the given problem description, preserving the exact original function name. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language with symbolic operators and common abbreviations where appropriate. Favor one-line statements when possible. Do not include any explanatory notes, comments, summaries, or purpose statements—output only the pseudocode lines. Number every line starting from 1. Do not add any separator lines or extra formatting. The format must follow this example exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use minimal but clear natural expressions that allow the logic to be self-contained and suitable as a direct implementation reference. Keep the overall output compact, focusing on clarity and brevity while maintaining correctness.
