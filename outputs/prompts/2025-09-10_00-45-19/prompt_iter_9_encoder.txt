Write concise, high-level pseudocode for the given problem description that preserves the original function name exactly. The pseudocode should be easy to read, natural, and compact, using more natural language while remaining precise and self-contained. Use symbolic operators and common abbreviations where suitable. Favor one-line statements when appropriate. Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or purpose statements—output only the pseudocode itself.

Present the pseudocode as a numbered list starting at 1, following this exact style format:

1. function <OriginalFunctionName>(parameters)  
2.   initialize variables with natural expressions  
3.   for each element in collection: operation  
4.   if condition: action  
5.   while condition: single-line or indented statements  
6.   return result

Avoid any extra formatting, separator lines, or notes. Ensure indentation and line breaks clearly represent logic blocks but keep it minimal and succinct. The output must be pseudocode only, ready for direct implementation reference.
