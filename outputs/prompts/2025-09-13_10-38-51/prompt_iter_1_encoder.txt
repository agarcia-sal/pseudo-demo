Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Do not include purpose, summary, overview, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Make it easy to read and understand using natural language, compact statements, one-liners, symbolic notation, and abbreviations where possible. Prefer a step-by-step numbered format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

The pseudocode should focus solely on the logic and flow without comments or explanations. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to produce the best possible concise pseudocode within that limit.
