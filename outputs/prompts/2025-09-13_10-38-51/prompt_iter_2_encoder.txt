Generate concise, high-level pseudocode directly from the problem description. Include only the pseudocode itself—no purpose, summary, explanations, or notes. Use natural language with clear, compact, and readable statements combining symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Preserve the original class and function names exactly as given, and maintain the same class/object structure.

Prefer step-by-step numbered lines formatted like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use one-liners where possible to enhance brevity without losing clarity. Avoid verbose phrases or redundant elements. Do not use separator lines or extra formatting. Focus solely on the logic and flow.

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
