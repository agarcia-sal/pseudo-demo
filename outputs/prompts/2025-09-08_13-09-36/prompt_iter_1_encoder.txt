Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Do not include any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not add comments or explanatory notes. Use clear, natural language phrasing while keeping the pseudocode easy to read and understand. Favor one-liners, symbolic operations, and common abbreviations. Follow a numbered list format like this:  
1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
The pseudocode should be compact and direct, avoiding detailed low-level code. Your function has a 5-second timeout; prioritize producing the best possible output within this limit.
