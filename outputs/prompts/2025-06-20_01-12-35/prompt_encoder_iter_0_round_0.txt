Translate the given code into concise, easy-to-read pseudocode using natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, notes, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Keep it compact and high-level, favoring one-liners and minimal detail even if some important info is omitted to reduce line count. Format steps as numbered lines with clear assignments and control structures. For example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3. if A[i] > A[j]: swap A[i], A[j]

Your output should follow this style exactly and complete within 5 seconds.
