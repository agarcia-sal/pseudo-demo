Generate concise, clear pseudocode from the provided problem description and code. The pseudocode must:

- Be easy to read and understand, using natural language but compact, high-level statements.
- Use the exact original function name and variable names where applicable.
- Prefer one-line statements, symbolic operations, and standard abbreviations.
- Avoid purpose, summary, comments, explanations, or notes—output only the pseudocode itself.
- Follow this exact numbered format, with each step on its own line:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

- Use natural control structures (if, for, while, define, return) with minimal verbosity.
- Avoid separator lines or extra formatting, producing clean and tightly packed pseudocode.
- Prioritize clarity and brevity, balancing enough detail to capture logic without redundancy.
- Assume a 5-second runtime limit; output the best compact pseudocode within this constraint.
