Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, syntactically correct, and idiomatic Python code. Adhere strictly to the following requirements:

- Preserve all class names, method/function names, and their input/output structure exactly as specified in the pseudocode.
- Maintain the class and method organization as shown.
- Ensure the final code runs correctly without errors or exceptions.
- Implement robust input handling consistent with typical Python usage, converting obvious data structures like lists or primitives naturally.
- Use Python standard libraries or well-known packages only if they clearly improve readability or efficiency; otherwise prefer clear, explicit implementations.
- Optimize your code for correctness, clarity, efficiency, and readabilityâ€”assume a 5-second execution time limit.
- Enclose the entire output strictly within a single Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

- Do not include any explanations, comments outside the code block, or any extra text unless explicitly asked. Only output the Python code block with the translated code.
