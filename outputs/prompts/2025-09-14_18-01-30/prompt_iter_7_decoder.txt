Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, syntactically correct, and idiomatic Python implementation with these explicit and enhanced requirements:

- Strictly preserve all class names, method/function names, and their input/output signatures exactly as shown in the pseudocode.
- Maintain the exact class and method structure, including nesting and indentation.
- Accurately interpret and convert all pseudocode control flow, assignments, and expressions into equivalent Python constructs.
- For inputs that represent complex data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees), convert incoming parameters from common Python types (such as lists or primitives) into the appropriate data structure instances as needed, so the method can operate correctly on expected object types.
- Include appropriate and minimal helper classes or functions if implied by the pseudocode context (for example, ListNode classes for linked lists) so that the final code runs successfully without external dependencies beyond standard libraries.
- Implement thorough and idiomatic input validation and handling consistent with usual Python practices.
- Optimize comprehensibility, correctness, and efficiency while adhering to a 5-second runtime constraint.
- You may leverage any well-known, stable Python library or built-in modules if they clearly improve code clarity or performance.
- Do not produce any explanation, comments outside the code block, or any text beyond the requested code.
- Your output must be only one Python code block with no trailing or leading content, formatted exactly as:

```python
# translated code here
```

Follow these guidelines carefully to ensure that your translation produces precise and runnable Python code consistent with the given pseudocode.
