Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a high-level style with natural language, symbolic representations, abbreviations, and mostly one-liners. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—only pseudocode. Follow a numbered format for each line, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your pseudocode should reflect the logic directly and be understandable without additional notes. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible output within this limit.
