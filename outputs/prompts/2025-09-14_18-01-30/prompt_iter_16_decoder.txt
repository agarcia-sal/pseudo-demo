Translate the provided pseudocode into a valid, idiomatic, and efficient Python implementation adhering strictly to these enhanced guidelines:

- Exactly preserve all class names, function/method names, and signatures—including casing, parameters, and their order—as shown in the pseudocode.
- Maintain the exact class and method nesting and indentation hierarchy as described.
- Precisely convert all control structures, expressions, comparisons, assignments, and operations to their Python equivalents without altering semantics (e.g., integer division with //, equality with ==, logical AND with `and`).
- Automatically define minimal, well-structured helper classes (e.g., ListNode, TreeNode) when pseudocode input parameters represent linked lists, trees, or similar data structures. Provide robust static or class methods to convert standard Python inputs (lists, tuples, primitives) into these structures, handling all edge cases gracefully.
- Embed idiomatic, concise input validation aligned with LeetCode-style constraints (e.g., confirming types and non-empty inputs when appropriate) but avoid redundant or excessive checks that reduce clarity or performance.
- Optimize variable names and code flow for clarity and readability without compromising fidelity to the pseudocode.
- Utilize Python standard libraries or common, lightweight packages only when they clearly improve clarity, correctness, or efficiency, and never introduce unnecessary complexity or dependencies.
- Ensure the entire output is a single Python code block (enclosed in triple backticks and the language specifier `python`) with no additional text, comments outside the code block, example calls, main guards, or print statements.
- The produced code must be immediately runnable and self-contained, relying only on Python’s standard library.
- Pay strict attention to matching the return types, formats, and output details specified in the pseudocode.
- Ensure all helper code is appropriately nested or scoped per the pseudocode’s class structure for encapsulation.
- Implement minimal but effective runtime protections to help meet a 5-second execution constraint.
- Aim for maximal correctness and test passing by preserving every semantic detail and edge case implied or explicit in the pseudocode.
