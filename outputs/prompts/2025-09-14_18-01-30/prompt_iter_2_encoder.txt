Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and directly reflects the logic. Preserve all class names, function names, and their structure exactly as in the problem. Use mostly one-liners, natural language combined with symbolic notations and standard abbreviations, keeping the pseudocode compact yet clear. Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or purpose statements—output only the pseudocode. Use the following numbered line format without any separator lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Favor clarity through meaningful variable names over excessive abbreviation, but keep lines short and focused. Represent control flow and data operations naturally and succinctly. The pseudocode should be immediately understandable and implementable by an experienced programmer without additional notes. Your output must complete within 5 seconds.

Example:

If the problem function is:

def calc_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    avg = total / len(nums)
    return avg

Then output:

1. FUNCTION calc_average(nums)  
2.   SET total TO 0  
3.   FOR each num IN nums  
4.     INCREMENT total BY num  
5.   SET avg TO total DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF nums  
6.   RETURN avg  
7. END FUNCTION
