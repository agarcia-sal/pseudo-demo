Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully self-contained, executable, clean, and idiomatic Python implementation by adhering strictly to the following enhanced instructions:

- **Preserve all identifiers and signatures exactly as specified:** This includes class names, method/function names, parameter names, ordering, and casing.
- **Retain the explicit nesting and indentation structure exactly as given:** This includes inner classes, nested functions, and their scopes.
- **Accurately convert all pseudocode constructs to proper Python syntax:**  
  - Use Python’s standard control flows (`for`, `while`, `if-else`), boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, etc.), and expressions faithfully.  
  - Use integer division `//` where division of integers is indicated.  
  - Translate loops over ranges exactly as given, and handle string or list indexing/slicing precisely.
- **Detect the need for helper data structures (e.g. ListNode, TreeNode) based on input signatures or context:**  
  - Define such helpers exactly within the scope indicated by the pseudocode (class-level or function-level).  
  - Implement minimal but robust conversion methods (`from_list`, `to_list`, `from_tree`, `to_tree`) that handle edge cases, empty inputs, and perform basic input validation aligned with common coding challenge best practices.  
  - Avoid unused helper definitions.
- **Maintain strict semantic equivalence with the pseudocode:**  
  - Do not reorder, remove, or rename variables or functions unless to improve clarity **without changing behavior or outputs**.  
  - Optimize variable naming only within local scopes and only if that increases clarity without semantic drift.
- **Add concise and idiomatic runtime input validation only if it improves correctness or robustness in typical coding challenge contexts (e.g., check for `None` or invalid types only when necessary to avoid crashes). Avoid redundant validation.**
- **Use only Python’s standard library and built-in features:**  
  - Prefer built-in functions and standard idioms to any external dependencies.  
  - Include imports only if absolutely necessary for correctness or clarity (e.g. `collections`, `heapq`, `math`), never third-party packages.
- **Embed all your output inside a single Python code block with triple backticks and `python`:**  
  ```python
  # your translated solution here
  ```  
- **Exclude all explanatory text, print/debug statements, main guards, or usage examples outside the code block.**
- **Respect exact output formats and return types as implied or stated in the pseudocode.**
- **Implement minimal, meaningful runtime safeguards to help meet a 5-second performance constraint if applicable:**  
  - For example, early input length checks, memoization for repeated subproblems, or pruning loops.
- **Aim for maximum semantic correctness, edge case coverage, and test pass rates:**  
  - Preserve all subtlety and details in pseudocode.  
  - Handle empty and boundary inputs exactly as expected from the pseudocode.
- **Do not invent or assume unstated behaviors or outputs beyond what the pseudocode implies.**
