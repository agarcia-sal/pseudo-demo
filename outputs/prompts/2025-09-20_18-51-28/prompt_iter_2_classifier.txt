Given the following pseudocode, perform a precise and comprehensive assessment of its reproducibility defined as the guaranteed ability to pass all relevant unit tests for its intended functionality. Evaluate all aspects including: completeness (no omitted or assumed steps), unambiguity (clear, well-defined operations and control flow), logical consistency (correct algorithmic reasoning without contradictions or gaps), and explicit input-output behavior specification. Determine if, based solely on the pseudocode, an implementation can be reliably constructed that produces correct and consistent results in every test scenario without external assumptions or corrections. Respond with exactly one digit: output 1 if the pseudocode meets these rigorous criteria to ensure reproducibility under all unit tests; otherwise output 0.  
When multiple pseudocodes are given in sequence, produce a sequence of digits (only 1s and 0s) matching their input order, without spaces, punctuation, or additional text.  
Output nothing else.
