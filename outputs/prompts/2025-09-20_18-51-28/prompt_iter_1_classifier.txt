Given the following pseudocode, analyze whether it is sufficiently complete, unambiguous, and logically consistent to pass all unit tests for its intended functionality. Consider correctness of algorithmic logic, clarity of control flow, adequacy of input-output specifications, and absence of contradictions or missing steps. If the pseudocode can be reliably executed to produce correct results in all tested cases, output 1; otherwise, output 0.  
Output only one digit: 1 or 0.
