Write clear, concise, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description that closely follows the original code's function, method, and class names (including their exact casing and nesting within classes or objects). Use natural language enriched with well-chosen symbolic notation (e.g., ←, +=, ==) and abbreviations to maintain brevity and clarity. Favor one-line statements whenever practical without losing clarity. Avoid verbose control keywords and omit separator lines or extra blank lines.

Format each line as a numbered statement like this:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Produce output consisting solely of the pseudocode, with no explanations, summaries, comments, or supplementary notes.

Example:  
Given the Python function
```python
def calc_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    avg = total / len(nums)
    return avg
```
Output pseudocode exactly as:
```
FUNCTION calc_average(nums)
    SET total TO 0
    FOR num IN nums
        INCREMENT total BY num
    SET avg TO total DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF nums
    RETURN avg
END FUNCTION
```
