Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, symbolic representations, abbreviations, and one-liners where possible, focusing on a compact, high-level style. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim to produce clear pseudocode that can be understood without additional notes. Your function has a 5-second timeout; generate the best possible result within this time.
