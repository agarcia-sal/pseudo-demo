Translate the given pseudocode into correct, efficient, and idiomatic Python code, strictly preserving all class names, function names, method signatures, and class/object structures as specified in the pseudocode. Your translation must:

- Enclose the entire code only within one Python code block formatted exactly as follows:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

- Import and use any standard Python libraries if needed for correctness or performance.

- Handle input formats and data types implied by the pseudocode (e.g., convert list inputs to linked lists or trees if required).

- Produce code that runs correctly within a 5-second time limit, optimizing for clarity, correctness, and performance without unnecessary verbosity.

- Avoid adding any explanation, comments, or text outside the single code block.

- Refrain from inventing additional helper classes or structures beyond the logical expectation of the pseudocode (unless necessary to implement stated logic).

- Avoid modifying any function or class signatures beyond their given names and parameters.

In short, faithfully realize the pseudocode's logic with robust Python code executable as-is, enclosed solely in one clean python code block with no extra content outside.
