```python
Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and optimally efficient Python code, preserving all class names, function names, method signatures, and class/object hierarchies exactly as in the pseudocode. Follow these enhanced guidelines to maximize correctness, clarity, and performance within a 5-second runtime limit:

- Output only a *single* Python code block enclosing the entire solution, with this exact formatting:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

- Keep all class and function names and signatures unchanged. Do not rename, remove, or add parameters unless explicitly required by the pseudocode.

- Accurately map pseudocode constructs and data types to Python equivalents: use lists for arrays, dicts for maps, tuples for fixed-size coordinate pairs, None for null, and so forth—prefer built-in types and standard library collections.

- Translate all control flow structures (loops, conditionals) precisely, preserving boundary checks, iteration ranges, and conditions exactly. Avoid off-by-one errors and faithfully replicate sentinel or special values used in the pseudocode.

- Employ Python standard libraries (e.g., collections, heapq, functools) liberally to improve clarity, robustness, and runtime efficiency—especially when mimicking data structures like deques, priority queues, or caching decorators. Avoid non-standard or external dependencies.

- Handle edge cases, input constraints, and implicit behaviors stated or strongly implied in the pseudocode, including empty inputs, boundary conditions, special values, and potential infinite loops or recursion. Incorporate memoization or iterative methods to prevent excessive recursion or runtime blow-up.

- Use Pythonic idioms for clarity and performance, such as list comprehensions, tuple unpacking, concise conditionals, and early returns. Avoid unnecessary verbosity or repeated code.

- Structure your code for readability and correctness first, then optimize bottlenecks by choosing appropriate algorithms or data structures consistent with the pseudocode logic.

- Do not add any metadata, comments, explanations, print/debug statements, or test code—output exclusively a single Python code block with the solution.

Your mission: deliver a rigorously faithful, robust, and high-performance Python implementation that exactly realizes the given pseudocode, structured as a complete, self-contained Python snippet within one code block as specified above.
