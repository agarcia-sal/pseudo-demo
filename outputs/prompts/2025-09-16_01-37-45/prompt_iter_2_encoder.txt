Write concise, clear, and easy-to-understand pseudocode strictly from the given problem description. Use more natural language combined with symbolic notations, abbreviations, and one-liners to achieve a compact, high-level style, while preserving all function and class names exactly as in the original code and maintaining their structure within classes or objects.

Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, summaries, comments, or purpose statements. Do not include any notes or clarifications.

Use the following format exactly, without extra lines or separators:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Prefer readability achieved by simple natural language phrases, minimal control words (like SET, INCREMENT, IF, FOR), symbolic operators (←, +, ==), and coherent high-level steps.

Example:

If the code is:  
```python
def calc_average(nums):  
    total = 0  
    for num in nums:  
        total += num  
    avg = total / len(nums)  
    return avg  
```

The pseudocode should be:  
```
FUNCTION calc_average(nums)  
    SET total TO 0  
    FOR num IN nums  
        INCREMENT total BY num  
    SET avg TO total DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF nums  
    RETURN avg  
END FUNCTION  
```
