```python
Translate the given pseudocode into a single, clean, idiomatic, and fully executable Python implementation, strictly preserving all class names, function/method names, signatures, and the class/object structure exactly as given. Follow these enhanced detailed instructions:

- Output only one Python code block wrapping the entire solution exactly as:
```python
# your translated code here
```

- Preserve all names, signatures, and hierarchies identically; do not rename or reorder components.

- Accurately and idiomatically translate pseudocode constructs into Python, mapping pseudocode data types to native types (lists, dicts, sets, None, etc.) appropriately and efficiently.

- Correctly implement all control structures, iteration bounds, edge conditions, and variable assignments, ensuring faithful logic reproduction.

- Where pseudocode suggests common algorithmic patterns, optimize by using standard Python idioms and built-in libraries (e.g., collections.deque for queues, itertools, heapq for priority queues, functools.lru_cache for memoization) to improve clarity and performance.

- Include minimal helper functions or classes only if necessary for faithful implementation or performance gains, and integrate them cleanly within the existing class structure if appropriate.

- Handle all implied edge cases robustly: boundary checks, empty inputs, special sentinel values, and recursion or iteration limits, to prevent runtime errors or infinite loops.

- Optimize for runtime efficiency aiming to complete execution within a 5-second timeout without sacrificing correctness or fidelity.

- Avoid extraneous output, debugging prints, comments, or explanations; produce only the executable code inside the single Python code block.

- Do not invent or modify the original problem logic beyond what the pseudocode specifies; implement the given algorithm exactly as described.

- When handling recursion, prevent maximum recursion depth issues by iterative conversions or explicit recursion limits if implied.

- Use standard Python packages without adding obscure or non-standard dependencies to ensure portability and clarity.

Your ultimate goal: generate a robust, performant, and exact Python code implementation embodying the pseudocodeâ€™s logic, held exclusively within one Python code block as shown.
