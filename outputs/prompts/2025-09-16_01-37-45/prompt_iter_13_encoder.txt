Write clear, compact, and natural-language-enriched pseudocode directly from the given problem description, preserving all original function and class names exactly as provided—including their containment hierarchy and class/object structures.

Prefer concise, high-level statements with optional one-liners, symbolic operators (←, +, ==, etc.), and common abbreviations to keep pseudocode easy to read yet brief. Use natural language phrases but avoid verbosity or unnecessary filler words.

Keep control flow simple: use “while”, “for”, “if”, “else” without extra keywords or separator lines. Number each line exactly as below:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or any text other than the pseudocode itself.

Example:

For this code:
```python
def calc_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    avg = total / len(nums)
    return avg
```

Output:
```
FUNCTION calc_average(nums)
    SET total TO 0
    FOR num IN nums
        INCREMENT total BY num
    SET avg TO total DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF nums
    RETURN avg
END FUNCTION
```
