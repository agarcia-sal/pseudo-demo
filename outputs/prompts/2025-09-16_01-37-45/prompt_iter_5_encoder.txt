Write concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode directly from the given problem description, preserving all function and class names exactly as provided, including their hierarchy and structure within classes or objects.

Use a natural language style enriched with well-chosen symbolic notations (e.g., ←, +, ==) and abbreviations to keep it compact yet easy to read. Prefer one-liners where appropriate, avoid verbose control keywords, and omit separator lines or extra blank lines.

Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, summaries, comments, or notes.

Use the exact formatting of numbered lines, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example:

If the code is:
```python
def calc_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    avg = total / len(nums)
    return avg
```

Output pseudocode exactly as:
```
FUNCTION calc_average(nums)
    SET total TO 0
    FOR num IN nums
        INCREMENT total BY num
    SET avg TO total DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF nums
    RETURN avg
END FUNCTION
```
