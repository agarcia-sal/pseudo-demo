Write clear, concise, and easy-to-understand pseudocode directly from the given problem description, using mostly natural language enriched with well-chosen symbolic notations (e.g., ←, +, ==) and commonly accepted abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Preserve all original function and class names exactly as given, maintaining their hierarchical and structural relationships within classes or objects.

Prefer expressing control flow and operations in one-liners where it enhances readability and brevity; avoid verbose control keywords and omit any separator lines or extra blank lines.

Output only the pseudocode, without any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes.

Use numbered lines for each statement, strictly following this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example:

Given this code snippet:
```python
def calc_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    avg = total / len(nums)
    return avg
```

Output pseudocode exactly as:

```
FUNCTION calc_average(nums)
    SET total TO 0
    FOR num IN nums
        INCREMENT total BY num
    SET avg TO total DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF nums
    RETURN avg
END FUNCTION
```
