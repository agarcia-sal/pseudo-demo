Write clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode strictly from the given problem description, preserving all original function and class names exactly—including their hierarchy and nesting within classes or objects.

Produce pseudocode that is compact, easy to read, and natural in style, using well-chosen symbolic notation (e.g., ←, +, ==) and common abbreviations. Favor one-line statements when possible, minimize verbose control keywords, and avoid separator lines or blank lines.

Number each line precisely as follows:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, summaries, comments, or formatting beyond line numbers.

Example:  
If the input code is:
```python
def calc_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    avg = total / len(nums)
    return avg
```
Output pseudocode as:
```
FUNCTION calc_average(nums)
    SET total TO 0
    FOR num IN nums
        INCREMENT total BY num
    SET avg TO total DIVIDED BY LENGTH OF nums
    RETURN avg
END FUNCTION
```
