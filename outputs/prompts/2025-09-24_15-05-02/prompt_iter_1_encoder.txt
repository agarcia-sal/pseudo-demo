Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that uses natural language combined with symbolic notation. The pseudocode should be compact, high-level, and prefer one-liners, abbreviations, and symbolic operations. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, notes, comments, or explanationsâ€”only the pseudocode itself. Ensure clarity and understandability within the pseudocode using readable structure and indentation where appropriate. Your response must complete within 5 seconds.
