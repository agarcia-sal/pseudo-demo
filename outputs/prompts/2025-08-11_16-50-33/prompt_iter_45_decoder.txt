Translate the provided pseudocode into a single, self-contained, and fully working Python program that strictly:

- Uses only `input()` for reading from standard input, with no arguments inside `input()`.
- Prints only what is necessary to fulfill the program's requirementsâ€”no additional output, formatting, or commentary.
- Includes all code inside one Python code block formatted exactly as:
```python
# your complete translated solution here
```
- Writes clear, efficient, and correct Python code optimized for performance within a 5-second runtime.
- Leverages any built-in or standard Python libraries as needed to maximize correctness and speed.
- Avoids all explanations, comments, or any text outside the single Python code block.

Here is the pseudocode:
