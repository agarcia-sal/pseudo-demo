Generate concise, clear, and compact high-level pseudocode exactly matching the problem description. Use mostly natural language mixed with common symbolic notations and abbreviations to keep it brief and easy to read. Express each instruction preferably as a single line. Number every step sequentially starting from 1. Use consistent, straightforward variable and function names without redundancy. Show indentation to indicate nested blocks, exactly as in the example below. Avoid any summaries, explanations, comments, or extra text. Do not include separator lines or notes. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps in this precise format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example of the expected style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
