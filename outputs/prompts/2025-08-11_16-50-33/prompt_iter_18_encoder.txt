Generate concise, clear, high-level pseudocode that solves the problem exactly as described. Make the pseudocode easy to read and understand by using mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact yet explicit. Prefer single-line instructions with minimal but necessary indentation for nested blocks. Use straightforward, consistent variable and function names without redundancy or verbosity. Number each step starting from 1 and output only the numbered pseudocode lines—no explanations, summaries, comments, or separators. Follow this exact format and style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example output matching this style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
