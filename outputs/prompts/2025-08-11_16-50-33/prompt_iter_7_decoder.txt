Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code.  
**Requirements:**  
- Enclose your entire solution strictly within a single Python code block using triple backticks and the `python` tag:  
```python  
# your solution here  
```  
- Your code should read input(s) using `input()` without any prompt strings or separators.  
- Use only standard or commonly available Python libraries if needed, but keep dependencies minimal.  
- Focus on correctness, readability, and optimal performance to guarantee execution within 5 seconds.  
- Do not include any explanation, comments beyond what enhances clarity, or extraneous outputâ€”only the code block.  

Here is the pseudocode:
