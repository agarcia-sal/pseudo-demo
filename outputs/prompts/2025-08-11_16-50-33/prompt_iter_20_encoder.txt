Generate concise, clear pseudocode that solves the problem exactly as described, using mostly natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations for brevity. Make it compact and high-level, favoring single-line instructions whenever possible. Number each step starting at 1. Use consistent, simple variable and function names with no redundancy. Indent nested blocks clearly, following the style shown below. Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps exactly as in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example output expected:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 forj = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
