Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that directly solves the problem as described.  
Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact, clear, and easy to read.  
Express steps as single lines wherever possible, using terse control structures (for, while, if with inline actions) for brevity without losing clarity.  
Number each step starting at 1; show nesting by consistent indentation (tabs or spaces matching depth).  
Choose simple, unique, meaningful variable and function names; avoid redundancy or verbosity.  
Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or separator lines—output only the numbered pseudocode steps exactly in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
