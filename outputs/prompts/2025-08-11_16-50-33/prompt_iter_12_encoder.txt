Generate concise, clear, and compact pseudocode that solves the problem exactly as described. Use mostly natural language mixed with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Write mostly single-line instructions and maintain high-level clarity. Number each step starting from 1. Use consistent, simple variable and function names without redundancy. Indent nested blocks using tabs or spaces as shown. Do not include explanations, summaries, comments, or separator lines. Output only the pseudocode steps in this exact numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example of the expected style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 forj = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
