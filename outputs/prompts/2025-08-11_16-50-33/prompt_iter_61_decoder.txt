```
Given the pseudocode below, generate a complete, efficient, and idiomatic Python program that correctly implements the described algorithm.  

Requirements:
- Read all input exclusively using bare input() calls without any arguments or prompt text.
- Output exactly what the problem requires, nothing more or less.
- Enclose your entire solution in a single Python code block exactly as follows:  
```python  
# Your full working Python program here  
```  
- Use clear, meaningful variable names and leverage Python standard libraries as needed for clarity, performance, and simplicity.
- Optimize your code to run within a 5-second time limit, employing best algorithmic practices.
- Do not include any comments, explanations, debugging output, or extraneous textâ€”only the final code block.
- Avoid unnecessary imports; only import what directly benefits the solution.
