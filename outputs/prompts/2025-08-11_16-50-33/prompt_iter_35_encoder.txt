Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that solves the problem exactly as described. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Prefer single-line instructions; indent nested blocks as shown in the example. Use clear, consistent, non-redundant names for variables and functions. Number each step starting from 1 and output only the numbered pseudocode lines—no explanations, summaries, comments, or separators. Follow this exact numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example output matching this style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
