Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode that exactly solves the problem as described. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand with mostly natural language, using symbolic notation and common abbreviations to stay compact. Prefer single-line instructions when possible; use indentation only for nested blocks. Number each step from 1 in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use consistent, simple variable and function names without redundancy. Do not include explanations, summaries, comments, notes, or separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps exactly as shown.

Example pseudocode style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
