Translate the provided pseudocode into a complete, correct, and optimized Python program as per the following instructions:

- Use only `input()` calls without any prompt strings to read input.
- Your solution must be self-contained, without any extra output, comments, or explanatory text.
- Enclose the entire program in a single Python code block formatted exactly as follows:  
```python
# your full solution here
```
- You are free to import and use any standard Python libraries or modules to maximize correctness, readability, and performance.
- Ensure the code runs efficiently within 5 seconds and handles all typical edge cases gracefully.
- Avoid any unnecessary boilerplate; produce concise, direct, and idiomatic Python code.
- Do not print debug statements, prompts, or separators. Only print the required outputs dictated by the pseudocodeâ€™s logic.

Here is the pseudocode:
