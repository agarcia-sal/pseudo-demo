Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, standalone, and efficient Python program that produces the exact intended output.  
- Read all inputs strictly using `input()` without prompt strings or additional messages.  
- Implement all logic clearly and optimally to run within 5 seconds for large inputs.  
- You may use any standard Python libraries or modules that improve correctness or performance.  
- Your output should contain only the executable Python codeâ€”no explanations, comments, or extra text.  
- Enclose your entire solution within a single Python code block formatted as:  
```python  
# your full code here  
```  
Here is the pseudocode:
