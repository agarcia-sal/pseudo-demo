Generate clear, concise, and easy-to-read high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations to keep it compact and intuitive. Structure the pseudocode as numbered lines starting from 1, with each line representing a single instruction or control statement, preferably as a one-liner. Use straightforward commands, variables, control flow, and data operations without redundancy. Do not include any explanations, comments, notes, summaries, or overviews—only the pseudocode steps. Avoid separator lines or decorations. Follow this style exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce output purely as pseudocode that directly solves the problem as described, using concise expressions and clear logic. Example of expected pseudocode style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
