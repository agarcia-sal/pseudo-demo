Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that exactly solves the given problem. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand, using mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and clear. Favor single-line statements wherever possible. Use consistent, simple, non-redundant variable and function names. Apply indentation to reflect nested control structures as in the example below. Do not provide explanations, summaries, notes, comments, or separator lines. Output only the pseudocode steps with sequential numbering starting at 1, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example output matching this style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
