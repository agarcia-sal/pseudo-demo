Generate clear, concise, and compact high-level pseudocode that precisely implements the described problem.  
Write mostly natural language with symbolic operators and common abbreviations to keep it brief and immediately understandable.  
Produce one-line instructions wherever possible, including control flow lines (loops, conditionals) written succinctly after the colon.  
Number each step starting at 1. Indent nested blocks with consistent tabs or spaces matching the level of nesting only.  
Use simple, meaningful, consistent names for variables, functions, and types without redundancy or over-specification.  
Omit any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes. Output strictly the numbered pseudocode lines in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example style your output must follow exactly:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
