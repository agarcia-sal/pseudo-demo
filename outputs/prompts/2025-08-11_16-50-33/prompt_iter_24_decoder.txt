Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, optimized, and idiomatic Python program. Follow these strict guidelines:

- Use only `input()` without any prompt strings for all inputs.
- Produce exactly the code required to implement the pseudocodeâ€™s logic with no explanations, comments, or additional text.
- Output your entire solution enclosed in a single Python code block formatted exactly as:
```python
# your complete code here
```
- Prioritize correctness, efficiency, and readability while ensuring the code will execute within 5 seconds.
- You may freely use any standard Python libraries or modules to improve clarity or performance.
- Handle all input/output strictly through standard input/output as required by the problem.
- Avoid any superfluous print statements, debugging code, or separators.

Here is the pseudocode:
