Generate clear, concise, and compact high-level pseudocode that directly solves the problem as described. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it brief yet precise. Prefer single-line instructions for assignments, control flow, and operations. Number each step starting from 1. Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or separator lines. Use consistent, straightforward variable and function names without redundancy. Follow this exact step-by-step numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Only output the pseudocode steps exactly in this style.

Example output matching this style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
