Translate the given pseudocode into a single, self-contained, and highly efficient Python script that:  
- Reads all inputs exclusively using `input()` with no prompt strings or additional input instructions.  
- Uses only standard libraries or widely available Python packages to maximize correctness and performance.  
- Implements the logic clearly and concisely, avoiding unnecessary variables or complexity.  
- Optimizes for runtime performance under 5 seconds for typical problem constraints.  
- Produces exactly the required output and nothing elseâ€”no explanations, comments, or extraneous text.  
- Wraps the entire solution within a single Python code block formatted exactly as shown below:  
```python  
# your complete translated solution here  
```  
Here is the pseudocode:
