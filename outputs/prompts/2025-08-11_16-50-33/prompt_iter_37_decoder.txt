Translate the following pseudocode into a standalone, optimized, and idiomatic Python program meeting these criteria:

- Use only `input()` without any prompt strings for all inputs.
- Read inputs efficiently and handle multiple or complex inputs as typically implied by the pseudocode.
- Implement the full solution so it can run independently and produce the correct output(s).
- Utilize any appropriate standard Python libraries to improve clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Ensure the code is clean, concise, and completes execution within 5 seconds for typical input sizes.
- Do not add any comments, explanations, or extra outputâ€”only the exact code is required.
- Output the entire solution enclosed strictly in a single Python code block formatted like this:
```python
# your fully translated and optimized code here
```
