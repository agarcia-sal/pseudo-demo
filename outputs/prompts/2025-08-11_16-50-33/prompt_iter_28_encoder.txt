Generate clear, concise pseudocode that directly solves the given problem exactly as described. Use natural language mixed with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Prefer single-line instructions whenever possible. Number each step starting from 1. Use consistent, simple variable and function names without redundancy. Indent nested blocks using tabs or spaces, similar to the example below. Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or any extra text—output only numbered pseudocode steps in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example output style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
