```
Convert the given pseudocode into a fully functional, efficient, and clean Python program that precisely implements the described logic.  
- Your program must read all inputs strictly with `input()` calls — no prompt strings or extra arguments allowed.  
- Output only what the problem requires, nothing else.  
- Wrap your entire code inside a single Python code block exactly as follows:  
```python  
# complete Python solution here  
```  
- Use Python’s standard libraries freely if they improve clarity, performance, or brevity; avoid unnecessary imports.  
- Emphasize clear, meaningful variable names, idiomatic Python style, and algorithmic efficiency to comfortably run within a 5-second limit.  
- Exclude any comments, explanations, debugging code, or any text outside the specified code block.  
Below is the pseudocode you need to convert:
