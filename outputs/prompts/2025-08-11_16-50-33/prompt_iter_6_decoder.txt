Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that reads all inputs using plain `input()` calls (without prompt strings). Your code should be ready to run as-is, handle inputs from standard input correctly, and produce the expected outputs within 5 seconds. Use any standard Python libraries if they improve clarity or performance.  
**Important:**  
- Enclose your entire solution within a single Python code block, using triple backticks and the `python` tag, exactly as shown below:  
```python  
# your complete python code here  
```  
- Do **not** include any extra explanations, comments, or separators in your outputâ€”only the code block.  
- Avoid adding any prompt text inside `input()` calls; simply use `input()`.  
- Focus on correctness, readability, and optimal performance.
