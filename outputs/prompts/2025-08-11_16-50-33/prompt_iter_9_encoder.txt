Generate concise, clear, high-level pseudocode that solves the problem exactly as described. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and readable. Express every instruction in a single line when possible. Number each step starting from 1. Use straightforward, consistent variable and function names without redundancy. Do not include any explanations, summaries, comments, or separator lines. Follow this exact numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode steps exactly in this style, with indentation for nested blocks as shown in the example.

Example output matching this style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
