Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that exactly solves the given problem.  
Use mainly natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to read.  
Prefer single-line instructions with concise control-flow expressions and minimal nesting.  
Number each step starting at 1, indent nested blocks consistently with tabs or spaces matching nesting level.  
Use simple, meaningful, and consistent variable and function names without redundancy.  
Output only the numbered pseudocode steps in this exact format, with no explanations, comments, summaries, or separator lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
