Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, optimized, and idiomatic Python program.  
- Use standard Python 3 syntax and libraries; you may import any modules that improve correctness, readability, or performance.  
- Read all inputs strictly via `input()` calls with no prompt strings or extra arguments.  
- Produce only the exact output required by the problemâ€”no debugging information, comments, explanations, or extraneous prints.  
- Structure your code for clarity and efficiency, ensuring it reliably runs within a 5-second time limit for typical competitive programming constraints.  
- Enclose your entire answer in a single Python code block formatted precisely as follows:  
```python  
# complete, ready-to-run Python solution here  
```  
Here is the pseudocode:
