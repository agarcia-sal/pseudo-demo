Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, optimized Python program that strictly adheres to the following requirements:  
- Use only `input()` without any prompts for reading all inputs.  
- Ensure the output and behavior strictly match the pseudocode’s intended functionality with no extra prints, comments, or explanations.  
- Implement the entire solution inside one Python code block formatted exactly as:  
```python  
# complete translated solution here  
```  
- You may import and use any standard or commonly available Python libraries to maximize correctness, readability, and efficiency.  
- The solution must be robust, concise, and execute within 5 seconds on all realistic input sizes.  
- Avoid any extraneous text, commentary, or debug output — produce only the minimal code that fully solves the problem indicated by the pseudocode.  
Here is the pseudocode:
