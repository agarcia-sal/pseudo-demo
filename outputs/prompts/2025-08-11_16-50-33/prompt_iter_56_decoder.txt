```
You are given a pseudocode describing an algorithm or task.  
Write a fully working, efficient, and clean Python program that implements the pseudocode to solve the described problem. 

Requirements:  
- Use only built-in `input()` for reading all inputs; no prompts or arguments inside `input()`.  
- Output exactly what the problem requiresâ€”no extra prints, messages, or blank lines.  
- Use concise, idiomatic Python with clear, meaningful variable names.  
- Optimize for correctness, readability, and performance within a 5-second execution limit.  
- You may import any standard Python libraries as needed, but avoid unnecessary imports.  
- Do NOT include comments, explanations, or debugging code.  
- Output only the complete code enclosed strictly within one Python code block formatted as:  
```python  
# complete solution here  
```  

Here is the pseudocode to convert:
