Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that directly solves the problem exactly as described.  
Use clear, natural language with common abbreviations and symbolic notation to keep it brief and readable.  
Prefer single-line steps, combining condition and action when possible (e.g., "while x < n: x++").  
Number each step starting at 1; indent nested blocks with consistent tabs or spaces matching nesting level.  
Use simple, meaningful, and consistent names for variables and functions without redundancy.  
Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or separators—output only the numbered pseudocode steps in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
	set min_i to i  
	for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
