Generate concise, clear, and readable pseudocode that exactly solves the described problem.  
Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and typical abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level.  
Prefer single-line statements whenever possible, using indentation to show nested blocks.  
Number each instruction starting at 1, with consistent, simple variable and function names.  
Avoid redundancy, explanations, summaries, comments, or separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example output matching this style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
