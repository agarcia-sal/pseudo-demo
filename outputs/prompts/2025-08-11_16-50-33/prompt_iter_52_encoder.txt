Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that precisely solves the problem as described.  
Use clear, natural language with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it compact, readable, and easy to follow.  
Prefer mostly single-line steps and terse control structures (e.g., for, while, if with inline actions) to ensure brevity without losing clarity.  
Number steps starting from 1 and use consistent indentation (tabs or spaces) to indicate nested blocks.  
Choose simple, distinct, meaningful variable and function names; avoid redundancy or verbosity.  
Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or separators—output only the numbered pseudocode steps strictly in this form:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example of target style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
