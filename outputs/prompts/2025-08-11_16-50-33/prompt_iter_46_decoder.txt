Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully working, optimized Python program enclosed in a single code block as specified below. Your program must:

- Use only `input()` calls without any prompt strings for reading inputs.
- Not include any extraneous output such as debug prints, explanations, or comments.
- Use built-in or standard Python libraries as needed to maximize correctness, clarity, and runtime efficiency.
- Handle all necessary input parsing and output formatting exactly as required by the pseudocode logic.
- Complete execution within 5 seconds on typical modern hardware.
- Enclose the entire solution strictly within one Python code block formatted as:
```python
# Your complete and final translated code here
```
