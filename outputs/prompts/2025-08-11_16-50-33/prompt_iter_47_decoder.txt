Translate the provided pseudocode into a single, fully functional Python program that adheres strictly to the following requirements:  
- Read all inputs exclusively using `input()` with no argument strings.  
- Implement exactly the behavior described by the pseudocode without adding explanations, comments, or any output besides what the program requires.  
- Use any built-in or standard Python libraries to maximize clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiency, ensuring the code executes within 5 seconds for all test cases.  
- Return only the Python code enclosed in a single, properly formatted code block as shown below:  
```python  
# your complete, optimized Python solution here  
```  
Here is the pseudocode:
