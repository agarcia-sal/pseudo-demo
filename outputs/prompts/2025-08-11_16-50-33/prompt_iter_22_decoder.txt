Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, optimized Python program that:  
- Reads all inputs strictly using `input()` without any prompt strings.  
- Handles input parsing and processing robustly, assuming standard competitive programming input formats.  
- Uses any necessary and allowed standard Python libraries to maximize correctness, readability, and efficiency.  
- Produces exactly the required outputs with no extra text, comments, or explanations.  
- Is contained entirely within a single Python code block formatted as:  
```python  
# Complete, clean, and optimized Python solution here  
```  
- Adheres to a time constraint of 5 seconds for execution on typical input sizes.  
- Prioritizes minimal runtime and memory usage while maintaining clarity and correctness.  

Here is the pseudocode:
