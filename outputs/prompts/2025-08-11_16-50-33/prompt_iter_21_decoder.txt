Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, optimized, and idiomatic Python program that meets the following conditions:

- Your solution must use `input()` exactly as is (no prompt strings) for all input reading.
- The code should produce no extraneous output other than what is logically required by the problem.
- Implement the entire solution in a single Python code block formatted as shown:
```python
# Complete translated Python solution here
```
- You may use any standard or third-party Python libraries to improve clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Prioritize writing clean, readable, and efficient code that reliably executes within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or text outside the Python code block.
- Avoid any unnecessary formatting, separators, or extra printsâ€”only output the final executable code.
  
Here is the pseudocode:
