Translate the provided pseudocode into a single, self-contained, efficient, and idiomatic Python program that:  
- Reads all inputs exclusively using `input()` with no prompt strings.  
- Outputs only the results as dictated by the pseudocode (no extra print statements or comments).  
- Completes execution within 5 seconds on typical problem constraints.  
- Uses any standard Python libraries as needed to maximize correctness, performance, and clarity.  
- Handles edge cases and large inputs gracefully.  
- Is enclosed in one Python code block as shown below:  

```python
# entire translated solution here
```  

Do not output anything else besides this single, complete, runnable code block.  
Here is the pseudocode:
