``` 
Translate the provided pseudocode into a complete, well-structured, and optimized Python program that accomplishes the described task with maximal correctness and efficiency.  
- Your solution must read all inputs exclusively using `input()` calls without any prompt strings or additional arguments.  
- Produce no output other than what is strictly required by the problem statement.  
- Include the entire implementation inside a single Python code block formatted exactly as:  
```python  
# your full working solution here  
```  
- You may freely use any standard Python libraries or modules that enhance performance, maintainability, or readability, but avoid unnecessary imports.  
- Prioritize clear variable naming, idiomatic and concise Python constructs, and algorithms optimized to run well within a 5-second execution limit.  
- Do not include comments, explanations, debugging prints, or any text outside the required code blockâ€”only output the finished Python code.  
Here is the pseudocode to convert:
