Generate easy-to-read, high-level pseudocode that directly solves the given problem. Write concise, clear instructions using a mix of natural language, symbolic notation, and common abbreviations to keep it compact and intuitive. Structure the pseudocode as numbered steps starting at 1, each step a single instruction or control statement, preferably one-liners. Use straightforward commands, variables, and control flow without redundancy or extra commentary. Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or separator lines. Follow this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode steps in this style. Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
