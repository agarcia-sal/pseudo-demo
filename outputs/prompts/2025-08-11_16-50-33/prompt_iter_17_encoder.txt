Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode that exactly solves the problem as described. Use mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to read. Write predominantly single-line instructions; indent nested blocks as shown in the example. Use consistent, simple variable and function names without redundancy. Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the numbered pseudocode steps exactly in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example of the required pseudocode style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 forj=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
