Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, optimized, and clean Python program adhering to the following requirements:

- Use only `input()` for all inputs without any prompt strings or additional text.
- The final output must be solely the Python code implementing the logic described in the pseudocodeâ€”no comments, explanations, or extra output.
- Enclose the entire solution within a single, properly formatted Python code block:  
  ```python
  # your complete Python solution here
  ```
- You may freely use any standard Python libraries or modules to maximize code clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Ensure the program is efficient enough to run within 5 seconds on typical input sizes.
- Avoid adding separator lines or any other formatting outside the code block.
- Prioritize precise adherence to the pseudocode's logic while producing idiomatic, concise, and maintainable Python code.

Here is the pseudocode:
