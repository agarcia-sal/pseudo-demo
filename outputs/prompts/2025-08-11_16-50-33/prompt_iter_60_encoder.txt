Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that directly solves the problem as described, using mostly natural language combined with clear symbolic notation and common abbreviations.  
Prefer terse one-liners and inline control flow (e.g., for, while, if with immediate actions) to keep it compact, easy to read, and unambiguous.  
Number each step starting from 1, indent consistently to show nested blocks (tabs or spaces, matching depth), and use simple, meaningful, unique names without verbosity or redundancy.  
Output only the numbered pseudocode steps—no explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or separator lines.  
Follow this exact format example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
