Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, clean, and fully functional Python code that meets the following criteria:  
- Read all inputs using only `input()` with no arguments.  
- Do not print or output anything except what the problem's logic requires.  
- Use Python standard libraries or modules to maximize correctness, efficiency, and readability.  
- Ensure the complete solution fits within a single Python code block, formatted exactly as below, without any additional text, comments, or explanation:  
```python  
# Your complete, final Python solution here  
```  
- Focus on producing code that is not only correct but also efficient enough to run within 5 seconds even for large inputs.  
- Do not include any prompt messages, debug output, or separators.  
Here is the pseudocode:
