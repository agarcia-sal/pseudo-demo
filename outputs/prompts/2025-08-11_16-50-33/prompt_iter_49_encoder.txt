Generate clear, concise, and compact high-level pseudocode that directly solves the problem as described.  
Use mostly natural language enriched with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it brief, readable, and precise.  
Prefer single-line statements and terse control flow expressions; collapse simple blocks onto one line when unambiguous.  
Number each step starting from 1. Indent nested blocks consistently by one tab or equivalent spaces per level.  
Choose meaningful, short, and consistent variable and function names without redundancy.  
Do not include explanations, summaries, comments, notes, or separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
