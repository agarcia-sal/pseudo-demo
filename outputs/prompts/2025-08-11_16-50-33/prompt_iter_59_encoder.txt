Generate concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode that fully solves the given problem exactly as described.  
Use mostly natural language mixed with well-known symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to read.  
Express each step in a single line when possible, using terse control flow forms (e.g., for, while, if with inline actions) to preserve brevity without losing clarity or correctness.  
Number each step starting from 1, indent consistently using tabs or spaces to reflect nesting depth.  
Choose simple, meaningful, and unique names for variables and functions; avoid redundancy and verbosity.  
Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or separators—output only the numbered pseudocode steps in the exact form below:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example pseudocode style your output should follow:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
