```
Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, efficient, and idiomatic Python program that solves the described task precisely and within a 5-second execution limit.  
- Your program must read all inputs exclusively via `input()` calls without any prompt strings or parameters.  
- Output strictly what the problem demands; do not produce extra text, prompts, or debug information.  
- Deliver your entire solution inside **one Python code block** formatted exactly as:  
```python  
# complete, optimized solution here  
```  
- Use any built-in or standard Python libraries if they improve correctness, readability, or performance, but avoid unnecessary imports.  
- Favor clear, meaningful variable names and concise, Pythonic constructs; optimize algorithms to handle large inputs efficiently under the time constraint.  
- Do NOT include comments, explanations, unused code, or output outside of the required code block.  
Here is the pseudocode to convert:
