Generate concise, clear, high-level pseudocode exactly solving the problem as described. Output only the pseudocode steps with no explanations, summaries, or comments. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to read. Prefer single-line instructions and inline conditions whenever possible. Number each step starting at 1. Use consistent, simple variable and function names without redundancy. Indent nested blocks by one tab per level, exactly as shown below. Do not use separator lines or extra formatting.

Format each step like this:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
