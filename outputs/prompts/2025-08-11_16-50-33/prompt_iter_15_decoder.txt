Translate the provided pseudocode into a complete, efficient, and idiomatic Python program that runs correctly within 5 seconds.  
- Use only `input()` without prompt strings for all input operations.  
- The output should strictly be the programâ€™s direct outputs, without any debugging information, extra prints, explanations, or comments.  
- The entire solution must be enclosed in a single Python code block:  
```python  
# your full translated code here  
```  
- Employ any standard Python libraries or language features to maximize correctness, clarity, and performance.  
- Structure the code for readability and maintainability, using functions or classes if appropriate, but remain concise.  
- Avoid any placeholder or template code; produce a directly runnable solution that matches the pseudocode logic exactly.  

Here is the pseudocode:
