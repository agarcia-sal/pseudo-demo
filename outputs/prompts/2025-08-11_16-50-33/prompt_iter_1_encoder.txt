Generate concise, easy-to-read, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations. Structure pseudocode in numbered lines following this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode instructions. Prefer one-liners and compact expressions. Use clear but succinct commands, variables, and flow control. Your output should be purely the pseudocode that solves the problem as described.
