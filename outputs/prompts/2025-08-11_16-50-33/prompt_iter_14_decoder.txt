Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, optimized Python script that can run correctly within 5 seconds.  

- Use `input()` **without** any prompt strings for reading all inputs.  
- Implement the exact logic described in the pseudocode, ensuring correctness and efficiency.  
- You may import and use any built-in or standard Python libraries to improve performance or clarity.  
- The solution must be a single, self-contained script enclosed exclusively within one Python code block formatted as:  
```python  
# entire translated solution here  
```  
- Do **not** include any comments, explanations, or additional textâ€”output only the code block.  
- Avoid any decorative separators, debug prints, or extra output beyond what is required by the logic.  
- Write clean, idiomatic, and performant Python code suitable for diverse problem statements.  

Here is the pseudocode:
