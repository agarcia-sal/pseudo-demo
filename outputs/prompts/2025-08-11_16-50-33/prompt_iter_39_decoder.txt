Translate the provided pseudocode into a single, efficient, and fully functional Python script enclosed in triple backticks with `python` syntax highlighting, like so:

```python
# your complete translated solution here
```

Requirements:
- Use only `input()` without any prompt strings to read all input values.
- Do not output anything other than what the pseudocodeâ€™s logic requires.
- Ensure the code is clean, concise, and optimized both for correctness and performance within a 5-second runtime.
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries or modules to maximize efficiency.
- Do not add explanations, comments, blank lines, or extra text outside the code block.
- Handle all inputs and outputs exactly as per the pseudocode instructions.

Here is the pseudocode:
