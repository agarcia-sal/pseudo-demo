Generate concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode that solves the problem exactly as described, prioritizing readability and compactness. Use mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Write one instruction per line whenever possible, numbering steps starting at 1. Use consistent and straightforward variable and function names without redundancy. Show nested blocks by indenting with a tab character as in the example. Avoid any explanations, summaries, comments, or extra notes. Do not include separator lines or additional formatting beyond what is demonstrated. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps exactly like this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example output matching expected style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
