Generate concise, clear, high-level pseudocode to solve the problem exactly as described, using mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it compact and readable. Express each instruction in a single line when possible. Number every step starting from 1. Use straightforward, consistent variable and function names without redundancy. Use indentation to indicate nested blocks. Avoid all explanations, summaries, comments, or separator lines. The output must be only the pseudocode steps in this exact numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example output matching this style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i + 1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
