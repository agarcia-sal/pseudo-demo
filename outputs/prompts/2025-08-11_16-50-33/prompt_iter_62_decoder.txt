```
Convert the given pseudocode into a fully functional, efficient, and idiomatic Python program that correctly solves the specified problem under tight performance constraints.

Requirements:
- Read all input exclusively using `input()` with no prompt strings or parameters.
- Produce output exactly as required by the problem statement; no extra prints, logging, or debug output.
- Use only one Python code block formatted precisely as:
```python
# full implementation here
```
- Optimize for clarity, maintainability, and runtime efficiency.
- Use Python standard libraries or well-known modules if they significantly improve performance or code simplicity, but avoid unnecessary imports.
- Use precise and descriptive variable names.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or any text outside the single code block.
- Ensure the solution runs within 5 seconds on large inputs.

Here is the pseudocode to translate:
