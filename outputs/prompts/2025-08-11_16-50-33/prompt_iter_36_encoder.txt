Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that exactly solves the given problem. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Structure logic with indentation for nested blocks. Favor single-line instructions whenever possible. Number each step starting at 1, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use clear, consistent variable and function names without redundancy. Do not include any explanations, summaries, comments, notes, or separator lines. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps exactly as specified.

Example output style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 forj=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
