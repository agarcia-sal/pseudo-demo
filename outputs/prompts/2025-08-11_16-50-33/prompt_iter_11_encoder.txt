Generate concise, clear, high-level pseudocode that solves the problem exactly as described. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using mostly natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Prefer single-line instructions whenever possible. Number each step starting from 1. Use consistent, straightforward variable and function names without redundancy. Include indentation for nested blocks as in the example. Do not provide any explanations, summaries, comments, notes, or separator lines. Output only the pseudocode steps in this exact numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Example output matching this style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
