Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and optimized Python code. Your implementation must satisfy these requirements:

- Enclose the entire solution within a single Python code block using triple backticks and the `python` tag:
```python
# code here
```
- Your code should read inputs using `input()` without any prompt strings.
- Use standard or widely available Python libraries if needed, optimizing for clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiency so the solution executes within 5 seconds.
- Do not include any explanations, comments beyond minimal necessary for clarity, or any output other than the required solution code.
- Ensure your code correctly handles edge cases and is production-quality with proper variable naming and structure.

Here is the pseudocode to translate:
