Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic representations and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Output only the pseudocode without any purpose, summary, overview statements, or explanatory notes. Prefer one-liners when possible. Follow this format with numbered steps:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure clarity and readability, avoiding comments or detailed explanations. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to produce the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
