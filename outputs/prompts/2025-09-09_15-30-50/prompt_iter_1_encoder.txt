Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be compact, high-level, use natural language with one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this numbered-line format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode is understandable and fits within a 5-second generation limit.
