Given a standalone pseudocode snippet describing a function or class method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, your goal is to determine definitively whether **any** faithful, straightforward implementation derived solely from this pseudocode will pass **all** valid unit tests for that problem without exception.

You must output exactly one digit per pseudocode input, in the exact order they are given, and nothing else:  
- Output **1** if the pseudocode guarantees full reproducibility (passing all tests).  
- Output **0** otherwise.

To decide confidently and correctly, ensure the pseudocode meets *all* of these stringent criteria simultaneously, without exception or ambiguity:

1. **Complete Problem Specification and Context:**  
   The pseudocode independently and clearly defines the problem’s input types, formats, domains, and expected outputs without relying on external context or unstated assumptions.

2. **Precise and Full Interface Definition:**  
   The function or method signature includes all parameters, their exact types and names, return type, and contextual encapsulation (class/module) explicitly and completely, matching the problem’s requirements exactly.

3. **Explicit, Deterministic, and Complete Algorithmic Logic:**  
   Every computational step, condition, loop, recursion, data structure initialization and mutation, termination condition, and control flow construct is fully described without gaps, omissions, or unhandled boundary cases.

4. **Thorough Edge Case and Error Handling:**  
   All possible edge cases, special input conditions, and error states are explicitly handled or guaranteed impossible by logic—no undefined or ambiguous behavior remains.

5. **Unambiguous Instruction Semantics:**  
   Each operation (arithmetic, indexing, string/data manipulation, control statements) is described with unambiguous, language-agnostic clarity, avoiding nonspecific shorthand, symbolic placeholders, or implicit interpretation.

6. **Consistent Logical Flow and Internal Coherence:**  
   The pseudocode contains no contradictions, missing steps, or logical inconsistencies; intermediate states and data flows are clear, properly connected, and complete.

7. **Direct Translational Implementability:**  
   The pseudocode is structured and detailed enough so a competent programmer could translate it into correct, syntactically valid code in a standard programming language *without making guesses or filling in omitted details.*

8. **Explicit Constraint Enforcement and Domain Guarantee:**  
   All problem-specific constraints, invariants, resource bounds, or ordering rules critical for correctness are explicitly enforced or logically guaranteed, not merely implied.

9. **Self-Containment—No External or Omitted Dependencies:**  
   The pseudocode specification is fully self-sufficient and contains everything needed for correctness; it does not call or depend on any unstated functions, libraries, external inputs, or omitted steps.

10. **Complete Function/Class Binding and Signature Consistency:**  
    Class and function declarations provide all necessary scoping, visibility, and binding details to ensure instantiation and invocation exactly as automatic test harnesses require.

11. **Clear Side Effect and Mutability Specification:**  
    Any mutation of inputs or global state is unambiguously defined and consistent with expected semantics, so implementations reproduce side effects precisely.

12. **Tolerance for Non-Impactful Stylistic or Notational Variations:**  
    Variations in naming, formatting, or superficial language-agnostic style differences that do not affect semantics or completeness are acceptable and must not affect your decision.

**Important:** If there is *any* doubt—ambiguity, missing detail, inconsistency, partial coverage, unclear interface, or possible logical gap—that could cause *some* faithful implementations derived from the pseudocode to fail any valid unit test, output **0**. Do **not** guess or infer unstated information. Your decision must be fully justified by the pseudocode alone.

---

**Summary:** For each input pseudocode, output a single digit — **1** if and only if *all* the above criteria are met guaranteeing 100% reproducible passing of unit tests; otherwise output **0**. Provide no other text, explanation, or symbols. Outputs must be in direct input order.
