Given a standalone pseudocode describing a complete function or method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, your task is to determine with absolute certainty whether this pseudocode is **fully reproducible**—meaning that any direct, faithful implementation derived from this pseudocode alone will pass **all** valid unit tests for the problem without exception.

You must output exactly one digit per input pseudocode: **1** if and only if the pseudocode guarantees reproducibility under the strict conditions below; otherwise, output **0**. Provide no explanations, comments, or extra text. Outputs must correspond exactly in order to the pseudocodes given.

To decide with absolute rigor, confirm ALL of the following criteria are met **explicitly and unambiguously**:

1. **Complete Problem Specification**: The pseudocode precisely defines the problem’s input domain(s), types, formats, output expectations, and all necessary invariants, without reliance on implicit knowledge or outside context.

2. **Exact and Fully Declared Interface**: The function/method signature (name, parameters including names and types, return type, and enclosing scope) is explicitly given and matches the problem’s requirements verbatim, with no ambiguity or omissions.

3. **Deterministic, Full Algorithmic Detail**: Every step of the algorithm is described without gaps, including all control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion), initialization, updates, termination, and intermediate computations. Boundary conditions, base cases, and invariants must be clearly addressed.

4. **Explicit, Exhaustive Edge Case Handling**: All edge cases, special inputs, and error conditions are either directly handled or logically impossible. No input scenarios should cause undefined, partial, or ambiguous behavior.

5. **Precise, Unambiguous Operations**: Each operation (arithmetic, indexing, data mutations) is clearly defined with exact semantics and no shorthand or vague references. Variable usage is consistent and clear, with no symbolic or implicit meaning left to interpretation.

6. **Complete Structural Implementability**: The pseudocode is presented at a level of detail sufficient to be transcribed directly to syntactically correct executable code in a standard language, requiring no assumptions, guessing, or unspecified scaffolding.

7. **Self-Contained and Independent**: There are no external or hidden dependencies such as unstated helper routines, libraries, or resources. All logic and components needed for correctness are included or fully described.

8. **Consistent Mutability and Side Effects**: Any mutation of inputs or state and any side effects are explicitly described and conform strictly to the problem requirements, ensuring faithful reproduction in implementation.

9. **Full Namespace and Binding Clarity**: The pseudocode unambiguously includes all necessary declarations (class definitions, method accessibility, scope) so it can be instantiated and invoked exactly as intended.

10. **Logical Coherence and No Conflicts**: The flow of data and control is internally consistent without contradictions, omissions, or conflicting statements; all variables and states are coherently managed.

11. **Strict Adherence to Constraints and Rules**: All problem-specific constraints (bounds, ordering, limits) are explicitly enforced or guaranteed by the pseudocode logic.

12. **Tolerance for Style and Notation Variations**: Differences in naming, formatting, or language-agnostic style are acceptable only if they do not affect clarity, completeness, or correctness.

**If you identify any uncertainty, ambiguity, missing detail, logic gap, interface mismatch, incomplete coverage, external dependency, or possible failure scenario that could cause some faithful implementations derived from this pseudocode to fail any unit test, output 0.** Do not guess or assume unstated information. When in doubt, conservatively output 0.

Only output one digit (1 or 0) per input, in the exact input order, without any additional text or formatting.
