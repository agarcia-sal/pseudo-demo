Given a pseudocode specification describing a function or class method intended as a definitive, standalone solution to a well-defined programming task, produce a single output digit:

- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is perfectly reproducible, meaning:
  - Any direct, faithful, and unambiguous implementation derived *solely* from this pseudocode will pass **all** correct and relevant unit tests for the problem without exception.
- Output **0** otherwise.

No explanations, justifications, extra text, or formatting. Outputs must correspond positionally and strictly to each pseudocode input in sequence.

To determine reproducibility, rigorously validate EVERY requirement below:

1. **Complete Problem Specification Without Assumptions:**  
   The pseudocode provides or unambiguously implies the problem's full input domain(s), output types and formats, and all necessary constraints or invariants without requiring external knowledge, assumptions, or context.

2. **Precise and Self-Contained Interface Declaration:**  
   The function/method signature—including parameter names, types, return type, and scope (class/module)—is explicit, complete, and matches problem expectations exactly.

3. **Explicit and Unambiguous Algorithmic Logic:**  
   All control flow (loops, recursion, conditionals), data initialization, updates, and termination criteria are fully specified and clear. Every boundary, edge case, loop invariant, and recursive base and induction case is addressed without gaps or ambiguity.

4. **Thorough Edge Case and Error Handling:**  
   All special cases, corner inputs, and error states are explicitly handled or logically guaranteed by the algorithm. There must be no inputs that can cause undefined, partial, or ambiguous behavior.

5. **Clear and Precisely Defined Operations:**  
   Operations (arithmetic, indexing, string and data structure manipulation) have exact semantics and meaning. Avoid ambiguous notation, shorthand, or symbolic references that require external interpretation.

6. **Logical Consistency, No Contradictions or Omissions:**  
   The pseudocode must exhibit consistent, non-conflicting statements and a well-ordered, coherent flow. There should be no missing steps or "holes" in the logic.

7. **Sufficiently Complete and Structured for Direct Implementation:**  
   The pseudocode contains all necessary detail enabling a translation to syntactically correct, executable code in a standard programming language without guessing or adding unstated scaffolding.

8. **Explicit Enforcement of Problem Constraints / Domain Rules:**  
   Any requirements on input validity, size limits, ordering, or other problem-specific rules are explicitly enforced or guaranteed.

9. **Fully Self-Contained Specification:**  
   The pseudocode must not depend on unstated helper methods, external libraries, non-described resources, or implied steps. Everything essential for correctness is present or fully described.

10. **Consistent and Correct Function or Class Context:**  
    All necessary declarations for correct namespace binding, method visibility, and instantiation (e.g., class definitions, method scope) are included to ensure the pseudocode can be invoked and tested as intended.

11. **Unambiguous Description of Mutability and Side Effects:**  
    All mutations to inputs or global state, side effects, or state dependencies are fully specified and consistent with problem constraints.

12. **Robustness to Notational Styles and Naming Variants:**  
    Variations in naming, formatting, or language-agnostic stylistic differences are acceptable as long as they do not introduce uncertainty or gaps.

**IMPORTANT:** If there is *any* uncertainty, incompleteness, missing detail, ambiguity, logical gap, or partial coverage that might cause some faithful implementation from this pseudocode to fail any valid unit test, output **0**. Do *not* guess or fill in missing information.

Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) per pseudocode input in the order received, with no additional text or formatting.
