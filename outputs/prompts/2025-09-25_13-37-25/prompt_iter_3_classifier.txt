Given the pseudocode input, determine *with absolute certainty and zero ambiguity* whether the pseudocode is **strictly complete, fully detailed, and logically precise** so that any correct implementation derived *only* from it would consistently pass *every possible unit test* for the described problem.

To decide, verify all the following without exception:

1. The pseudocode defines all inputs, outputs, and any intermediate data structures clearly and unambiguously.
2. Every step, including loops, conditionals, recursion, function/method calls, and return statements, is fully described without omissions.
3. Edge cases, special cases, and constraints are explicitly or implicitly covered by the logic.
4. The pseudocode syntax and structure are coherent and represent a stand-alone function/method or class suitable for direct translation to working code that compiles and runs.
5. There are no contradictions, undefined behaviors, or gaps that could lead to implementation ambiguity or failure in any unit test.
6. Abstract or vague descriptions that would allow multiple interpretations invalidating reproducibility are considered *not reproducible*.
7. Logical correctness and completeness take precedence over cosmetic or stylistic pseudocode details.
8. The pseudocode includes the function or method signature (name and parameters) explicitly or implicitly sufficient to identify its interface.
9. Partial, incomplete, or pseudo snippets that require additional assumptions or outside knowledge are *not* reproducible.

**Output exactly one digit per pseudocode input:**  
- Output **1** if the pseudocode meets *all* of the above criteria perfectly and guarantees passing *all* unit tests.  
- Output **0** otherwise.

Output *only* the digit(s) corresponding to the pseudocode(s) in their input order. Do not output any explanations, formatting, or additional text.
