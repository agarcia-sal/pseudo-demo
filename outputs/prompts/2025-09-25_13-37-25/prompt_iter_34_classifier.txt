Given a pseudocode description of a complete function or class method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, your task is to determine with absolute certainty whether this pseudocode is fully reproducible—meaning that *any* direct, faithful implementation derived solely and unambiguously from it will pass **all** valid unit tests relevant to the problem, without fail.

You must respond strictly with a single digit — **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** of the criteria below, or **0** otherwise. Provide no explanations, comments, or additional text. The outputs must be in the same order as the pseudocodes are given.

To confidently decide, verify all of the following conditions rigorously:

1. **Complete and Explicit Problem Definition:**  
   The pseudocode clearly specifies or unambiguously implies the problem’s input domain(s), output expectations (type and format), and all required invariants or constraints without relying on external context or assumptions.

2. **Fully Specified Interface and Signature:**  
   The function or method signature is explicit and self-contained, fully stating input parameter names and types, return type, and encapsulation context (class or module scope). The interface matches the problem requirements exactly.

3. **Deterministic and Exhaustive Logic Specification:**  
   All algorithmic steps, including control flow constructs (loops, recursion, conditionals), data initializations, updates, and termination conditions, are described completely and unambiguously. Boundary conditions, loop invariants, and recursive base/inductive cases are explicitly handled without gaps.

4. **Explicit Edge Case and Exceptional Handling:**  
   All relevant edge cases, special input scenarios, and error conditions are addressed explicitly or logically guaranteed by the described algorithm. No inputs can cause undefined, partial, or ambiguous behavior.

5. **Unambiguous Instructions and Operations:**  
   Each operation (arithmetic, indexing, string manipulation, data structure modification) is specified with precise semantics. Avoid shorthand notations, ambiguous variable references, or symbolic shorthand that require interpretation beyond plain reading.

6. **Logical Coherence and Internal Consistency:**  
   There are no conflicting statements, missing steps, or logical omissions. The flow of data and control must be consistent and sequentially coherent; necessary intermediate computations or data structure states must be accounted for.

7. **Structural Completeness and Implementability:**  
   The pseudocode is sufficiently structured and complete so that it can be translated directly into syntactically correct, executable source code in a conventional programming language without any guessing, assumptions, or added scaffolding.

8. **Explicit Enforcement of Constraints and Domain Rules:**  
   Any problem-specific rules, limitations, or invariants critical for correctness (e.g., input bounds, resource limits, ordering constraints) are expressly enforced or guaranteed by the logic.

9. **Self-Containment — No External Dependencies:**  
   The pseudocode must be a self-sufficient specification: it cannot depend on unstated helper routines, unavailable libraries, external resources, or omitted steps. Every part crucial to correctness must be included or fully described.

10. **Tolerance to Notational and Stylistic Variations:**  
    Variations in variable/function naming, formatting, or permissible language-agnostic style differences that do *not* affect logical completeness or correctness are acceptable and must not cause rejection.

11. **Presence and Correct Use of Function or Class Context:**  
    The pseudocode includes all necessary declarations to ensure correct binding, accessibility, and namespace resolution (e.g., class definitions, method visibility) so the code can be instantiated and invoked as intended by automated tests.

12. **No Ambiguity Regarding Mutability and Side Effects:**  
    Any modification of input data structures or use of mutable state must be clearly defined and consistent with problem specifications; side effects must be well-detailed to guarantee faithful reproduction in real code.

**Critical:** If you identify *any* uncertainty, incompleteness, ambiguity, logical gap, missing interface detail, or partial coverage that could lead to some faithful implementations derived from the pseudocode failing one or more unit tests, output **0**. Do *not* guess or assume missing information. The default conservative answer is zero unless fully confident.

Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) for each pseudocode input, in the order provided, and nothing else.
