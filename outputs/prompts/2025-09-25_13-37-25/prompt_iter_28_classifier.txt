Given a pseudocode snippet describing a complete function or class method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, determine **with absolute certainty** whether this pseudocode is *fully reproducible*: that is, **any** direct, faithful implementation derived solely and unambiguously from it will pass *all* valid unit tests for the problem without exception.

Your answer must be exactly one digit, **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** these conditions, **0** otherwise. Produce no explanations, no extra text, no formatting, and output values strictly in the order pseudocodes are given.

Evaluate the pseudocode against all these comprehensive criteria:

1. **Clear and Complete Problem Context:**  
   The problem’s inputs, outputs (types, formats), constraints, invariants, and expected behaviors are unambiguously and exhaustively specified or implicit within the pseudocode alone, without requiring assumptions or external knowledge.

2. **Explicit and Correct Signature and Scope:**  
   The function/method signature clearly states all input parameters with precise naming and types, return type, and the correct class/module context so the code is immediately integrable for testing.

3. **Exhaustive Algorithmic Detailing:**  
   The pseudocode fully details all computations and control flows—including all loop/recursion entry, exit conditions, boundary cases, and state updates—without gaps, implicitly ambiguous steps, or placeholders.

4. **Definitive Edge Case and Error Handling:**  
   All meaningful special cases, edge inputs (empty, minimum, maximum, malformed), and error states are handled explicitly or guaranteed prevented, ensuring no undefined, partial, or ambiguous runtime behavior.

5. **Unambiguous Instruction Set:**  
   Every operation—including data access, mutations, arithmetic, indexing, and control commands—is described with exact semantics and no reliance on symbolic shorthand or vague abstractions needing interpretation.

6. **Logical and Structural Coherence:**  
   The flow of data and control is consistent, complete, and logically sound; there are no conflicts, missing steps, or contradictions; intermediate states and dependencies are accounted for correctly.

7. **Direct Implementability:**  
   The pseudocode can be translated to syntactically valid, executable code in a mainstream programming language *without* guesswork, added scaffolding, or assumptions about external definitions or runtime environment.

8. **Explicit Enforcement of All Problem Constraints:**  
   Input domain restrictions, bounds, ordering, size, resource limits, and other domain-specific invariants critical for correctness are explicitly checked or logically ensured by the code.

9. **No Hidden or External Dependencies:**  
   The pseudocode is fully self-contained—there are no calls to unspecified helper routines, undefined external libraries, or omitted steps critical for correctness.

10. **Clear Mutability and Side Effect Semantics:**  
    Mutations to inputs or global state are clearly described and consistent with problem requirements; side effects are fully specified to enable faithful reproduction.

11. **Complete Class or Namespace Context:**  
    Where applicable, class definitions, method visibility, and namespace information are present and correct, enabling automatic test harnesses to instantiate and invoke the implementation.

12. **Robust to Acceptable Stylistic Variations:**  
    Variations in naming, whitespace, formatting, or non-semantic style differences do not affect assessment; only semantic completeness and correctness matter.

**IMPORTANT:** If *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, logical flaw, missing interface detail, or risk of partial test failure exists, output **0**. Do *not* guess or infer missing details. Only output **1** when absolutely certain of full reproducibility.

Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) per pseudocode input, preserving input order, and nothing else.
