Given the provided pseudocode, determine *strictly and definitively* whether it is **fully specification-complete and unambiguous**, such that an accurate implementation following this pseudocode alone would pass *all possible unit tests* for that problem.

**Key criteria to consider:**
- All required inputs, outputs, and intermediate states are explicitly defined.
- All necessary computational steps, conditions, loops, and function calls are clearly described and logically consistent.
- There are no missing cases, contradictions, or undefined behaviors.
- The pseudocode corresponds unambiguously to a function or method with all needed signature elements and is syntactically and structurally coherent.
- The pseudocode is written as a full, self-contained algorithm or method suitable for implementation, including function/class definitions if relevant.
- Cosmetic or syntactic variations do not affect reproducibility—only completeness and correctness do.
- Near-misses with subtle missing details or ambiguity that would cause a failure in unit tests must be considered *not* reproducible.

**Output only a single digit:**
- Output **1** if the pseudocode meets all of the above and would pass all valid unit tests.
- Output **0** otherwise.

Do not output any additional text, explanation, or formatting—only output the digits `1` or `0` in the exact order of input pseudocodes.
