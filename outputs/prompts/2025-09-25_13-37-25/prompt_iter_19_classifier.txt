Given a pseudocode specification of a function or class method designed to solve a clearly delineated programming problem, your sole task is to determine if this pseudocode is *completely reproducible*—meaning that **every** direct, literal, faithful implementation derived exclusively and unambiguously from it will pass **all** relevant unit tests for the stated problem without exception.

Output exactly one digit for each pseudocode input, in the order given:  
- **1** if and only if the pseudocode satisfies *all* the criteria below, guaranteeing full test passing compliance with zero ambiguity or omission,  
- **0** otherwise.

No explanations, comments, text, or formatting—only the digits 1 or 0 strictly in sequence.

To assign 1, this pseudocode must fulfill *all* these rigorous conditions simultaneously and unconditionally:

1. **Explicit Problem Context and Requirements:**  
   The pseudocode self-contains or clearly articulates all problem input domains, output formats, functional goals, and correctness constraints explicitly or via unambiguous implication. No implicit or presumed knowledge external to the pseudocode is necessary.

2. **Complete and Correct Interface Declaration:**  
   The function or method signature (including class and access context if present) is precisely defined, with all parameter names and types provided, a specified return type, and conformance to required calling conventions matching problem demands.

3. **Deterministic and Exhaustive Algorithmic Description:**  
   The pseudocode fully specifies control flows, initializations, updates, and termination logic, covering all paths, branches, loop boundaries, and recursive cases. Nothing important is left vague or partially described.

4. **Comprehensive Edge, Boundary, and Error Handling:**  
   All relevant edge cases, boundary conditions, invalid or special inputs, exceptions, and error-prone scenarios are clearly handled or logically impossible by construction of the pseudocode’s logic.

5. **Unambiguous and Precise Instruction Semantics:**  
   Every operation — arithmetic, indexing, data structure manipulation, string handling, or other computation — is expressed in plain, explicit, non-elliptical terms with clear semantics. No shorthand requiring inference or interpretation beyond literal reading.

6. **Logical Consistency Without Contradictions or Omissions:**  
   The pseudocode contains no conflicting statements, missing intermediate steps, or logical gaps. Data flow and control are internally coherent and sequentially complete.

7. **Complete Structural Implementability:**  
   The pseudocode can be *directly* translated into correct, executable code in a standard procedural or object-oriented language *without requiring guessing, supplementation, or external scaffolding.*

8. **Explicit Enforcement or Guarantee of Critical Problem Constraints:**  
   Any domain or problem-specific constraints—input bounds, invariants, performance limits, ordering guarantees, or mutation rules—are directly enforced or guaranteed by the logic.

9. **Fully Self-Contained Specification:**  
   The pseudocode includes or fully defines all components and helpers essential for correctness. No reliance on unstated external functions, hidden dependencies, or omitted steps.

10. **Correct and Clear Scope and Binding Context:**  
    Includes all necessary declarations for function/method encapsulation, class membership, visibility, and namespace, such that the pseudocode can be instantiated and invoked as intended.

11. **Explicit and Well-Defined Mutability and Side Effect Management:**  
    Any mutation of inputs or internal state and related side effects are explicitly declared or clearly implied consistent with specifications, ensuring straightforward faithful reproduction in code.

12. **Robustness to Variable Naming and Styling Variations:**  
    Variations in naming, formatting, or stylistic presentation that do not reduce formal completeness or correctness do *not* invalidate reproducibility.

**Critical:** If you detect *any* uncertainty, ambiguity, incompleteness, missing interface detail, logical gap, or partial scenario coverage that could cause **some** faithful implementations derived from the pseudocode to *fail* one or more unit tests, output **0**. Do *not* guess or infer missing information. Default to **0** unless absolute, unqualified confidence in full reproducibility.

Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) per pseudocode in the order received, nothing else.
