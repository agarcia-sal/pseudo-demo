Given a pseudocode input describing a complete function or class method meant to solve a well-defined programming problem, your task is to precisely determine if this pseudocode is fully reproducible—that is, if *any* direct, faithful implementation derived strictly and unambiguously from the provided pseudocode would pass **all** valid unit tests without exception.

You must respond with exactly one digit per pseudocode input: **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets *all* of the criteria below, otherwise **0**. Output no explanations, comments, or any other text. The outputs must appear in the exact order of the pseudocode inputs.

For each pseudocode, rigorously verify these aspects:

1. **Problem Definition and Scope:**  
   The pseudocode fully specifies or logically implies the input domain, output type and format, and all correctness criteria and constraints without external assumptions. The problem statement or expected behavior is clearly evident from the pseudocode alone.

2. **Explicit and Correct Interface:**  
   The function/method signature, including parameter names, types, return type, and context (class/module), is clearly defined and matches problem requirements. The interface allows unambiguous invocation consistent with tests.

3. **Complete and Deterministic Algorithmic Logic:**  
   All control structures (loops, recursion, conditionals), data initializations, updates, terminations, and key invariants or loop-recursion bases are fully described without gaps, ensuring deterministic, total coverage of possible execution paths.

4. **Comprehensive Edge Case, Error, and Exception Handling:**  
   All edge cases, boundary conditions, and potential error inputs are explicitly handled or logically impossible to occur, ensuring no partial, undefined, or ambiguous behavior on *any* valid input.

5. **Unambiguous and Precise Operations:**  
   Every operation—arithmetic, indexing, data structure manipulation, string handling—is described with exact semantics without symbolic shortcuts, vague references, or implicit assumptions.

6. **Internal Logical Consistency and Soundness:**  
   The pseudocode is free from contradictions, omissions, and logical flaws. Data and control flow coherence is maintained across steps, and no required intermediate states or computations are missing.

7. **Sufficient Structural Completeness for Direct Translation:**  
   The pseudocode includes all components necessary for conversion to syntactically correct, executable code in a conventional language, needing no guessing, external scaffolding, or unstated helpers.

8. **Explicit Enforcement or Guarantee of Problem Constraints:**  
   All critical input/output constraints, resource bounds, and domain rules are directly enforced or logically guaranteed by the presented logic.

9. **Self-Containment without External Dependencies:**  
   All elements required for correctness are fully defined within the pseudocode. There is no reliance on unstated helper functions, hidden state, external libraries, or omitted steps.

10. **No Ambiguity in State Mutability and Side Effects:**  
    If the pseudocode modifies inputs or uses mutable state, these are clearly documented, deterministic, and consistent with the problem specification to ensure faithful reproduction.

11. **Correct and Complete Class or Module Context (if applicable):**  
    When pseudocode is intended for a class or object method, all relevant declarations, scope rules, and accessibility are properly defined, ensuring the code is instantiable and callable as expected by tests.

12. **Notation and Style Variations Allowed Only if They Do Not Compromise Correctness:**  
    Differences in naming, formatting, or idiomatic pseudocode conventions are acceptable only if they cause no ambiguity or incompleteness affecting the correct implementation.

**Strict requirement:** Output **0** if *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, logical gap, interface mismatch, missing case, or anything that could cause even a single faithful implementation to fail any valid unit test is found. Do **not** assume missing details or fill gaps by inference. When in doubt, default to **0**.

Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) for each pseudocode input, in the order given, and nothing else.
