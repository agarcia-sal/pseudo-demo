Given a pseudocode description of a complete function or class method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, your task is to determine without any doubt whether this pseudocode is fully reproducible. By reproducible, we mean that **every possible faithful, direct implementation derived solely and unambiguously from this pseudocode will pass all correct unit tests associated with the problem**. 

**Your output must be exactly one digit per input pseudocode, with no explanations or additional text:**  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode guarantees reproducibility under these criteria.  
- Output **0** otherwise.  
Outputs must be in the same order as the corresponding pseudocode inputs.

To determine reproducibility, rigorously verify the pseudocode meets **all** of the following without exception:

1. **Precise and Exhaustive Problem Specification:**  
   The pseudocode explicitly defines or fully implies input types, valid input ranges/domains, output types and formats, and all problem constraints and invariants required for correctness—no assumptions or external context needed.

2. **Complete, Unambiguous Interface Definition:**  
   The function/class signature fully specifies all inputs, outputs, parameter types/names, method visibility, and enclosing scope, matching problem requirements exactly. No missing or ambiguous interface elements.

3. **Deterministic, Total, and Well-Defined Algorithmic Logic:**  
   All computational steps—including control structures (loops, recursion, branches), data initialization and updates, and termination conditions—are fully described without logical gaps. Boundary cases, recursion bases, loop invariants, and termination criteria are explicit and complete.

4. **Explicit and Comprehensive Edge Case and Error Handling:**  
   All relevant edge cases and exceptional inputs must be either clearly handled or logically impossible given the specification. The pseudocode must ensure no runtime errors, undefined behaviors, or partial computations occur from any valid input.

5. **Unambiguous, Fully Specified Operations and Data Manipulations:**  
   Every operation (arithmetic, indexing, string/list manipulation, mutation of data structures, function calls) is described clearly with precise semantics—avoiding vague, shorthand, or context-dependent notation that requires interpretive guesswork.

6. **Full Logical Consistency and Coherent Control/Data Flow:**  
   No contradictory statements, missing steps, or unstated assumptions exist. The flow of data and control is sequentially consistent, with all intermediate computations and states accounted for to enable a faithful implementation.

7. **Sufficient Structural Detail for Direct Implementability:**  
   The provided pseudocode is sufficiently detailed and structured so that it can be translated straightforwardly into valid code in a standard programming language **without requiring assumptions, scaffolding, or filling in gaps**.

8. **Explicit Enforcement or Guarantee of All Constraints, Invariants, and Domain Rules:**  
   Any critical problem-specific constraints (such as input size limits, ordering constraints, resource bounds) must be verifiably enforced or logically ensured by the pseudocode’s logic.

9. **Complete Self-Containment with No Hidden Dependencies:**  
   The pseudocode must be stand-alone, containing all logic and helper routines essential for correctness. It must not rely on any external or unspecified routines, libraries, or assumptions.

10. **Clear Declaration and Correct Use of Class and Function Context:**  
    Necessary scope and accessibility details (class definitions, method encapsulation, visibility modifiers) are explicit so that implementations created from the pseudocode can be instantiated, called, and tested without ambiguity.

11. **Explicit Clarity on Mutability, Side Effects, and State Changes:**  
    If input data structures are mutated or global/mutable state is modified, the pseudocode must clearly specify what changes occur and when, ensuring these side effects align precisely with problem requirements.

12. **Tolerance for Cosmetic Variation Without Impact on Logical Completeness:**  
    Variations in naming conventions, formatting, or style are acceptable as long as they do not introduce ambiguity or logical incompleteness.

**Use the strictest standard: any uncertainty, ambiguity, incompleteness, missing specification, or logical gap that could cause faithful direct implementations to fail one or more unit tests mandates outputting 0. Your default answer should be 0 unless you are fully confident in all criteria.**
