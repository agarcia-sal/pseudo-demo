Given a pseudocode input describing a fully self-contained function or class method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, determine **with absolute certainty** if the pseudocode is *fully reproducible*. *Fully reproducible* means **every** direct implementation derived solely and unambiguously from this pseudocode will pass **all** valid unit tests for the problem without exception.

Your output must be exactly one digit per pseudocode input:  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode guarantees full reproducibility by strictly meeting *all* of the following criteria;  
- Output **0** otherwise.

To qualify as fully reproducible, the pseudocode must satisfy every aspect below without any ambiguity, omission, or need for external assumptions:

1. **Complete and Explicit Problem Specification**:  
   - Inputs, outputs, data types, and problem constraints are fully defined or logically and unambiguously inferable from the pseudocode itself.  
   - All intermediate states, data structures, and their invariants are clearly described or can be directly inferred without guesswork.

2. **Clear and Explicit Interface Declaration**:  
   - Function or method signature is fully specified with correct input parameter names and types, return type, and encapsulating scope (class or module) enabling direct implementation.  
   - No reliance on implicit or externally defined helpers, global states, or environment.

3. **Exhaustive and Deterministic Algorithmic Logic**:  
   - Control flow (loops, recursion, conditionals) is complete, including all initializations, boundary conditions, termination conditions, increments/decrements, recursive base and inductive cases explicitly detailed.  
   - All data operations (assignment, arithmetic, access, mutation) are precisely and unambiguously described, avoiding vague, shorthand, symbolic, or underspecified instructions.  
   - No implicit defaults, omitted states, or underspecified behavior.

4. **Comprehensive Edge Case and Special Scenario Handling**:  
   - All relevant edge cases stated or guaranteed by logic with no possibility of undefined, ambiguous, or partial handling for any valid input in the specified domain.

5. **Logical Consistency and Self-Containment**:  
   - No conflicting statements, logical contradictions, missing steps, or unclear transitions.  
   - The pseudocode forms a logically coherent whole, requiring no unstated code, implicit scaffolding, or external side effects.

6. **Syntactic and Structural Soundness for Direct Translation**:  
   - The pseudocode is well-structured and organized such that it can be directly and systematically translated into valid, executable code without adding or inferring any part.  
   - Recursive or iterative calls and data flows are clearly connected and terminable.

7. **Respect for Problem Constraints and Domain Integrity**:  
   - All problem-specific constraints are explicitly or implicitly enforced ensuring correctness and validity of outputs.

8. **No Dependence on Undeclared or Implicit Components**:  
   - No use of undefined helper functions, libraries, or hidden assumptions beyond what the pseudocode presents.

9. **Robustness Against Stylistic or Minor Variations**:  
   - Accept naming, formatting, comment styles, or syntactic idiosyncrasies that do not affect logical completeness or correctness.  
   - Reproducibility is a logical and structural property, not stylistic.

**If any uncertainty, ambiguity, partial specification, missing information, or potential for failing test cases exists, output 0.** This includes unclear control flows, unspecified interfaces, incomplete edge case coverage, or reliance on implicit behaviors.

**Important:**  
- Output exactly **one digit per pseudocode input**, in the exact order received.  
- Output only the digit **1** or **0** â€” no explanations, no comments, no extra text.  
- Your judgment must be definitive and conservative: if reproducibility is not *guaranteed* without doubt, output **0**.
