Given a pseudocode snippet describing a complete function or class method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, your task is to determine *definitively* whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**: that is, whether **any** direct and precise implementation, faithfully derived solely and unambiguously from this pseudocode, will pass **all** valid unit tests for the problem without any failure.

You must respond strictly with a single digit—**1** if and only if the pseudocode guarantees reproducibility by meeting **all** the following comprehensive criteria, or **0** otherwise. Output only the digits, in the exact order the pseudocodes are provided, with no explanations, clarifications, whitespace, or additional text.

---

To confidently and rigorously decide, verify the pseudocode against every one of these essential facets:

1. **Complete Problem and Context Clarity:**  
   - The problem scope, inputs (including types, formats, and domains), expected outputs (types, formats, and precise meaning), and all crucial constraints or invariants must be fully specified or unambiguously inferable from the pseudocode alone, without relying on external knowledge.  
   - The specification is self-contained, without placeholders, ellipses, or implicit assumptions.

2. **Explicit, Unambiguous Interface:**  
   - The pseudocode declares a clear function or method signature, including parameter names and types, return type, and any relevant class or module encapsulation head.  
   - Parameter and return conventions strictly match the problem’s requirements, leaving no ambiguity for implementation.

3. **Deterministic, Exhaustive Algorithmic Specification:**  
   - The pseudocode describes all control flow paths (loops, conditionals, recursion) explicitly, including start, iteration, termination conditions, and exit criteria.  
   - Data initializations, modifications, and updates are fully described; no assumptions or missing steps.  
   - Boundary cases, including empty inputs, minimum/maximum sizes, and special input values, are always explicitly handled or logically covered without gaps.

4. **Complete Edge Case & Exception Coverage:**  
   - All special cases, atypical inputs, and error conditions (e.g., empty data, invalid values, resource limits) are either explicitly addressed or logically impossible given the constraints.  
   - No possibility of undefined behavior, partial computations, or runtime failures due to pseudocode omission.

5. **Precise, Unambiguous Operations:**  
   - Each instruction’s semantics is fully defined, including data structure accesses, arithmetic, string manipulations, indexing, and state mutations.  
   - Avoid symbolic shorthand, vague references, or operations requiring interpretation beyond literal reading.

6. **Internal Logical Consistency & Cohesion:**  
   - No contradictions, logical gaps, or missing dependencies exist within the pseudocode; data and control flows make sense sequentially and causally.  
   - Intermediary computations, variables, and state transitions are fully accounted for.

7. **Direct Implementability & Structural Completeness:**  
   - The pseudocode is sufficiently concrete and comprehensive to be translated directly into correct, executable source code in a standard language *without any guesswork, assumptions, or extra scaffolding.*  
   - All helper functions or subroutines are fully defined or explicitly included.

8. **Explicit Enforcing of Constraints and Rules:**  
   - Any input domain constraints, algorithmic invariants, limits, or resource bounds are directly imposed or guaranteed by the pseudocode logic.

9. **Self-Containment—No External Undeclared Dependencies:**  
   - The pseudocode includes **all** necessary declarations, data structures, helper routines, and resources; it does not rely on unstated code, third-party libraries, external states, or omitted steps crucial for correctness.

10. **Clear, Complete Binding and Namespace Definition:**  
    - Class and method declarations specify fully qualified contexts ensuring unambiguous instantiation and invocation (e.g., appropriate scoping, visibility, method binding).  
    - There is no ambiguity about how to invoke the described code or access its components within automated test frameworks.

11. **Explicit Specification of Mutability and Side Effects:**  
    - Any changes to input parameters, global or mutable states, or side effects are clearly spelled out with deterministic behavior.  
    - The pseudocode explicitly states which data are mutable and how mutations propagate.

12. **Tolerance for Nomenclature and Style Variation:**  
    - Variations in naming conventions, formatting, or stylistic choice are acceptable if they do **not** impact logical clarity, completeness, or correctness.

---

**Critical:** If there exists *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, missing interface detail, logical gap, unclear binding, partial coverage, external dependency, or potential for some faithful implementations derived from the pseudocode to fail any unit test, you must output **0**. Do **not** guess, infer, or assume missing information. The default conservative output is **0** unless you are fully certain.

Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) per pseudocode input, strictly in the order given, and nothing else.
