Given a pseudocode input describing a complete implementation of a function or class method intended to solve a clearly defined programming problem, your task is to determine whether the pseudocode is **guaranteed fully reproducible**.  
*Fully reproducible* means that any direct, faithful implementation derived solely and exactly from this pseudocode (without adding, removing, or modifying logic beyond literal interpretation) will pass **100% of the valid unit tests** for that problem in any standard programming environment.

You must output exactly one digit per pseudocode input:
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode guarantees reproducibility by **strictly satisfying all the criteria below**.
- Output **0** otherwise.

To decide, thoroughly and systematically verify all of the following conditions:

1. **Complete Problem Definition and Context:**  
   The pseudocode explicitly or unambiguously defines input types, valid input ranges/domains, output types and formats, and any essential intermediate data structures or states needed for correctness or completeness of the solution.

2. **Explicit, Self-Contained Interface:**  
   A clear function or method signature is present, including explicit input parameter names and types, return type, and enclosing scope (class or module), so a direct code translation can be performed without guesswork.

3. **Deterministic, Detailed, and Exhaustive Algorithmic Logic:**  
   The pseudocode fully specifies all control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion) with precise initializations, termination criteria, and step increments or decrements. All algorithmic steps needed to solve the problem, including auxiliary procedures or helper functions, are fully declared inline or within the given code, with no unstated subroutines.

4. **Complete Edge Case and Boundary Condition Handling:**  
   All possible edge cases derived from the input domain and problem statement are explicitly addressed or logically guaranteed by the flow. No input or condition leads to undefined behavior, infinite loops, or uncaught exceptions.

5. **Unambiguous Operations and Syntax:**  
   Each operation is described clearly and precisely, without vague, symbolic, shorthand, or informal expressions that require interpretation or external knowledge. Data accesses, arithmetic, string and collection operations, and modifications are fully described.

6. **Logical Consistency and Completeness:**  
   No contradictory, missing, or implicit steps exist. All necessary conditions, updates, and returns are explicitly stated so that the logic can be followed exactly as-is. There is no reliance on external state, environment, or hidden assumptions.

7. **Structural and Syntactic Readiness for Direct Translation:**  
   The entire pseudocode is structurally sound and properly formatted to be translated line-by-line into valid, runnable code in a standard language without adding code scaffolding, missing method bindings, or guesswork about data types or control flow.

8. **Strict Fulfillment of Problem Constraints:**  
   Any problem-specific constraints (e.g., input size limits, performance requirements) and domain rules are fully incorporated and enforced to guarantee correctness and acceptance by the problemâ€™s specifications and tests.

9. **Self-Containment and Independence:**  
   The pseudocode contains no partial snippets or placeholders. It does not invoke external functions, libraries, or helpers that are not defined or described. It does not require supplemental code or definitions to be reproducible.

10. **Robustness to Presentation Variance:**  
    Minor stylistic or naming differences that do not affect functional correctness or completeness are acceptable and must not lead to rejection. Semantic clarity and completeness take precedence over style or formatting.

**Important:**  
If *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, missing information, unstated assumptions, or potential for implementation variants exist that could cause failures on any (even a single) unit test case, output **0**. Ambiguity includes unclear control flow, missing interface definitions, incomplete edge case coverage, or reliance on unclear operations.

After evaluating each pseudocode input fully according to the above, **output only one digit (1 or 0) per input, in the exact order the inputs are provided. Provide no explanations, comments, or additional text.**
