Given a pseudocode representing a complete function or class method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, your task is to output **1** if and only if this pseudocode is fully reproducible, meaning that *any* direct, faithful, and syntax-respecting implementation based solely and unambiguously on it will pass **all** valid unit tests for the problem without fail; otherwise output **0**.  

Respond strictly with a single digit (either **1** or **0**) for each pseudocode input, in the exact order given, and produce no additional text, explanation, formatting, or commentary.

To confidently decide that the pseudocode is reproducible (output **1**), the pseudocode must meet every one of the following rigorous criteria **without exception**:

1. **Problem Context and Specification Completeness:**  
   The problem domain, input types, output format, and expected behavior (including all constraints and invariants) are stated or unambiguously implied within the pseudocode itself. No critical information required for correct implementation or testing is missing or assumed.

2. **Explicit, Correct, and Complete Interface Definition:**  
   The function or method signature includes clear, exact input parameter names, types, and return type, aligned with the problem statement. The enclosing class or module context (if any) is stated, ensuring proper scoping and invocation. No ambiguity or omission of interface elements is allowed.

3. **Deterministic and Exhaustive Algorithmic Description:**  
   The pseudocode provides a fully detailed, step-by-step, and deterministic logical flow, covering every case, including loop/recursion entry, exit conditions, and all intermediate states. Boundary cases, base cases, and termination criteria are explicitly handled. The behavior for all valid inputs is fully defined.

4. **Comprehensive Edge Case and Exception Handling:**  
   All relevant edge cases, special inputs (empty, minimum/maximum values, duplicates, invalid formats if applicable), and error conditions are explicitly addressed or guaranteed by the algorithm. No input can trigger undefined, partial, or ambiguous behavior.

5. **Unambiguous and Precise Operations:**  
   Every operation—arithmetic, indexing, conditionals, data structure updates, string manipulations—is expressed with clear semantics, leaving no need for interpretation beyond direct transcription into code. Avoid any symbolic shortcuts, unexplained abbreviations, or unclear notations.

6. **Internal Logical Consistency and Coherence:**  
   The pseudocode contains no contradictions, omissions, or unclear transitions. Variables, parameters, and states evolve coherently throughout. Data flows and dependencies are clear and consistent, enabling faithful reproduction without guesswork.

7. **Structural and Implementational Completeness:**  
   The pseudocode is sufficiently structured—incorporating all necessary declarations, initializations, auxiliary functions or methods (fully described if invoked), and supporting constructs—to allow direct translation into a syntactically correct and runnable program in a mainstream programming language, without adding or inferring any missing parts.

8. **Explicit Constraint Enforcement:**  
   All problem-specific rules and constraints that affect correctness—such as input bounds, ordering requirements, data invariants, and resource limits—are either enforced explicitly or guaranteed by the logic, not left implicit or assumed.

9. **Stated or Fully Described Self-Containment:**  
   The pseudocode does not rely on any unstated helper functions, external libraries, global states, or additional resources not fully described within it. All components necessary for correct operation and correctness verification are included or documented.

10. **Correct Contextual Setup:**  
    The pseudocode’s class and function declarations, including method visibility and namespace placement as relevant, are fully specified and consistent with usage by automated test harnesses. No mismatch or missing declaration prevents proper instantiation or invocation.

11. **Clear Mutable State and Side Effect Specification:**  
    All mutations of inputs, auxiliary data structures, or states and their side effects are clearly identified and consistent with the intended behavior, enabling implementers to reproduce state changes exactly as expected.

12. **Resilience to Notational or Stylistic Variability:**  
    Differences in naming conventions, code formatting, or acceptable language-agnostic expression styles that do *not* impact correctness or completeness must be accepted and do not invalidate reproducibility.

**Critical:** If you detect *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, implicit assumption, logical gap, missing or incorrect interface element, or failure to handle some valid input or edge case fully, output **0**. Never guess or assume unstated facts. The default, conservative decision is zero unless there is full and confident certainty.

Output exactly one digit (**1** or **0**) per pseudocode input, in input order, and nothing else.
