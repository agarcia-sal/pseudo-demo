Given a pseudocode input that defines a complete function or class method aimed at solving a well-specified programming problem, determine definitively if it is fully reproducible. *Fully reproducible* means that any direct and faithful implementation derived solely from the pseudocode will pass **all** legitimate unit tests for the problem with no failures or exceptions.

Your output must be exactly one digit per pseudocode input:
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode guarantees reproducibility by satisfying *every* criterion listed below.
- Output **0** otherwise—if there is *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, or uncertainty that could cause an implementation to fail tests.

To assign your output, critically and systematically verify **all** of the following conditions, applying the strictest standards of clarity and completeness:

1. **Explicit and Comprehensive Problem Specification:**  
   The pseudocode fully specifies the problem context, including precise input domain(s), output type(s), intermediate states, and data structures with no reliance on implicit knowledge or unstated assumptions.

2. **Clear, Complete, and Self-Contained Interface Definition:**  
   The function or method signature is fully given, with explicit parameter names, types, return type, and class or module scope, enabling direct and unambiguous implementation.

3. **Exact and Exhaustive Control Flow and Logic Detailing:**  
   All algorithmic steps—loops (with correct bounds and termination conditions), conditionals, recursion (base and recursive cases), state mutations, and data transformations—are explicitly described without omission or vagueness. This includes initialization, updates, and increments/decrements.

4. **Comprehensive Edge Case and Boundary Condition Coverage:**  
   Every relevant edge case, input corner case, or special scenario dictated by problem requirements is either specifically handled or clearly guaranteed by the logic, leaving no inputs with undefined or ambiguous behavior.

5. **Unambiguous and Deterministic Operations:**  
   All operations, including arithmetic, comparisons, indexing, string and data manipulations, are described precisely in a way that excludes multiple interpretations or the need for guesswork. No shorthand notations, symbols, or informal expressions requiring external knowledge are permitted unless fully defined.

6. **Logical Consistency and Completeness:**  
   The pseudocode contains no contradictions, no missing steps, no implicit dependencies on external state or unstated defaults. Each computational step flows coherently into the next, ensuring correctness under every valid input.

7. **Syntactic and Structural Integrity for Direct Translation:**  
   The pseudocode is a fully formed, syntactically sound specification that can be directly translated into working code without adding, altering, or inferring any missing pieces, identifiers, or control structures.

8. **Strict Adherence to Problem Constraints, Rules, and Specifications:**  
   The pseudocode enforces all problem-imposed constraints (e.g., input size limits, value ranges) and domain-specific rules completely, thus guaranteeing correctness and avoiding test failures from constraint violations.

9. **Complete Self-Containment; No External Dependencies:**  
   The pseudocode is a standalone description that does not require any unstated helper functions, external libraries, frameworks, or omitted details. All necessary subroutines and logic are included or clearly defined inline.

10. **Robustness to Non-Essential Variations:**  
    Variations in naming conventions, formatting styles, code organization, or minor syntactic differences that do not affect the logic or correctness are acceptable and *must not* cause rejection.

**Important:**  
If *any* doubt exists about the sufficiency, clarity, or completeness of the pseudocode—if any portion can be interpreted in multiple ways, leaves implementation gaps, overlooks edge scenarios, lacks explicit interface declarations, or omits critical details—**output 0**. Only output 1 if you are absolutely certain the pseudocode guarantees passing all valid unit tests under all circumstances without exception.

After reading the pseudocode input, output exactly one digit—**1** or **0**—with no explanations, commentary, or extraneous text. The order of outputs must correspond exactly to the order of pseudocode inputs provided.
