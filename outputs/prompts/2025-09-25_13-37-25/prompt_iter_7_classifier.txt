Given a pseudocode input describing a complete function or class method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, your task is to determine with absolute certainty whether the pseudocode is fully reproducible. *Fully reproducible* means that any *direct* implementation derived solely and unambiguously from the pseudocode will pass **all** valid unit tests associated with the problem, without exception.

You must output exactly one digit per pseudocode input:
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode guarantees reproducibility by meeting **all** the conditions below.
- Output **0** otherwise.

To decide, rigorously verify that:

1. **Complete Problem Context:**  
   The problem, input domains, output specifications, and any intermediate state or data structures are fully and explicitly defined or can be unambiguously inferred without external assumptions.

2. **Explicit, Complete Interface:**  
   The pseudocode includes a clear, self-contained function or method signature specifying the exact input parameters (names and types), return type, and function/class scope that enables direct code translation.

3. **Exhaustive and Precise Logic Specification:**  
   Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) and data manipulations are spelled out completely and explicitly, including all boundary conditions, initializations, increments/decrements, loop termination criteria, and recursive base/inductive cases without omission or guesswork.

4. **Full Edge Case and Special Case Coverage:**  
   Handling of every relevant edge case and special input scenario defined by the problem is explicit or implicitly guaranteed by the logic; no inputs cause undefined, ambiguous, or incomplete behavior.

5. **Unambiguous Operations:**  
   Each operation (e.g., arithmetic, data access, string manipulation) is described without ambiguity, shorthand, vague terms, or symbolic notation requiring interpretation or assumptions beyond the pseudocode.

6. **Logical Consistency and Coherence:**  
   There are no logical contradictions, missing steps, or unclear transitions. All necessary steps for correctness are included—no implicit or externally required scaffolding, no reliance on unspecified defaults or side effects.

7. **Structural and Syntactic Completeness:**  
   The pseudocode is structurally sound and well-organized so that it can be directly translated into syntactically valid, executable code in a standard programming language without adding or guessing any part.

8. **Respect for Problem Constraints and Domain Rules:**  
   The pseudocode fully enforces any problem-specific constraints, conditions, and domain-specific rules critical to correctness.

9. **Self-Containment:**  
   Pseudocode is not a partial snippet or fragment; it does not rely on unstated helper functions, external libraries, or omitted steps—it is self-sufficient for implementation.

10. **Tolerant to Stylistic Variations:**  
    Variations in naming, formatting, or minor stylistic differences that do not impact logical completeness or correctness are allowed and should not cause rejection.

**Important:**  
If any uncertainty arises about whether the pseudocode covers all tests and cases entirely, or if any ambiguity, incompleteness, or vagueness exists that could cause some implementations derived from it to fail unit tests, output **0**. This includes missing definitions, unclear control flows, overlooked edge cases, or absent interface specifications.

After thorough and exhaustive evaluation, output exactly one digit per input pseudocode — **only** the digit 1 or 0 — in the order pseudocodes are given. Provide no explanations, comments, or additional text.
