Given the pseudocode of a complete function or method intended to solve a clear programming problem, your task is to determine with absolute confidence whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”that is, whether any faithful, direct implementation based solely on this pseudocode will pass **every** valid unit test for the problem.

Your output must be exactly one digit per pseudocode input:  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is guaranteed to pass all unit tests under any faithful translation, and  
- Output **0** otherwise.  

Produce no explanations, comments, or additional text. The outputs must strictly follow the input order.

To decide, rigorously verify that **all** the following hold without exception:

1. **Complete, Precise Problem and I/O Specification:**  
   - Input types, format, and valid value ranges are fully detailed or unambiguously implied.  
   - Output type, format, and correctness criteria are explicitly described.  
   - All problem constraints and invariants are explicitly encoded or logically ensured within the pseudocode.  
   - No hidden assumptions or reliance on external unspecified information.

2. **Clear, Unambiguous Function/Class Interface:**  
   - Signature includes all parameter names, types, return types, and context (class/module) exactly as required by the problem.  
   - No mismatch or omission of inputs/outputs, no hidden parameters.  

3. **Complete, Deterministic, and Explicit Algorithmic Logic:**  
   - Every step, control structure, state change, and termination condition is fully spelled out without ambiguity or gaps.  
   - Correct handling of all boundary conditions, corner cases, and recursive/iterative base cases.  
   - No partial, underspecified, or implied logic requiring guesswork.

4. **Explicit and Exhaustive Edge Case, Error, and Exception Handling:**  
   - All special input cases, error conditions, or exceptional states are fully addressed or logically impossible.  
   - No silent failures, undefined behavior, or reliance on external error-handling.

5. **Precise Variable Usage and Operation Semantics:**  
   - Variables and data structures have clear, unambiguous roles and lifetimes.  
   - Operations (arithmetic, indexing, string manipulation, data mutation) are explicitly and exactly described.  
   - No shorthand, symbolic, or informal notations that require interpretive assumptions.

6. **Logical and Structural Consistency:**  
   - No contradictions, missing statements, or incoherent data/control flows exist.  
   - All intermediate states and necessary auxiliary data explicitly tracked or computed.  
   - State mutations and side effects are clearly defined and consistent with problem requirements.

7. **Implementability Without Guesswork:**  
   - Pseudocode can be syntactically and semantically mapped to working source code in a standard programming language without adding assumptions or scaffolding.  
   - No reliance on unstated helper functions, libraries, external data, or omitted implementation details.

8. **Explicit Constraint Enforcement:**  
   - All input constraints, resource, ordering, or domain rules impacting correctness are explicitly enforced or guaranteed by the logic.  

9. **Self-Containment and Namespace Coherence:**  
   - All declarations, bindings, class or method contexts are included to ensure that the code can be instantiated, compiled, and invoked as intended.  
   - No external dependencies or undocumented environmental assumptions.

10. **Precise Mutation and Side Effect Specifications:**  
    - Any modifications to inputs or mutable shared state are explicitly detailed and consistent with correctness guarantees.  
    - Side effects must be fully reproducible and transparent.

11. **No Ambiguity in Naming or Stylistic Variations That Affect Correctness:**  
    - Variations in naming, formatting, or accepted language-agnostic style differences that do not introduce ambiguity or incompleteness are acceptable.

**Critical:** If you detect *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, contradiction, missing declaration, unresolved dependency, logical gap, or under-specification that could lead to some faithful implementations failing one or more unit tests, output **0**. Always default conservatively to 0 unless fully certain of reproducibility.

Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) per pseudocode input in the order received, and *nothing else*.
