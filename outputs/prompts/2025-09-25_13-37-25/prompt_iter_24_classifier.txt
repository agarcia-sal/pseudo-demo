Given a pseudocode representing a complete function or class method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, your task is to determine if this pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, meaning that any correct, direct, and faithful implementation derived solely based on this pseudocode will pass **all** relevant unit tests without exception.

**Output exactly one digit for each pseudocode input, in the order supplied:**
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is unambiguously and completely specified to guarantee reproducibility.
- Otherwise, output **0**.
Do **NOT** provide any explanations, comments, or additional text.

To decide reproducibility with absolute certainty, rigorously check ALL of the following aspects, rejecting even the slightest ambiguity, incompleteness, or missing detail:

1. **Problem Definition and Scope**  
   Inputs (types, valid ranges, formats), expected outputs (types, formats), and all problem-specific constraints or invariants are clearly and explicitly presented or logically and unambiguously implied within the pseudocode itself.

2. **Explicit, Complete Interface Specification**  
   The entire function/method signature is clearly declared, including parameter names, types, return type, and enclosing context (e.g., class, module). It aligns exactly with what tests expect; there are no omissions or discrepancies.

3. **Complete and Deterministic Algorithmic Logic**  
   Every computational step, including initialization, iteration, recursion, conditionals, updates, and termination conditions, is fully and precisely described. There are no gaps, implicit assumptions, or logical ambiguities. Boundary conditions, special cases, and base/recursive cases are exhaustively handled.

4. **Edge Case and Exception Handling**  
   All inputs outside typical ranges, empty inputs, minimal and maximal input sizes, and all exception or error cases are explicitly covered or logically prevented by the pseudocode. No inputs can provoke undefined, partial, or ambiguous behaviors.

5. **Unambiguous and Precise Operations**  
   Each operation—arithmetic, indexing, string manipulation, data structure mutation—is described with exact semantics. There is no vague notation, shorthand, or symbolic description requiring external interpretation or assumptions.

6. **Consistent, Logical, and Coherent Flow**  
   The data and control flows are internally consistent, well-ordered, and free from contradictions, omissions, or missing steps. All intermediate states and variables required to trace and implement the algorithm precisely exist and are accessible.

7. **Direct Implementability**  
   The pseudocode is sufficiently complete and self-contained to be translated into syntactically correct, executable code in any conventional programming language without guessing, inventing missing parts, or external scaffolding.

8. **Clear Enforcement of Constraints and Problem-Specific Rules**  
   All problem-specific limits, restrictions, invariants, or resource boundaries critical for correctness are explicitly enforced by the algorithm, or logically guaranteed by the pseudocode’s structure.

9. **Self-Sufficiency Without External Dependencies**  
   The pseudocode contains or fully defines all necessary steps, helper functions, data structures, or logic required for correctness. It does not rely on unstated routines, hidden libraries, unavailable external resources, or omitted sub-steps.

10. **Correct and Complete Class or Function Context**  
    The pseudocode includes all declarations, bindings, and surrounding context (class definitions, method visibility, namespace scope) needed to instantiate and invoke the function exactly as expected by unit tests.

11. **Explicit Handling of Side Effects and Mutability**  
    Any mutations to input data or use of stateful variables are clearly and precisely defined with respect to the specification, ensuring behavior can be faithfully reproduced without interpretation.

12. **Allowance for Non-Functional Variations**  
    Differences in variable/function naming, formatting, idiomatic stylings, or language-agnostic conventions that do not affect logical completeness or correctness are acceptable and should not cause rejection.

**IMPORTANT:**  
If you discern *any* missing detail, ambiguity, inconsistency, implicit assumption, partial coverage, or potential cause for test failures, output **0**. Never infer or assume information not strictly present and unambiguous in the pseudocode. The conservative default decision is **0** unless you are fully confident of reproducibility.

Output only the digits **1** or **0**, no other text or formatting, preserving pseudocode input order for multiple inputs.
