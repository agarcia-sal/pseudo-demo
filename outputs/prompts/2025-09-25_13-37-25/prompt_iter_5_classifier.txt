Given a pseudocode input describing a function or class method that aims to solve a programming problem, determine with *absolute certainty* and *zero ambiguity* whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, meaning that any correct implementation *directly and solely derived from it* will pass *every possible unit test* for the specified problem.

You must output:

- **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets *all* the conditions below perfectly and therefore guarantees reproducibility.
- **0** otherwise.

Check the pseudocode rigorously against all the following criteria:

1. The problem statement context, inputs, outputs, and all necessary intermediate state representations are clearly and completely defined or unambiguously inferable.

2. The pseudocode includes a complete, well-defined function or method interface (name, parameters, return type or output) sufficient for direct implementation.

3. All control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion) and data manipulations are exhaustively and precisely specified, covering *all* cases including initializations, increments/decrements, boundaries, and termination conditions without gaps.

4. The pseudocode explicitly or implicitly handles **all edge cases and special inputs** according to the problem scope, ensuring no undefined or ambiguous behavior remains.

5. No logical contradictions, ambiguous or vague expressions, or shorthand/symbolic notations that require interpretation or external assumptions exist.

6. The pseudocode is syntactically and structurally coherent; it can be translated into valid executable code without requiring additional scaffolding, guessing missing steps, or substituting unclear operations.

7. Descriptions of operations (e.g., array accesses, substring operations, mathematical formulas) are precise, unambiguous, and consistent throughout.

8. The pseudocode respects problem constraints and correctly integrates all domain-specific rules required for correctness and completeness.

9. Partial, fragmentary, or snippet-like pseudocodes that omit essential steps or rely on unstated assumptions do *not* qualify as reproducible.

10. Cosmetic variations or stylistic differences that do not affect logical completeness or correctness are accepted as reproducible if they satisfy all above criteria.

After thorough logical verification against all the above, **output exactly one digit:**
- **1** if you determine the pseudocode is fully reproducible and guarantees passing all unit tests.
- **0** otherwise.

Output *only* these digits for each pseudocode in the order they appear as inputs, without any explanations, comments, formatting, or additional text.
