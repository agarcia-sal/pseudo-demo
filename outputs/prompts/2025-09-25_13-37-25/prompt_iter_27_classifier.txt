Given a pseudocode snippet representing a complete function or method intended to solve a well-defined programming problem, determine if it is fully *reproducible*: that is, any faithful, direct, and unambiguous implementation derived solely from this pseudocode will pass **all** valid unit tests without exception.

**You must respond with exactly one digit per pseudocode input:**  
- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode unambiguously specifies a fully implementable, logically complete, and correct solution guaranteed to pass all tests.  
- Output **0** otherwise. Provide **no explanations, comments, or any additional text**. The outputs must strictly follow the input order.

To decide confidently, confirm *all* these essential conditions hold rigorously:

1. **Problem and Requirements Fully Defined:**  
   The pseudocode specifies or unambiguously implies all input types, domains, output types and formats, and all problem constraints, invariants, and success criteria, independent of external context.

2. **Explicit and Correct Signature and Context:**  
   The function or method signature is fully specified with parameter names, types, return type, and the necessary class or module context exactly matching the problem. The interface can be used directly in automated tests.

3. **Complete, Deterministic, and Unambiguous Algorithmic Logic:**  
   Every step, including initialization, control flow (loops, recursion, conditionals), termination, and updates, is detailed without gaps or ambiguities. Boundary and edge cases are exhaustively and explicitly handled.

4. **Explicit Handling or Guarantee of Edge Cases and Exceptions:**  
   All special cases, invalid inputs, and error scenarios are either explicitly addressed or logically impossible under the spec, guaranteeing no undefined or incomplete behaviors.

5. **Precise Operational Semantics:**  
   Each operation—arithmetic, indexing, data manipulation—is defined with exact meaning and no shorthand or ambiguous notation requiring interpretation beyond the text.

6. **Internal Logical Consistency and Coherence:**  
   No contradictions, missing steps, or logical flaws are present. The data flow and control flow align for all code paths, including intermediate states necessary for correctness.

7. **Structural Sufficiency for Direct Implementation:**  
   The pseudocode is complete and structured well enough to be converted to syntactically valid, executable source code without guessing, assumptions, or missing scaffolding.

8. **Explicit Constraint Enforcement or Logical Guarantees:**  
   All problem-specific constraints (such as input bounds, ordering, invariants) necessary for correctness are enforced or guaranteed by the logic directly within the pseudocode.

9. **Self-Containment Without External Dependencies:**  
   The pseudocode specifies all necessary details internally without requiring unspecified helper functions, external libraries, or resources.

10. **Clear and Correct Use of Class or Function Bindings:**  
    The pseudocode includes all class declarations, method visibilities, and contextual bindings required for correct instantiation and invocation as expected by tests.

11. **Unambiguous Specification of Side Effects and Mutability:**  
    All modifications to input or mutable state, including side effects, are clearly defined and consistent with the desired behavior, enabling faithful reproduction.

12. **Robustness to Safe Notational Variations:**  
    Variations in naming, formatting, and conventional pseudocode style that do not affect logic or completeness should not cause rejection.

**Critical Instruction:** If any ambiguity, missing detail, contradiction, logical gap, or incomplete coverage could cause some correct implementation faithful to this pseudocode to fail any unit test, output **0**. Never guess or assume missing information. The default conservative answer is **0** unless fully certain.

Output exactly one digit (1 or 0) per input pseudocode, in the order given, **with no other text or formatting**.
