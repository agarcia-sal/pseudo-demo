Given pseudocode describing a function or class method intended to solve a programming problem, determine **with perfect confidence and zero ambiguity** whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, meaning any direct and faithful implementation derived solely from it will pass **all** possible unit tests for that problem.

Output exactly one digit per input pseudocode:  
- **1** if and only if the pseudocode unconditionally guarantees passing every unit test (i.e., it is fully reproducible).  
- **0** otherwise.

To decide this, rigorously verify that the pseudocode meets *all* the following stringent criteria:

1. **Complete Problem Context**: The problem’s inputs, outputs, and any necessary internal states or variables are fully specified or unequivocally inferable from the pseudocode and standard conventions.

2. **Well-Defined Interface**: The function or method name, parameter list (with types or clear descriptions), and output/return type or behavior are explicitly provided, sufficient to implement directly.

3. **Exhaustive and Precise Logic**: Control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion), data updates, and all intermediate computations are described in full detail covering all iterations, branches, base cases, and termination conditions without ambiguity or omissions.

4. **Complete Edge Case Handling**: Every edge case, boundary input, special condition, or exceptional scenario within the problem’s domain is addressed explicitly or implicitly, ensuring no scenario is left undefined or ambiguous.

5. **Unambiguous, Consistent Operations**: All expressions, operations, and constructs (e.g., array indexing, string slicing, mathematical calculations, logical evaluations) are stated precisely and consistently, with no vague shorthand, symbolic placeholders, or external assumptions required.

6. **Logical and Structural Coherence**: The pseudocode is free from contradictions, logical errors, or gaps, and can be translated into valid executable code *without* needing any scaffolding, guesswork, or interpretation.

7. **Adherence to Problem Constraints and Rules**: The pseudocode respects all problem-specified constraints, data domains, and domain-specific rules essential for correctness.

8. **Self-Contained and Complete**: The pseudocode is a standalone solution rather than a fragment, snippet, or sketch reliant on unspecified prior knowledge, hidden context, or unstated assumptions.

9. **Syntactic Correctness and Clarity**: The pseudocode syntax and structure conform to normal pseudocode conventions clearly enough to be unambiguously implementable as code by a competent programmer.

10. **Stylistic Variations Allowed**: Cosmetic stylistic differences or alternative phrasing that do not affect completeness or correctness do not disqualify reproducibility.

Your analysis must be exhaustive and uncompromising. **If any of the above criteria are not fully and perfectly met, output 0. Otherwise, output 1.**

When multiple pseudocodes are presented as input, output their respective digits *in order*, concatenated without spaces, line breaks, or any other text.

**Output format:**  
A single line containing one digit (1 or 0) per input pseudocode, in input order, no extraneous text, no explanation.

Example:  
If the first pseudocode is reproducible and the second is not, output:  
`10`
