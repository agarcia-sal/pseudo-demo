Given the pseudocode of a single complete function or method designed to solve a specific programming problem, determine with absolute certainty if the pseudocode is fully reproducible—that is, *any* faithful and direct implementation derived strictly from it will pass **all** unit tests covering all valid inputs for the problem, without any failure.

Output **only a single digit**:  
- **1** if and only if the pseudocode guarantees reproducibility by meeting *all* the following comprehensive criteria simultaneously,  
- **0** otherwise.  

Output the results in the *exact* order the pseudocodes are provided. Do not output anything else—no explanations, comments, or whitespace.

**Key criteria to verify exhaustively:**

1. **Problem Specification Completeness:**  
   The pseudocode fully and explicitly defines the input types, valid input domain constraints, output type, and expected output format. All problem-specific invariants and constraints are stated or unambiguously implied so that no external assumptions or clarifications are needed.

2. **Precise and Complete Interface Definition:**  
   The function or method signature is fully self-contained, declaring all input parameters with names and types, return type, and correct encapsulation (e.g., class or module context) exactly matching problem requirements and callable as expected by tests.

3. **Deterministic, Exhaustive Control and Logic Flow:**  
   Every execution path, including base cases, recursion, loops, conditionals, and termination conditions, is clearly described without ambiguity or omission. All boundary and edge conditions are accounted for explicitly with no gaps.

4. **Explicit Handling of Edge Cases and Errors:**  
   All potential edge cases, special inputs, and error or exceptional scenarios are dealt with either by explicit handling or guaranteed by the structure and logic. The pseudocode never allows undefined, partial, or ambiguous behavior for any valid input.

5. **Unambiguous, Fully Specified Operations:**  
   Every variable reference, operation (arithmetic, indexing, data mutation), and data structure access is precisely and explicitly stated with clear semantics, avoiding shorthand, symbolic notation, or anything requiring interpretation beyond literal reading.

6. **Internal Consistency and Logical Soundness:**  
   There are no contradictions, missing steps, or logical lapses. Data flows and control steps are sequentially coherent and complete, ensuring intermediate states and dependencies are fully accounted for.

7. **Structural Completeness for Direct Implementability:**  
   The pseudocode is structurally sufficient to be translated into running code in a standard programming language without guessing or assumptions—no placeholders, omitted subroutines, or missing scaffolding remain.

8. **Enforcement and Verification of All Constraints:**  
   The code explicitly enforces or logically guarantees all problem domain rules, input bounds, ordering, uniqueness, size limitations, or similar constraints critical for correctness.

9. **Full Self-Containment Without External Dependencies:**  
   The pseudocode does not rely on any unstated helper functions, external libraries, or omitted setup steps. All logic needed to solve the problem correctly is contained within the provided code.

10. **Complete Declaration and Correct Use of Context:**  
    All necessary declarations (e.g., class definitions, method visibility, namespaces) are included to ensure the code is instantiable, correctly bound, and invocable as required by the test environment.

11. **Clear Specification of Mutability and Side Effects:**  
    Any mutations to inputs or use of global or mutable state is explicitly defined with clear, unambiguous semantics fully compatible with reproducible implementation.

12. **Tolerance to Superficial Style Variations:**  
    Differences in naming conventions, formatting, or syntactic style that do not affect the logical completeness or correctness must be accepted and do not justify rejection.

**IMPORTANT:**  
If you detect *any* uncertainty, ambiguity, missing detail, logical gap, incomplete interface, unstated dependency, or partial coverage that *could* lead to faithful implementations derived from the pseudocode failing any unit test, respond with **0**. Do not guess or assume missing information. The default conservative answer is **0** unless you are fully confident.

Output *exactly one character* per pseudocode input in order, nothing else.
