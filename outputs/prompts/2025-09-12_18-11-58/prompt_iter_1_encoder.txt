Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation in a compact, high-level style. The pseudocode must NOT include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the code steps. Prefer one-liners, abbreviations, and symbolic assignments. Follow the format below exactly, with step numbering and indentation where needed:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second timeout to deliver the best output possible.
