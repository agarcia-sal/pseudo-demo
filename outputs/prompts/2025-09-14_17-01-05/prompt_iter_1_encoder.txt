Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, compact high-level steps, one-liners, symbolic assignments, and abbreviations where suitable. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format strictly, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity under a 5-second generation limit. Use indentation to show structure but keep lines short and straightforward.
