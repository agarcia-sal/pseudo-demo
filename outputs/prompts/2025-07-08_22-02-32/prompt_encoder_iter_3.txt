Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations where appropriate. Write high-level, compact steps, preferably in one-liners. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow a numbered, step-by-step format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode is straightforward and understandable. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible output within this limit.
