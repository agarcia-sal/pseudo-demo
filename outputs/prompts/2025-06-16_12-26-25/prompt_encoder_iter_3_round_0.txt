Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that preserves all control flow elements, variable assignments, function calls, and loops in a consistent and simplified manner. Use mostly natural language phrasing combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it high-level and compact. Prefer single-line statements wherever possible to minimize line count, but maintain readability and the original code’s structural logic.

Omit comments, explanations, summaries, headers, and separator lines—output only the numbered pseudocode lines starting from 1, directly mirroring the program’s flow.

It is acceptable to omit less critical details, complex expressions, or intricate data structures if doing so helps produce a shorter pseudocode representation within a 5-second generation limit.

Use this numbering and formatting style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not add extra formatting or verbose wording; keep pseudocode straightforward, intuitive, and easy to follow.  
Output only the numbered steps of the pseudocode; no additional text.
