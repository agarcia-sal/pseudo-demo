Translate the input code into concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that strictly preserves its original structure and all control flows—assignments, conditionals, loops, and function calls. Use uniform, simple syntax that blends natural language and common symbolic notations to keep it compact and high-level. Prefer one-line statements when possible; omit lower-level details or intricate expressions if this helps reduce lines while maintaining clarity. Number each step sequentially starting from 1, exactly following this style and format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, titles, or separators. Do not restate the problem or add clarifications—only output the numbered pseudocode lines that precisely and succinctly capture the logic and flow of the original code. Use intuitive abbreviations but ensure readability. Keep the output minimal to fit within a 5-second generation limit.
