Translate the given code into concise, clear pseudocode that preserves the original structure and control flow—assignments, conditionals, loops, function calls—expressed uniformly and simply.  
Use mostly natural language phrasing combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep the pseudocode high-level and compact.  
Output one-line statements where possible, favoring brevity and readability; omit less critical details if it helps reduce lines.  
Number each line sequentially starting from 1, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid comments, explanations, summaries, headers, or separator lines.  
Do not include any sentences beyond the numbered pseudocode lines.  
Directly reflect the original program’s logic and flow in your output using intuitive, straightforward language.
