Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that faithfully preserves the original control flow—assignments, conditionals, loops, and function calls—in a uniform and consistent style. Use mostly natural language phrasing with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Strive for one-line statements wherever possible while maintaining readability. It is acceptable to omit detailed expressions or intricate data structure details to reduce length, aiming for minimal lines within a 5-second generation limit.

Number each step sequentially as shown:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, headers, or separator lines. Focus solely on the essential pseudocode that clearly and succinctly reflects the code logic and flow. Avoid verbose wording; prefer straightforward, intuitive language. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines, starting from 1, directly mirroring the original program structure.
