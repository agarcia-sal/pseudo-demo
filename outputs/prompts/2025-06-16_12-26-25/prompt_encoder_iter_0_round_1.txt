Translate the given code into concise, uniform pseudocode that strictly preserves the original structure and control flows (assignments, loops, conditionals, function calls) in a simple, readable, and compact high-level style. Use mostly natural language phrasing combined with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations. Favor one-liner statements and avoid explanatory text, comments, summaries, or notes. It is acceptable to omit some details to keep the pseudocode brief and within 5 seconds response time. Format the output steps as numbered lines, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include separator lines or headers. Output only the pseudocode itself, directly reflecting the original code’s control flow and logic clearly and succinctly.
