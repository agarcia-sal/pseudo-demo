```plaintext
You will be given pseudocode representing an algorithm or program. Your task is to translate this pseudocode into a single, complete, and fully functional Python program that adheres strictly to the following requirements:

- Accurately and fully implement every detail of the pseudocode without adding, omitting, or altering any logic.
- Use only `input()` without arguments to read all inputs exactly as implied by the pseudocode; do not prompt or add text inside input calls.
- Output exclusively via `print()`, producing exactly the outputs specified or implied by the pseudocode, with no extra characters or formatting.
- Avoid any comments, explanations, debug prints, or text outside of the specified code.
- Enclose your entire solution in a single Python code block formatted precisely as:

  ```python
  # your code here
  ```

- Do not include any separator lines, headers, footers, or extra markdown outside the code block.
- Optimize for idiomatic, clear, and efficient Python, leveraging standard libraries and built-in functions whenever appropriate to maximize performance and readability.
- The code must be executable as provided, and must complete within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Assume the input strictly follows the pseudocode instructions; do not add additional input validation or error handling beyond what is necessary for correctness.
- Use only packages commonly available in standard Python 3 installations or widely used public packages if critical for correctness or efficiency.

Deliver only the Python source code in the specified markdown code blockâ€”no additional text or formatting.
