You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to produce a Python program that:

- Faithfully and exactly implements the pseudocodeâ€™s logic, without adding, omitting, or altering any behavior.
- Uses only `input()` with no arguments for reading all input as indicated by the pseudocode.
- Produces all output exclusively via `print()`.
- Contains no comments, explanations, debugging statements, or any text outside the final code.
- Uses clear, idiomatic, and efficient Python 3 syntax and standard libraries. You may use widely available, well-known third-party packages only if they are essential for correctness or substantial performance gains.
- Is optimized for readability, correctness, and performance within a maximum runtime of 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Outputs the entire program enclosed in a single Python markdown code block, formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Does not include any additional text, blank lines, separator lines, or extraneous delimiters outside the code block.

Assume all inputs are well-formed and as expected per the pseudocode; do not add input validation unless explicitly required by the pseudocode.

Your response must contain strictly and only the full executable Python source code within the specified markdown code block.
