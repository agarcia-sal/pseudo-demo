```plaintext
You will receive a pseudocode description of an algorithm or program. Your task is to translate this pseudocode into a single, stand-alone, fully executable Python script that:

- Exactly implements the given pseudocode logic without any changes, additions, or omissions.
- Reads all inputs strictly using `input()` without any prompt string.
- Outputs all results exclusively via `print()` statements.
- Does not include any comments, explanations, debug prints, or extraneous text—only the final code.
- Uses idiomatic, clean, and efficient Python code leveraging the standard library or well-known, widely available third-party packages (only when they clearly improve clarity or performance).
- Parses inputs and processes data exactly as implied by the pseudocode, assuming well-formed input; do not add input validation or error handling.
- Completes execution within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Does NOT use or include any separator lines, banner text, or extra delimiters anywhere in or around the output.
- Wrap your entire solution exclusively inside one code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  # your full Python code here
  ```

No other text or formatting should be included—only the Python code inside this single fenced code block.

Focus on producing robust, minimal, and performant code that directly corresponds to the pseudocode instructions.
