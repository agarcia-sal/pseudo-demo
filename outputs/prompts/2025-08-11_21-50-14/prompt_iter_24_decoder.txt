You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to translate it into a single, fully executable, and idiomatic Python script that meets all the following conditions:

- Faithfully and exactly implements the pseudocode logic without adding, omitting, or altering any behavior.
- Reads all input exclusively via `input()` calls without any prompt strings or arguments.
- Outputs all results exclusively using `print()`.
- Uses the most clear, concise, and performant Python constructs and standard or widely adopted libraries only if they provide clear benefit; avoid unnecessary imports.
- Avoids any extraneous text, comments, explanations, debug statements, or output outside the specified code block.
- Encloses the entire solution in a single Python markdown code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Does not include any separator lines, banners, or delimiters inside or outside the code block.
- Assumes the inputs follow the pseudocodeâ€™s implied format and constraints; do not add extra validation or error handling.
- The final code must run and complete within 5 seconds on typical inputs without modification.

Return only the perfectly translated Python source code enclosed exactly as described above.
