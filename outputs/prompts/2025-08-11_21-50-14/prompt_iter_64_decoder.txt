```plaintext
You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Translate it into a single, complete, and fully functional Python script that strictly adheres to the following rules:

- Precisely implement the logic and flow of the pseudocode with no additions, omissions, or alterations.
- Use only `input()` without arguments for all input reading.
- Produce all output solely via `print()` statements.
- Enclose your entire solution in one uninterrupted Python code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Do not include any comments, explanations, debug prints, or extraneous textâ€”only the validated Python source code inside the code block.
- Avoid any separator lines, banner text, or extra delimiters inside or outside the code block.
- Employ the most idiomatic, clear, and efficient Python constructs and standard libraries; you may use widely known third-party libraries only when they significantly enhance clarity or performance.
- Structure input parsing and processing to handle typical, well-formed inputs as implicitly defined by the pseudocode; do not add explicit input validation or error handling.
- Ensure the complete code is executable as-is and completes within 5 seconds on standard inputs.

Deliver nothing except the final Python code enclosed strictly within the specified python markdown code block.
