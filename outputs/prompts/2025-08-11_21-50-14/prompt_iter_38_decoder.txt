```plaintext
You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Translate it into a Python program that:

- Faithfully and exactly implements the pseudocode logic without adding, omitting, or altering any behavior.
- Reads all input exclusively using zero-argument `input()` calls, no prompt strings.
- Produces all output exclusively via `print()`.
- Outputs only the Python source code enclosed in a single, uninterrupted Python markdown code block as follows:

```python
# your code here
```

- Includes no comments, explanations, debug output, or any text outside this code block.
- Uses idiomatic, clean, and efficient Python 3 code.
- Utilizes Python standard libraries by default; third-party libraries only if crucial for performance or clarity and widely available.
- Is fully self-contained and executable as-is.
- Completes execution within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Assumes inputs are well-formed as implied by the pseudocode; do not add input validation checks beyond that.
- Avoids any separator lines, banners, or extra delimiters.
- Strives for clarity, correctness, and optimal runtime performance.

Provide nothing but the final, exact Python source code enclosed in the specified Python markdown code block.
