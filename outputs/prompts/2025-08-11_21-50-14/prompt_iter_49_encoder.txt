Generate clear, concise pseudocode from the problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly natural language with symbolic operators and common abbreviations. Write each instruction as a short one-liner wherever possible, including loops and conditionals in the form `keyword condition: action`. Use simple keywords such as `let`, `read`, `set`, `for`, `if`, `while`, `print`, and `return`, placing the action immediately after the colon. Number lines starting at 1 exactly as shown:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Choose descriptive yet short variable names prioritizing readability without excessive abbreviation. Declare variables or types only if necessary for high-level clarity. Avoid multi-line blocks, indentation-only lines, blank lines, separator lines, comments, summaries, or explanations. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines strictly following this format. Do not use separator lines (e.g., '-----') or blank lines.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
	set min_i to i  
	for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
