Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, clean, efficient, and production-quality Python program. The code must:

- Handle input using only `input()` with no prompt strings.
- Produce the exact behavior implied by the pseudocode, including edge cases and constraints.
- Use only standard or commonly accepted Python libraries for performance and readability.
- Be optimized to run within 5 seconds for typical problem sizes.
- Include clear, concise variable names and structure for readability and maintainability.
- Enclose the entire code snippet in a single Python code block, formatted as ```python ... ```.
- Return only the Python codeâ€”no explanations, comments, or extra text.

Your goal is to maximize correctness, clarity, and runtime efficiency simultaneously.
