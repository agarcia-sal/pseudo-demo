You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program logic. Translate it into Python code that:

- Precisely implements the pseudocode without adding, omitting, or modifying any logic.
- Uses only `input()` with no arguments to read all inputs, and only `print()` for all outputs.
- Contains no comments, explanations, or any text outside the single Python code block.
- Produces a single minimal, clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python program leveraging standard libraries or widely available third-party libraries only when they significantly improve clarity or performance.
- Handles input/output exactly as implied by the pseudocode, assuming inputs are well-formed; do not add validation or prompts.
- Optimizes for readability, correctness, and runtime performance to run within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Outputs only one Python code block, formatted exactly as:

```python
<your complete Python code here>
```

No additional text, separators, markdown, or anything else outside the specified code block should be included. Your code must be fully executable as-is.
