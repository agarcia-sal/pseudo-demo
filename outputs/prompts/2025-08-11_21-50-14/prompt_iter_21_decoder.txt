You will receive pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to translate it into a single, concise, and idiomatic Python program that:

- Exactly implements the pseudocodeâ€™s logic with zero additions or omissions.
- Reads all input exclusively through `input()` with no arguments.
- Produces all output exclusively via `print()`.
- Includes no comments, explanations, debug info, or any text other than the final code.
- Outputs one uninterrupted Python code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Avoids any separator lines, extra delimiters, or text outside the code block.
- Uses optimal Python approaches and standard libraries (or widely available third-party libraries if critically beneficial) for clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Is fully executable as-is, finishing within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Assumes well-formed inputs as implied by the pseudocode; do not add input validation beyond that.

Provide nothing but the perfectly translated Python source code enclosed in the specified Python markdown code block.
