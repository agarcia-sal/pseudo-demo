You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to produce a complete, fully functional Python program that:

- Faithfully and exactly implements the pseudocode’s logic and behavior without adding, modifying, or omitting any functionality.
- Uses only `input()` without arguments to read all inputs.
- Uses only `print()` to output results exactly as required.
- Contains no comments, debugging statements, explanatory text, or any outputs other than the specified Python code.
- Outputs the entire program enclosed in a single Python code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Applies Python best practices rigorously, producing clean, readable, idiomatic, and optimized code.
- Leverages relevant standard libraries or well-known, widely available third-party packages to maximize correctness, efficiency, and clarity.
- Handles inputs and outputs robustly and efficiently to meet a runtime limit of 5 seconds on typical problem sizes.
- Does NOT include separator lines, extraneous delimiters, or any formatting outside the code block.
- Assumes the environment has Python 3.8+ with typical packages installed.

Respond only with the complete Python code block implementing the pseudocode—no additional explanations, disclaimers, or metadata.
