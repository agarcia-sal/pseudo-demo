You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to provide a direct, exact, and fully functional Python implementation that:

- Strictly follows the pseudocode logic without adding, omitting, or altering any behavior.
- Reads all input only via `input()` with no arguments.
- Produces all output only through `print()`.
- Uses the most idiomatic, concise, and efficient Python constructs and standard libraries, or widely accepted third-party libraries only if they offer clear, critical advantages.
- Generates a single, continuous Python code snippet that can run as-is without any setup, comments, explanations, prompts, debug prints, or external text.
- Encapsulates the entire code inside a single Python markdown code block exactly like this:

  ```python
  # your code here
  ```

- Includes no separator lines, extra delimiters, or text outside this code block.
- Assumes inputs follow the pseudocode specification exactly; do not add input validation or error handling beyond what the pseudocode implies.
- Completes execution within 5 seconds on typical inputs.

Provide only the perfectly translated Python source code enclosed exactly as specified.
