Generate clear and concise high-level pseudocode directly from the problem description, using mostly natural language with symbolic operators and common abbreviations. Express logic in compact, mostly one-line instructions preferring one-liner loops and conditionals with the syntax `keyword condition: action`. Use simple keywords like `let`, `read`, `set`, `for`, `if`, `while`, `print`, and `return` placing the action immediately after the colon. Number each output line starting from 1 exactly as:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Choose short but descriptive variable names prioritizing readability. Declare variables and types only when essential to convey key algorithm steps. Avoid multi-line blocks, indentation-only lines, blank or separator lines, comments, summaries, or explanations. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines following the exact specified format without extra text.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
	set min_i to i  
	for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
