You will be provided with pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to translate this pseudocode into a clean, concise, and fully functional Python program that strictly adheres to the following criteria:

- Precisely implement the pseudocode logic without any additions, removals, or deviations.
- Handle all inputs exclusively by calling `input()` with no arguments (e.g., no prompts or parameters).
- Produce all outputs exclusively using `print()`.
- Do not include any comments, explanations, debug statements, extra text, or output beyond the required code.
- Enclose the entire solution in a single, uninterrupted Python markdown code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Avoid any separator lines, headers, footers, or text outside the code block.
- Use idiomatic, efficient Python code leveraging the standard library and widely accepted third-party libraries only if they provide clear, critical benefits.
- Write Python that is immediately executable as-is and completes within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Assume inputs are well-formed and consistent with the pseudocode specification; do not add input validation unless explicitly required by the pseudocode.
- Optimize for clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiencyâ€”choose Python constructs and libraries that best serve these goals without sacrificing the exact steps and outcomes described in the pseudocode.

Deliver only the final Python source code strictly within the described markdown code block. Nothing else.
