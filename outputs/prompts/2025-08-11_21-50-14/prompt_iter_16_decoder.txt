You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to translate this pseudocode into a single, clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python program that:

- Precisely implements the given pseudocodeâ€™s logic and functionality with zero deviations or omissions.
- Uses `input()` without any arguments exactly as the sole means of reading all input.
- Uses `print()` exclusively for all output demands.
- Includes no comments, explanations, debug statements, extra text, or formatting beyond the code itself.
- Produces only one contiguous Python code snippet, enclosed within a single Python code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Avoids any separator lines, additional delimiters, or text outside the Python code block.
- Applies best Pythonic practices for clarity and efficiency, leveraging standard libraries or well-known third-party packages as needed for correctness and optimal performance.
- Is fully executable and finishes within 5 seconds on typical inputs, employing the most effective algorithms and data handling.
- Assumes inputs are well-formed according to the pseudocode; do not add input validation beyond what the pseudocode implies.

Your entire response must be the complete Python code only, contained within the specified Python markdown code block, with no additional text before, after, or inside the code block.
