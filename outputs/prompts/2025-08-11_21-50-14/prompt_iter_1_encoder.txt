Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Write pseudocode only—no purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations. Prefer one-liners and simple control structures. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode is clear and understandable, focusing solely on the algorithmic steps. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to return the best result within this limit.
