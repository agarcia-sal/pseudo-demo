Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, idiomatic, and well-structured Python code that prioritizes correctness, clarity, and efficiency within a 5-second runtime. Your code **must**:

- Use only `input()` for reading inputs (no prompt strings).
- Produce output using `print()` where needed.
- Not include any commentary, explanations, or extra text—only return the complete Python code.
- Enclose the entire Python code within a Python code block formatted as:  
  ```python  
  ...  
  ```  
- Avoid separator lines or extraneous formatting.
- Leverage any Python standard library or third-party packages as appropriate to achieve the most performant and clean solution.

Focus on delivering the best-quality, fully functional Python program that matches the pseudocode’s logic precisely and runs efficiently under the time constraint.
