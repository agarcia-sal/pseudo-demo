```plaintext
You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Translate it to a complete, ready-to-run Python script that meets all the following requirements exactly:

- Faithfully implement the pseudocode’s logic without adding, omitting, or altering behavior.
- Use only `input()` with no arguments for all input operations.
- Use only `print()` for all output operations.
- Do not include any comments, explanations, debug statements, prompts, or extraneous text—only pure executable code.
- Enclose the entire output strictly within a single Python markdown code block, formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Do not include any separator lines, extra delimiters, or any text before, after, or inside the code block except the code itself.
- Favor idiomatic, clean, and efficient Python using the standard library. You may utilize third-party libraries only if they offer clear, substantial benefits and are widely available.
- Ensure the code is optimized for correctness, readability, and performance and runs within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Assume input is well-formed as implied by the pseudocode; do not add input validation, error handling, or assumptions beyond what the pseudocode states.
- Where parsing or data handling is required, handle input formats exactly as described or naturally implied by the pseudocode.

Produce nothing but the Python source code enclosed in the specified Python markdown code block.
