You will be given pseudocode that describes an algorithm or program. Translate it into a complete, executable, and idiomatic Python program that:

- Exactly follows the pseudocode logic without any addition, omission, or deviation.
- Takes **all** inputs strictly via `input()` calls with no arguments.
- Produces **all** output exclusively through `print()` calls.
- Uses clear, concise, and efficient Python code, leveraging built-in and standard libraries when appropriate for correctness and performance.
- Contains no comments, explanations, or extra text â€” only the final source code.
- Encloses the entire solution in a single, uninterrupted Python code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Includes no separators, extra delimiters, or content outside the code block.
- Assumes inputs are well-formed as implied by the pseudocode; do not add input validation or error handling beyond what the pseudocode mandates.
- Completes execution within 5 seconds on typical inputs.

Provide only the requested Python source code within the specified code block, nothing else.
