```plaintext
You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Translate it into a complete, executable Python script that strictly follows these rules:

- The Python code must exactly implement the pseudocode logic without adding, omitting, or altering any behavior.
- All inputs must be read using plain input() calls with no prompt strings or arguments.
- All outputs must be produced exclusively via print().
- Use Pythonic, clear, and efficient constructs; leverage the Python standard library or widely accepted third-party packages *only if they directly improve clarity, correctness, or performance*.
- The script must be a standalone program that can run as-is and complete within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Assume inputs are well-formed as per the pseudocode; do not add extra input validation.
- Do not include any comments, explanations, debug statements, or additional text.
- Enclose your entire code strictly within a single Python markdown code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Do not include any extra text, separator lines, or anything outside this code block.

Focus on creating clean, idiomatic, and fully faithful Python translations that meet these criteria precisely.
