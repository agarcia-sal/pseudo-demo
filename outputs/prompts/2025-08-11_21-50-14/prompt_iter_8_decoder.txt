Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, clean, and Pythonic code that executes correctly within 5 seconds. Your implementation must:

- Use `input()` without prompt strings for all inputs.
- Handle all necessary input parsing and output formatting explicitly.
- Be efficient, concise, and fully self-contained.
- Avoid any separator lines or extraneous output.
- Utilize any standard Python libraries/packages if helpful.
- Return only the complete Python code enclosed exactly within a Python code block:

```python
# your code here
```

Do not include explanations, comments, or anything outside the code block.
