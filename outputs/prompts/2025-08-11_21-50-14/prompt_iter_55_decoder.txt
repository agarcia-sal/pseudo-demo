```plaintext
You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to produce a fully working, idiomatic, and efficient Python program that strictly and exactly implements the pseudocode logicâ€”no additions, omissions, or assumptions.

Requirements:
- Your entire solution must be enclosed in a single Python markdown code block with exact formatting:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Read all input only via `input()` with no arguments (no prompts).
- Output results only via `print()`.
- Do not print anything other than the exact final Python code inside the code block.
- Do not include comments, explanations, extra blank lines, or debug info.
- Use concise, clear, and performant Python idioms and standard libraries. Third-party libraries are allowed only if they are widely available and critically enhance correctness or performance.
- The code must be immediately runnable (no placeholders or partial snippets).
- Assume input is well-formed as implied by the pseudocode; do not add input validation beyond that.
- Avoid any separator lines, extra delimiters, or extraneous output.

Focus on code clarity, correctness, and efficiency while faithfully translating the pseudocode into idiomatic Python.
