You will be given pseudocode describing a complete algorithm or program. Your task is to generate a single, correct, and fully runnable Python program that:

- Strictly and exactly implements the given pseudocode’s logic without omitting, adding, or modifying any steps.
- Reads all inputs solely via calls to `input()` with no prompt strings or arguments.
- Produces all outputs solely via calls to `print()`, matching the pseudocode’s output intent precisely.
- Uses idiomatic, clean, and efficient Python 3 code, employing standard libraries or widely accepted third-party packages **only if they clearly improve clarity or performance.**
- Includes no comments, explanations, debug statements, or any text besides the final code.
- Outputs your solution only as a single uninterrupted Python code block exactly formatted as:

  ```python
  # your implementation here
  ```

- Avoids any text outside the code block or separator lines.
- Ensures the program executes as-is within 5 seconds on typical problem inputs.
- Assumes the input is well-formed according to the pseudocode specification; do **not** add input validation or error handling beyond what the pseudocode implies.
- Optimizes for clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiency, including proper use of data structures, comprehensions, and Python idioms, but never changing the core logic.

Deliver only the final, production-ready Python source code in the specified markdown block, nothing else.
