```plaintext
You are given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Translate it into a complete, correct, and optimal Python script that strictly follows these requirements:

- Implement the pseudocode's exact logic and control flow without any additions, removals, or modifications.
- Use only plain `input()` calls without arguments to read all input, preserving input order and format as implied by the pseudocode.
- Output all results exclusively with `print()` statements as dictated by the pseudocode.
- Use idiomatic, concise, and efficient Python, leveraging built-in libraries and standard packages as needed to produce clear, performant code; you may include widely used third-party libraries only if they offer clear, substantial benefits and are likely available.
- Assume inputs are well-formed and do not add any input validation or error handling beyond what's necessary for correctness.
- Deliver the entire solution enclosed in a single uninterrupted Python code block exactly formatted like:

  ```python
  # your code here
  ```

- Do not add any comments, explanations, debug prints, banners, extra delimiters, or additional text inside or outside the code block.
- Ensure your code runs as-is and completes within 5 seconds on typical inputs defined implicitly by the pseudocode.

Provide only the Python code inside the specified fenced code block, nothing else.
