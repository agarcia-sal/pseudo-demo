You will receive pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to produce a Python program that:

- Faithfully and exhaustively implements the provided pseudocode’s logic without any additions, omissions, or assumptions.
- Reads all input exclusively via `input()` calls without any arguments or prompts.
- Produces all output exclusively via `print()` calls.
- Uses idiomatic, concise, and optimal Python code leveraging built-in functions and standard libraries to maximize clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Contains no comments, explanations, debug statements, or any text other than the final code.
- Is complete and runnable as-is, respecting a runtime limit of 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Encloses the entire solution in a single Python code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  # your code here
  ```

- Contains no extra lines, delimiters, or text inside or outside the code block.
- Assumes inputs strictly follow the pseudocode’s implied format and constraints; do not implement input validation beyond that.
- Avoids unnecessary variable usage or overly verbose constructs; strive for clear but minimal code.
- May use any built-in or standard Python modules, or widely accepted third-party packages if critically beneficial and clearly justified by pseudocode.

Provide only the translated Python source code within the specified code block with zero extraneous content.
