You will receive pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Translate this pseudocode into an optimized, idiomatic, and fully working Python program that:

- Exactly implements the logic and functionality described in the pseudocode with no deviations.
- Uses only `input()` (without arguments) for all input reading.
- Uses `print()` for all required output.
- Contains no explanatory comments, debugging prints, or extra textâ€”output only the Python code.
- Encloses the entire code in a single Python code block formatted exactly as:
  ```python
  ...
  ```
- Does not include separator lines, extra delimiters, or formatting outside the code block.
- Employs Pythonic best practices and efficient techniques, including relevant standard libraries or well-known third-party packages, to maximize correctness, clarity, and performance.
- Completes execution within a 5-second runtime on typical inputs.

Your response must be only the complete Python code block implementing the pseudocode. No additional text or metadata should be included.
