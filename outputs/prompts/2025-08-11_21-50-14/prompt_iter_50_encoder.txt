Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the problem description using mostly natural language combined with symbolic operators and common abbreviations. Write each instruction as a short one-liner with no indentation or multi-line blocks. Express loops and conditionals using the form `keyword condition: action` on the same line. Use simple keywords such as `let`, `read`, `set`, `for`, `if`, `while`, `print`, and `return`, placing the action immediately after the colon. Number lines starting at 1 exactly as shown:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Choose clear and descriptive but brief variable names prioritizing readability without excessive abbreviation. Declare variables and types only if necessary for clarity at a high level. Avoid blank lines, comments, summaries, explanations, or separator lines (e.g., `-----`). Output only the numbered pseudocode lines strictly following this format.

Example of the expected style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
	set min_i to i  
	for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
