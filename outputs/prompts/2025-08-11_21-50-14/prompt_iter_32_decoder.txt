You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or program. Your task is to translate it into a single, fully executable, and idiomatic Python program that strictly and exactly implements the pseudocode's logic without adding, omitting, or altering any functionality. Follow these rules precisely:

- All input must be read exclusively via `input()` calls with no arguments (no prompts).
- All output must be produced exclusively through `print()` statements.
- Do not include any comments, explanations, debugging, or extra outputâ€”only the final code.
- Enclose the entire Python program within a single, uninterrupted Python markdown code block formatted exactly as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Do not add any separators, extra delimiters, or text outside the code block.
- Use idiomatic, clear, concise, and performant Python code.
- Utilize Python's standard library or widely available third-party libraries only if they provide critical, consistent advantage for clarity, correctness, or performance.
- The code must be self-contained and complete, ready to run as-is.
- Assume inputs are always well-formed as implied by the pseudocode; do not implement additional input validation.
- Ensure the program executes efficiently, completing within 5 seconds on typical inputs.

Provide strictly and only the Python source code within the specified code block.
