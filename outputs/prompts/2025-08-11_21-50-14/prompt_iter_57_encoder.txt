Generate clear, concise, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the problem description using mostly natural language with symbolic operators and common abbreviations. Write each instruction as a single short line, expressing loops and conditionals in the form `keyword condition: action`. Use simple keywords like `let`, `read`, `set`, `for`, `if`, `while`, `print`, and `return`, placing the action immediately after the colon. Number lines starting exactly at 1 as shown:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Choose readable, descriptive but concise variable names without excessive abbreviation. Declare variables or their types only when it improves clarity. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines with no blank lines, separator lines, comments, summaries, explanations, or notes. Avoid multi-line blocks and indentation-only lines; any nested logic should remain on the same line with the condition keyword.

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
	set min_i to i  
	for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
