Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the problem description using mostly natural language blended with symbolic operators and common abbreviations. Write each instruction as a single short line using the format `keyword condition: action` for loops and conditionals. Use clear, descriptive yet brief variable names without excessive abbreviation. Use simple keywords like `let`, `read`, `set`, `for`, `if`, `while`, `print`, and `return`, placing the action right after the colon. Number lines starting exactly from 1, no blank lines, no comments, no explanations or summaries in output. Avoid multi-line or indentation-only lines; nest all conditions and loops on the same line. Do not include separator lines or extra formatting.

The output must strictly follow this format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
	set min_i to i  
	forj = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
