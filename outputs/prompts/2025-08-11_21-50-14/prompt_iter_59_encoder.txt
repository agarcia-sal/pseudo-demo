Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the problem description that is easy to read, compact, and mostly in natural language with selective symbolic operators and standard abbreviations. Write each instruction as a single line numbered from 1, without blank lines, comments, explanations, or summaries. Use simple keywords: `let`, `read`, `set`, `for`, `if`, `while`, `print`, `return`. For loops and conditionals, format as `keyword condition: action` on the same line without multi-line nesting or indentation beyond what fits in one line. Use clear, descriptive yet brief variable names without excessive abbreviation. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting.

The output must follow this format exactly:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
	set min_i to i  
	forj=i+1 to size of A exclusive  
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
