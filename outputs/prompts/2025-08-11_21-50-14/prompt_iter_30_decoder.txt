You will be given pseudocode that describes an algorithm or complete program. Your goal is to produce a single, fully functional Python script that:

- Faithfully and exactly implements the pseudocode’s logic without adding, removing, or altering any behavior.
- Reads all required inputs solely from calls to input() without arguments.
- Outputs all results exclusively via print() calls, matching the pseudocode’s output format exactly.
- Uses clear, idiomatic, and efficient Python constructs and standard libraries; third-party libraries may only be used if they significantly improve correctness or performance and are commonly available.
- Contains no comments, explanations, extra text, or diagnostic output—only pure Python code.
- Is enclosed precisely within one Python code block formatted as
  ```python
  (code)
  ```
  with no additional text or delimiters before or after the block.
- Avoids separator lines or any output unrelated to the problem.
- Is optimized for clarity, correctness, and performance; it must be runnable as-is and complete within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Assumes inputs conform exactly to the pseudocode’s implied format; do not add input validation or error handling beyond what is necessary.

Output only the exact Python solution inside the specified Python markdown code block.
