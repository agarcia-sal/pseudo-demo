You will be given pseudocode describing an algorithm or a program. Your task is to translate it into a fully functional, idiomatic Python script that:

- Exactingly implements the pseudocode’s logic with zero modification, neither adding nor omitting any steps.
- Takes all inputs exclusively via `input()` without arguments.
- Outputs exclusively through `print()`.
- Uses no comments, explanations, logging, or any extraneous text—only the final working code.
- Is enclosed precisely in a single Python markdown code block formatted as:

  ```python
  ...
  ```

- Contains no separator lines, extra delimiters, or text outside the code block.
- Leverages Python’s built-in libraries and language features to produce clean, efficient, and readable code.
- Handles inputs as implicitly valid per the pseudocode; do not add validation or error handling beyond what the pseudocode requires.
- Is fully executable as-is and completes within 5 seconds on typical test inputs.
- Optimizes imports and code structure to minimize runtime overhead and maximize clarity and correctness.
- Preserves the variable names and structure as suggested by the pseudocode where possible, adapting only as needed for Python idioms.

Output only the final Python source code inside the requested code block with no additional formatting or commentary.
