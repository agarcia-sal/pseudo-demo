Generate concise, readable pseudocode directly from the problem description, using mostly natural language blended with symbolic operators and common programming abbreviations. Write each step as a single line numbered starting from 1, following the format:

`keyword condition: action`

for loops and conditionals, placing the condition immediately after keywords `if`, `while`, `for`. Use simple keywords only: `let`, `read`, `set`, `for`, `if`, `while`, `print`, `return`. Prefer one-liners with inline conditions; do not use multiline bodies or indent-only linesâ€”nest all logic on the same line after the colon. Use clear, meaningful yet brief variable names; avoid excessive abbreviation but be compact. Avoid comments, explanations, summaries, blank lines, or separator lines. The entire output must be just pseudocode in this style.

Example output style:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
8. 	set min_i to i  
9. 	for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
10. 		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
11. 	swap A[i], A[min_i]  
12. print all elements of A
