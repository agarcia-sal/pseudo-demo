Translate the given pseudocode into correct, clear, and efficient Python code that matches the logic exactly, including all necessary class and function definitions with the same names as indicated or implied in the pseudocode. Your entire output must be a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# Translated Python code here
```

Make sure to:

- Include all required definitions (e.g., classes like `Solution` or `ListNode`) if they are referenced or implied in the pseudocode or expected usage.
- Use idiomatic Python that is easy to read and efficient.
- Preserve input and output formats consistent with common coding challenge platforms (e.g., use methods inside a `Solution` class if typical).
- Avoid extraneous explanations, comments, or outputâ€”only code inside the one code block.
- Optimize for correctness, completeness, and runtime within 5 seconds.
- You may use built-in and standard Python libraries as needed.

Focus on producing runnable code that can be invoked as in typical test setups without causing `NameError` or related runtime errors due to missing classes, functions, or variable definitions.
