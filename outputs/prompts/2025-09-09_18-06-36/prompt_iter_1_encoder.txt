Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be compact, high-level, and use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where possible. Use mainly one-liners and avoid comments, explanations, purpose statements, summaries, or overviews. Follow this format exactly:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure clarity and understandability without extra notes. Prioritize brevity and simplicity in structure. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
