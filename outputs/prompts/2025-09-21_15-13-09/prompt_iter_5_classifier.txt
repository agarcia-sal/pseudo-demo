Given an arbitrary pseudocode snippet implementing some algorithm or function(s), your task is to judge whether the pseudocode is fully reproducible, meaning it **correctly implements the intended logic well enough to pass all possible unit tests for that specification** without ambiguity, missing detail, or logical errors.

**Instructions:**

- Carefully analyze the pseudocode’s clarity, logical completeness, correctness, and determinism.
- Consider if the pseudocode, as written, would pass **all** unit tests that validate the problem it addresses.
- Output **only a single digit:**
  - **1** — if the pseudocode is reproducible (guaranteed to pass all unit tests)
  - **0** — if it is not reproducible (contains errors, incomplete logic, or ambiguity preventing it from passing all tests)
- Output **no explanations, no additional text, no formatting, no quotes**, just the digit.
- Do this for each pseudocode in the exact order given; the outputs should correspond positionally to the inputs.

**Remember:** Your judgment should measure absolute reproducibility from the pseudocode alone, even without external context or assumptions.

**Format**

Input: pseudocode (one or multiple snippets, one at a time)  
Output: either `1` or `0` strictly per snippet, nothing else.

This prompt explicitly defines reproducibility as the ability to pass every unit test, while emphasizing focus on logic completeness and correctness, and requesting succinct, unambiguous output in strict numeric form correlated to input order, which improves clarity of the classification task and reduces misinterpretation.
