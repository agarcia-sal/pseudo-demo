Given pseudocode as input, output **1** if the pseudocode is definitively correct and guaranteed to pass all unit tests (i.e., fully reproducible) **based solely on the logic and completeness presented**, or **0** if it is incomplete, logically flawed, ambiguous, or insufficient to guarantee passing all relevant tests. Output **only a single digit (1 or 0) per pseudocode, in the exact input order, with no additional text, explanation, or formatting.**  
To determine reproducibility, analyze whether the pseudocode:  
- Is fully specified with no missing cases or ambiguous steps  
- Uses well-defined data flows and control structures  
- Ensures correctness for all possible inputs within the problem domain  
- Avoids logical contradictions or gaps that would cause test failures  
Do not assume any external knowledge, tests, or implementations beyond what is provided. Provide a single digit output for each pseudocode snippet strictly according to these criteria.
