Given a piece of pseudocode, determine if it is *fully reproducible*—meaning it is complete, logically consistent, and detailed enough to pass **all** unit tests based solely on the provided information. Consider whether the pseudocode unambiguously defines all inputs, outputs, intermediate computations, and control flows without missing critical steps or relying on unspecified assumptions.

Output exactly **1** if the pseudocode guarantees passing every unit test, or **0** if it fails to do so (due to incompleteness, ambiguity, logical flaws, or missing details).

Do not provide any explanations, commentary, or additional text—output only a single digit, without quotes or spaces.

**The outputs must be in the exact order the pseudocodes are inputted.**
