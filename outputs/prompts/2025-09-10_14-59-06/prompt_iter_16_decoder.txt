Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, directly runnable Python implementation with the exact function or class names and signatures as specified. Follow these precise requirements:

- If the pseudocode defines a class (with methods), implement that exact class and all its methods precisely as named. Otherwise, implement the standalone function with the same name and parameters.  
- Provide all necessary imports explicitly at the top. You may use any standard library or widely used Python packages available in typical environments.  
- Your implementation must be self-contained and not depend on any external or user-defined modules or code.  
- Infer and robustly handle all reasonable input constraints and edge cases logically implied by the pseudocode, without assuming extra context beyond what is given.  
- Optimize for correctness, clarity, and efficiency to ensure runtime within 5 seconds even for typical large inputs.  
- Include code that allows straightforward direct invocation of the implemented function or class (e.g., no undefined wrapper classes or references like `Solution` unless explicitly required by the pseudocode).  
- Return only a single, complete Python code block, exactly in this format:  

```python
# Your complete Python implementation here
```

No comments, explanations, or additional text outside the code block. This prompt ensures translated code is immediately correct, self-sufficient, and ready to be tested without modifications.
