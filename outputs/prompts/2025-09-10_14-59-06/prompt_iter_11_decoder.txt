Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, correct, and efficiently executable Python implementation that meets the following criteria:

- Define the function (or class with methods if clearly specified by the pseudocode) using the **exact function name and parameter list** implied or stated in the pseudocode.
- Include all necessary imports within the code block; only standard Python libraries or widely used packages available in typical environments are allowed.
- Deliver a single, self-contained Python function or class (if explicitly required) that runs independently without reliance on user-defined or external modules.
- Anticipate and handle common and edge cases logically derivable from the pseudocode without guessing problem-specific details beyond what is implied.
- Craft your solution to be clear, idiomatic, and optimized for performance, ensuring it can run within **5 seconds** on typical inputs.
- Return strictly **only the Python code**, wrapped in a single Python code block as below without any explanations, comments, or additional text:

```python
# Complete Python implementation here
```

Adhere closely to these instructions to maximize correctness, robustness, and test-time performance.
