Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, correct, and optimized Python function exactly matching the function name and signature implied or described in the pseudocode. Your output must:

- Include all necessary imports.
- Implement fully runnable code, handling typical and edge cases logically inferred from the pseudocode.
- Use clear, idiomatic Python that prioritizes readability and efficiency, ensuring execution under 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Define the function standalone (not inside any class) unless the pseudocode explicitly dictates otherwise.
- Enclose the entire code in a single, contiguous Python code block as shown below.  
- Do not include any explanations, comments, or text outside the code block.
