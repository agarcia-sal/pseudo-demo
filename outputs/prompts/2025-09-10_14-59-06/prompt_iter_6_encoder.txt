Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description that precisely mirrors the original function name and its logic. Use compact, high-level natural language with symbolic notations, abbreviations, and one-line statements where possible. Avoid any explanations, summaries, notes, or comments—output only the pseudocode steps. Preserve the function name as in the original code. Use this numbered format strictly:

1. in function [function_name]  
2. let [var] ← [initial_value]  
3. while [condition]: do [statement]  
4. for [var] in [range]: do [statement]  
...  

Aim for simplicity and brevity while maintaining clarity and correctness. Do not include separator lines or extra formatting. Output pseudocode that can be understood and translated back to code within a 5-second runtime constraint.
