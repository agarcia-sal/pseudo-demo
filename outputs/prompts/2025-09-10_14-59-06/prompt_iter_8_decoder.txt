Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, efficient, and idiomatic Python implementation. Your output must strictly adhere to these requirements:

- Preserve the exact function name and signature as indicated or directly implied by the pseudocode.
- Include all necessary imports within the code.
- Provide a single, standalone Python function or class (only if explicitly required by the pseudocode) that can run independently without external dependencies beyond the standard library or common packages.
- Infer and implement reasonable handling for typical and edge test cases based purely on the pseudocode logic.
- Prioritize clarity, performance, and correctness of the code, with efficient algorithms and data structures to ensure execution within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Return only the complete Python code enclosed in one contiguous Python code block:
```python
# Your fully implemented Python code here
```
- Do NOT include explanations, comments, or any other text outside the code block.
