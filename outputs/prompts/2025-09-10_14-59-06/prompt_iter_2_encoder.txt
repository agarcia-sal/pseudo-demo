Generate concise, high-level pseudocode directly from the given problem description, preserving the original function and variable names exactly.  
Use clear, natural language that is easy to follow, emphasizing brevity and readability.  
Express operations compactly with symbolic notations and abbreviations where suitable, favoring one-liners and minimal nesting.  
Do not include any purpose statements, summaries, explanations, notes, or comments—output only the pseudocode steps.  
Structure the output as a numbered list of sequential instructions, for example:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines or extraneous formatting.  
Focus exclusively on the algorithmic logic necessary to solve the problem efficiently within a 5-second runtime constraint.
