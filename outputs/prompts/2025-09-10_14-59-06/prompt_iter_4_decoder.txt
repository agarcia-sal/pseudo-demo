Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, efficient, and clean Python function. Your output must:

- Use exactly the same function name and signature as implied or described in the pseudocode.
- Include all necessary import statements.
- Implement complete, runnable Python code that mirrors the logic of the pseudocode precisely.
- Handle typical edge cases and inputs as reasonably inferred.
- Produce code enclosed solely within one Python code block like this:

```python
# Your complete translated code here
```

Do **not** include any explanations, comments, or text outside the code block.  
Use any standard Python libraries you find necessary to improve clarity and performance.  
Optimize the solution for correctness, readability, and ensure it reliably runs within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
