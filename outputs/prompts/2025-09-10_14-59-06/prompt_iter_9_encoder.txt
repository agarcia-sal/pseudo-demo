Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description that exactly preserves the original function name. Use natural, compact, high-level language with symbolic notations, abbreviations, and one-line statements where possible. Do not include any explanations, comments, or summaries—output only the pseudocode steps. Prefer brevity while keeping clarity and correctness. Use this numbered format strictly (without separator lines):

1. in function [function_name]  
2. let [var] ← [initial_value]  
3. for [var] in [range]: do [statement]  
4. while [condition]: do [statement]  
5. if [condition]: do [statement] else do [statement]  
6. return [value]

Structure loops and conditionals clearly but keep them compact and straightforward. Write steps so they can be understood and translated back to code within a 5-second runtime constraint.
