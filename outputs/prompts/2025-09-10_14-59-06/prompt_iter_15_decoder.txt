Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, correct, and efficient Python implementation, strictly adhering to these instructions:

- Precisely implement the function or class exactly as named in the pseudocode with identical parameters and signatures.  
- If the pseudocode defines a class with methods, implement the class and all specified methods accordingly. Otherwise, implement a standalone function.  
- Include **all necessary imports** explicitly at the top of the code; you may use any Python standard library or well-known packages commonly available in typical Python environments.  
- Guarantee the solution is fully self-contained and can run independently without relying on any external or user-defined modules or code.  
- Infer and explicitly handle any reasonable input constraints and edge cases logically implied by the pseudocode without assuming additional problem details or inputs.  
- Optimize the code for clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiency to always complete within **5 seconds** for typical input sizes.  
- Return only a single Python code block formatted exactly as below, containing the entire implementation with no explanations, comments, or extra text:  

```python
# Your full Python implementation here
```

This will ensure your translated code is directly usable and consistently correct when tested in any standard Python environment.
