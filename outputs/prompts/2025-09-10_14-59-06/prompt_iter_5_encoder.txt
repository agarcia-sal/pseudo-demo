Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the provided problem description, preserving the exact function name as in the original code. Write the pseudocode to be high-level and compact, using natural language with symbolic notations, abbreviations, and one-liners wherever possible. Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—only the pseudocode steps.

Use this numbered format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Focus on algorithmic steps only, ensuring completeness and correctness within a 5-second runtime constraint. Keep the pseudocode self-contained and readable without extra separators or formatting.
