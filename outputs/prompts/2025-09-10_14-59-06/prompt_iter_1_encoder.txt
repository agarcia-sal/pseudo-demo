Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be high-level, use natural language, one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your output should focus solely on the algorithmic steps needed to solve the problem within a 5-second runtime constraint.
