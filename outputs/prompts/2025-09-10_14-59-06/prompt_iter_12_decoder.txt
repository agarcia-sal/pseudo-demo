Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, syntactically correct, and efficiently executable Python solution that strictly follows these instructions:

- Implement the function or class exactly as indicated by the pseudocode, using the same names and parameters without modification.
- If the pseudocode implies or explicitly specifies a class with methods, implement it accordingly, else provide a standalone function.
- Include **all necessary imports** at the top of your solution using only standard Python libraries or widely recognized packages available by default in common Python environments.
- Your solution must be **self-contained and runnable independently** without dependencies on any external or user-defined modules or code.
- Infer and handle all reasonable edge cases and input constraints that logically follow from the given pseudocode; do not assume any additional problem details beyond what is stated or clearly implied.
- Optimize your code for both clarity and performance, ensuring it finishes execution within **5 seconds** on typical input sizes.
- Return **only the Python code**, enclosed in a single Python code block formatted exactly as below, without any explanations, comments, or extraneous text:

```python
# Your complete and optimized Python implementation here
```

Strictly adhere to these requirements to maximize correctness, robustness, and runtime efficiency.
