Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and fully functional Python code while strictly preserving all original class names, function names, and data structures as presented. Your output must:

- Retain exact class and method signatures as in the pseudocode.
- Implement logic faithfully and efficiently, optimizing clarity and performance to ensure execution within 5 seconds.
- Include appropriate Python imports only if necessary for correctness and best practice.
- Enclose the complete translated code within a single Python code block as shown below:
  
```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

Avoid adding any extra explanation, comments beyond those needed for clarity, or unrelated code. Prioritize readable, idiomatic Python while faithfully representing the original pseudocodeâ€™s intent and structure.
