Generate pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understandable, using concise, high-level instructions with natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Prefer one-liners and compact constructs. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity. Your output should focus solely on the logic steps needed to solve the problem. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
