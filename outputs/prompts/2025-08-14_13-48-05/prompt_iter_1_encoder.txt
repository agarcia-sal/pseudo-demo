Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a compact, high-level style with natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Format each step as a numbered line with assignments and control structures on one line if possible. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clear, understandable pseudocode that fits within a 5-second generation time.
