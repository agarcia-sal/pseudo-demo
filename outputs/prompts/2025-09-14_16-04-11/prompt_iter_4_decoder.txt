Translate the given pseudocode into precise, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that preserves all class names, method names, and object structures exactly as stated in the pseudocode. Your solution must:

- Be enclosed entirely within a single Python code block using triple backticks and `python`.
- Use only standard Python libraries unless the pseudocode explicitly requires third-party packages.
- Accurately implement the logic as described, avoiding assumptions or omissions.
- Maintain clean readability with proper naming, spacing, and comments where helpful.
- Include necessary type hints if applicable in the pseudocode.
- Handle common edge cases relevant to the problem, ensuring robust and bug-free output.
- Optimize the code to run efficiently within a 5-second timeout.
- Avoid adding extraneous functionality or altering method signatures.
- If the pseudocode references data structures or input types (such as linked lists), define supporting classes or conversions needed to match the pseudocode context exactly.

Do not include any explanation or text outside the code block. Only provide the correct, optimized Python code translation.
