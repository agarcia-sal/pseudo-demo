Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic forms, prefer one-liners, abbreviations, and high-level steps. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should be compact, clear, and understandable within a 5-second execution limit.
