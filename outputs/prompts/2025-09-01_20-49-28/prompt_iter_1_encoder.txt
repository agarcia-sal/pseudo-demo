Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a high-level style with natural language, symbolic expressions, abbreviations, and one-liners where possible. Do not include purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Use the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and compactness. Your pseudocode should be understandable without extra notes and complete within a 5-second timeout.
