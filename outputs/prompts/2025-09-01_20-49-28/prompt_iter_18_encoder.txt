Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode that directly implements the solution using the exact original function names and signatures. Use a natural yet compact style blending natural language with symbolic expressions, abbreviations, and one-liners wherever suitable. Favor simple control structures like `if`, `else if`, `for`, `while`, and direct assignments without unnecessary filler words (“let,” “set,” or “initialize”) unless essential for clarity. Use implicit loops and concise expressions for brevity. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines without any comments, explanations, summaries, or separators. Format lines succinctly as:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode solution is fully self-contained, clear, and balanced between brevity and completeness, preserving original function names exactly. Example style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
