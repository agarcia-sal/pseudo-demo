Translate the provided pseudocode into a concise, efficient, and production-quality Python implementation that perfectly preserves the original function names, parameters, and logic flow. Your output must meet these criteria:

- Output only valid, executable Python code enclosed within a single triple-backtick block labeled `python` (```python ... ```), with no additional text, comments, or explanations.
- Preserve exact function names and parameter names as given, adding precise type hints inferred from the pseudocode. Import only minimal modules from the Python standard library or widely used packages if absolutely necessary.
- Leverage Pythonic idioms, built-in functions, and standard library features that improve clarity and performance while maintaining faithful adherence to the pseudocode logic.
- Ensure your code robustly handles any reasonable implied edge cases and completes execution well within 5 seconds for typical inputs.
- Avoid redundant variables, superfluous computations, or scaffolding codeâ€”produce minimal implementations that are immediately usable in production.
- Do not introduce any placeholder, debugging, or explanatory content. Your submission must be strictly and entirely the implemented Python function(s).

Follow these instructions rigorously to maximize correctness, clarity, runtime efficiency, and usability.
