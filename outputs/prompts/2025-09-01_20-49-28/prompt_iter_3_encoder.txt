Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that directly reflects the problem description and original code logic, preserving all original function names exactly. Use a readable natural language style enriched with minimal symbolic notation and abbreviations, favoring compactness without sacrificing clarity. Prefer implicit, expressive loop constructs like “for i in range” or “for all elements,” and use one-line conditionals and assignments wherever clear. Avoid any explanatory text, comments, summaries, or notes—only output the pseudocode itself. Use direct assignments rather than verbose phrases (e.g., prefer “x ← 0” over “let x be 0”). Return values simply with “return”. Format the output as a numbered list illustrating step-by-step logic, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Omit any separator lines or decorations. Ensure the pseudocode stands alone as a compact, clear, and complete algorithm easily understood without any external context.
