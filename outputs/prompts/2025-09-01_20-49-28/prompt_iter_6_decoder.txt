Translate the given pseudocode into well-structured, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that fully implements the described functionality using the exact function names and signatures provided. Enclose your entire response **only** within a single Python code block marked with triple backticks and the word `python` (```python ... ```).  
- Prioritize correctness, clarity, and performance (running within 5 seconds).  
- Use Python standard library and built-in functions freely to produce clean and concise code.  
- Avoid adding any explanation, comments, or text outside the code block.  
- Do not modify the function names or signatures specified in the pseudocode.  
- Ensure the code is ready to run as-is, with complete implementations faithful to the pseudocode logic.
