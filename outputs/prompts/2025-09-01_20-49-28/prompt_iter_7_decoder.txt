Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, idiomatic Python implementation, preserving the exact function names given. Your solution must be correct, efficient, and easily readable, using Python best practices and standard library tools where appropriate. Enclose **only** the complete Python code within a single triple-backtick code block labeled `python` (```python ... ```); do not include any additional explanation, comments, or output outside this block. The entire implementation should be concise enough to run within a 5-second execution limit and must not introduce any extraneous code or separators.
