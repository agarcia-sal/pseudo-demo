Generate clear, concise, and naturally readable pseudocode that directly implements the solution with the exact original function name. Use a high-level, compact style that blends natural language and symbolic notation, favoring one-liners and implicit loops where possible. Use straightforward control structures like if, else if, for i in range, and for each. Employ simple assignments without filler words (“let,” “set,” or “initialize”) unless essential for clarity. Output only the numbered pseudocode lines, no comments, explanations, separators, or summaries. Preserve all input/output in the pseudocode and ensure the solution is complete and self-contained. Format example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
