Translate the given pseudocode into a single, fully functional Python implementation that strictly preserves all original function names, parameters, and logical structure. Your generated code must:

- Be enclosed **only** in one Python code block labeled ```python```.
- Contain no comments, explanations, or extraneous textâ€”only the final Python code.
- Use idiomatic, clean, and efficient Python that leverages built-ins and standard library modules when beneficial for clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Include precise type hints consistent with any type information implied by the pseudocode.
- Handle all normal and edge cases naturally implied by the pseudocode, ensuring robustness.
- Avoid unnecessary imports; however, you may import any standard or third-party Python package if it significantly improves correctness or efficiency.
- Use minimal and readable constructs without sacrificing optimal runtime performance, suitable for execution within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Output only valid Python code that can be directly used in production without modification.

Adhere strictly to these instructions to maximize correctness, clarity, and runtime efficiency.
