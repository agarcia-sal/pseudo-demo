Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, idiomatic Python implementation with exactly the same function name(s) and structure. Prioritize correctness, clarity, and optimal performance, making full use of Pythonâ€™s standard library and built-in features. The code should be minimal yet readable, avoiding unnecessary verbosity, comments, or unused imports. If necessary for correct typing, include relevant imports, but keep them minimal. Your entire solution must be enclosed **only** within a single triple-backtick Python code block (```python ... ```). Do not include explanations, comments, separator lines, or any text outside the code block. The final code must execute correctly within 5 seconds and should be self-contained, efficient, and clean. You may use any publicly available Python packages if they improve correctness or efficiency.
