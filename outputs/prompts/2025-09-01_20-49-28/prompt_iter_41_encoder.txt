Generate concise, clear, and readable pseudocode that strictly implements the original code’s logic using exact original function and parameter names. Write the pseudocode in a high-level style that blends natural language with symbolic operators and abbreviations, favoring brevity through implicit iterations and expressions, one-liners, and direct assignments without filler words like “let,” “set,” or “initialize” unless necessary for clarity or typing. Use simple control flow constructs (if, else if, for i in range, for each) and direct return statements. Avoid comments, explanations, headers, summaries, or separators. Output only numbered lines with the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Pseudocode should be complete, self-contained, easy to read, and maintain the exact original function signature and names. Prefer compact, high-level expressions and natural phrasing without verbosity. Use whitespace and indentation consistently but avoid extraneous details. Produce output in precise numbered steps only.
