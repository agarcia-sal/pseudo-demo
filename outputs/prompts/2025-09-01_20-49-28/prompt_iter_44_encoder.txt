Generate concise, readable pseudocode that exactly preserves the original function names and parameter names. Express the logic compactly using a blend of natural language, symbolic operators, and idiomatic abbreviations. Favor one-liners, implicit iterations, and simple control structures (if, else if, for, for each, while) with minimal filler words—avoid “let,” “set,” or “initialize” unless needed for clarity or data types. Write direct return statements only. Omit comments, explanations, headers, separators, or summaries—output only the numbered pseudocode lines. Use the following format (line number, period, space, then pseudocode):

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure each solution is complete, self-contained, and easy to follow while balancing brevity and clarity. Preserve original function signatures exactly. No lines or sections other than numbered pseudocode lines. For example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for each element i in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
