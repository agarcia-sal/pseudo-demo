Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Present the pseudocode in numbered steps, using mostly one-liners and high-level constructs. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best possible result within this limit.
