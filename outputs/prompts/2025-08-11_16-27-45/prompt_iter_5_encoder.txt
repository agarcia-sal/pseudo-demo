Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use clear, natural language mixed with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to read. Represent logic primarily as one-liners with minimal nesting, avoiding verbose details. Number each step sequentially as shown:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include purpose statements, summaries, explanations, comments, or notes. Focus solely on the pseudocode itself, capturing essential operations and control flow in a straightforward manner. Use phrases like "let", "set", "read", "print", and common loops or conditionals expressed succinctly. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Produce output that directly reflects a clear algorithmic procedure suitable for implementation.
