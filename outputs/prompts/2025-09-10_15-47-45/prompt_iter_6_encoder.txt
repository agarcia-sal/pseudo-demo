Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description by strictly following the original function’s name and parameters. The pseudocode must be easy to read and compact, using natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations. Prefer one-line statements where possible and use indentation for nested blocks, but keep lines as brief as feasible. Use concise constructs for loops, conditionals, assignments, and data operations. Do not include any explanation, summary, comments, or notes—output only the pseudocode. Do not use separator lines.

Use this exact format (example):

in function FunctionName  
let variables be typed or implied  
read or initialize inputs as needed  
for or while loops in compact form  
conditional statements concise and symbolic  
single-line assignments preferred (e.g., x ← 0, while x < n: x++)  
return as in original function

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i from 0 to n-1  
  min_i ← i  
  for j from i+1 to n-1  
    if A[min_i] > A[j]: min_i ← j  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
