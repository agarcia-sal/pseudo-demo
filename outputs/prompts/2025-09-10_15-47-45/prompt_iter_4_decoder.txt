Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code.  
- Keep the exact function name and signature as implied or explicitly given in the pseudocode.  
- Enclose the entire solution exclusively within a single Python code block formatted with triple backticks followed by `python` (i.e., \```python ... \```).  
- Implement all logic accurately and completely, ensuring the output matches the expected behavior described or implied by the pseudocode.  
- You may leverage any standard or third-party Python packages if they help improve efficiency or clarity.  
- Avoid adding any text or explanation outside the code block.  
- Make the code readable, concise, and performant, targeting correctness within a 5-second runtime limit.  
- If the pseudocode implies use of a class (e.g., Solution) or namespaces, define them accordingly; if not, provide a standalone function.  
- Include all necessary imports, helper functions, and edge case handling so the code runs independently and correctly.
