Translate the provided pseudocode into complete, clean, and efficient Python code with the **exact same function name** and signature as indicated or clearly implied by the pseudocode.  
- Enclose your entire solution strictly inside **one** Python code block formatted as:  
  \```python  
  ...  
  \```  
- If the pseudocode suggests a class (e.g., `Solution`) or namespace, implement that class with all necessary methods; otherwise, provide a standalone function.  
- Include all necessary imports, helper functions, and thorough edge case handling to ensure that the code runs independently without errors.  
- Your implementation must fully and accurately reflect the logic and behavior of the pseudocode without omission.  
- Use any appropriate standard or third-party Python libraries to maximize clarity, efficiency, and runtime performance, respecting a 5-second execution limit.  
- Do not output any explanation, comments, or text outside the code block.  
- Optimize for correctness, readability, and performance to pass rigorous automated testing.
