Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description without including any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Use natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Prefer one-liners where possible. Do not add comments or explanations. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Return only the pseudocode, structured similarly to the example above. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for clarity and brevity within this limit.
