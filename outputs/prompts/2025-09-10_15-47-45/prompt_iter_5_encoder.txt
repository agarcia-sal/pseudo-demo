Generate clear, concise pseudocode from the given problem description capturing the exact original function name and parameters. Use mostly natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Prefer short one-line statements for assignments, loops, and conditionals. Use indentation only for nested blocks, keeping each line as brief as possible while preserving clarity. Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode. Follow this exact format (no separator lines):

in function FunctionName
let variables be appropriately typed or implied
assignment and control flow statements in short form (e.g., x ← 0, while x < n: x++)
use concise constructs for loops, conditionals, and data operations
return values exactly as in the original function

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
