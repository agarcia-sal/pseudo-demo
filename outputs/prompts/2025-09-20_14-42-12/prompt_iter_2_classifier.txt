Evaluate the following pseudocode to determine whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”meaning it contains all necessary steps, is free of ambiguity or logical errors, is self-contained, and thus guaranteed to pass all valid unit tests for its intended purpose.  
Output **only** a single digit: **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible, else **0** if it is incomplete, ambiguous, or logically flawed.  
Do not provide explanations, clarifications, or any other output.  
The outputs must correspond in order to the pseudocodes provided.
