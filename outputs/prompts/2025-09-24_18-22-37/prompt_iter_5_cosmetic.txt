Rewrite the given pseudocode into a new version that is logically and functionally identical—preserving every detail of its behavior, output, and algorithmic effect—with absolutely no changes to original function names, class names, or their hierarchical/class-object structures. Your response must contain only pseudocode, with no explanations, comments, or formatting beyond the pseudocode itself.

Your rewrite should maximize all possible syntactic and stylistic differences from the original pseudocode while guaranteeing exact semantic equivalence. To achieve this:

- Completely rename all variables and parameters in a consistent, systematic manner distinct from original names.
- Change all control flow constructs by employing varied forms and alternatives: convert FOR loops to WHILE loops, WHILE loops to FOR loops, IF statements to SWITCH/CASE, SWITCH/CASE to IF/ELSE chains, use early returns versus nested blocks, etc.
- Reorder independent statements and computations where the evaluation order does not change meaning.
- Adopt alternative idiomatic expressions, synonyms, and phrasing for assignments, arithmetic, comparisons, logical operations, and data structure access.
- Restructure expressions and breakdown complex operations into smaller steps or consolidate simpler steps, as long as functionality is unaffected.
- Modify the pseudocode’s formatting, indentation style, and layout to differ from the original.
- Avoid any semantic shortcuts or simplified abstractions that change the algorithmic process or output values.
- Maintain the exact output format and ensure no change to function signatures or class hierarchy.
- Do not omit or add any operation, condition, or computation.

Produce only the rewritten pseudocode plain text exactly as you would pseudocode—without markdown code fences, annotations, commentary, or any other text. The goal is to preserve unambiguous correctness and output invariance while maximizing syntactic, stylistic, and structural divergence from the input pseudocode.
