Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally identical version that preserves all behavior, outputs, and algorithmic effects exactly as in the original, including the same function names, class names, and the exact class-object hierarchies. The output must be solely pseudocode text—no explanations, comments, annotations, or formatting other than what is required for valid pseudocode.

To maximize structural and stylistic divergence while guaranteeing semantic equivalence, strictly apply the following transformations throughout the entire pseudocode:

- Systematically rename every variable and parameter to new, consistent identifiers unrelated to originals.
- Replace all control flow constructs with alternative equivalent forms, e.g., convert FOR loops to WHILE loops or vice versa, transform IF statements to SWITCH/CASE or nested IF/ELSE chains, employ early returns and guard clauses instead of nested blocks, or vice versa.
- Rearrange independent statements or logically commutative computations to different orders without affecting outcome.
- Rewrite expressions by decomposing complex operations into sequences of simpler steps or by consolidating multiple steps, ensuring no change in logic.
- Use synonymous or alternative idiomatic phrasing for assignments, logical/comparison operators, arithmetic operations, and data access; e.g., replace “=” with “:=” or wording like “is equal to” with other clear equivalences.
- Alter formatting aspects extensively (indentation style, line breaks, spacing) within valid pseudocode syntax constraints.
- Preserve all operations, conditions, and computations exactly with no omissions, additions, or semantic shortcuts.
- Retain original function and class signatures with exact names and hierarchy; do not change these identifiers or structural relationships.
- Output only the rewritten pseudocode plain text exactly as pseudocode—no markdown code fences or extra text.

The goal is to produce a maximally syntactically and stylistically distinct pseudocode that is provably behaviorally equivalent, suitable for thorough obfuscation and diversity in representation tasks.
