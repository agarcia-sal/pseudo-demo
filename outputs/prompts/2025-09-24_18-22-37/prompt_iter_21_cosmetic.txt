Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that preserves identical input-output behavior, side effects, and overall functionality for all valid inputs, while being as distinct as possible lexically, syntactically, structurally, and stylistically from the original. Your rewritten pseudocode must adhere to these strict rules:

- All function names, class names, method signatures, and the original class hierarchy and nesting must remain unchanged in both name and structure.

- Rename exclusively all local variables and parameters to new, unrelated identifiers, ensuring consistent replacement throughout the rewritten code; do not rename or alter any global identifiers, functions, classes, or their environment.

- Thoroughly transform control flow with a diverse mix of the following transformations in arbitrary order, any or all combined as appropriate, always preserving logic:
  - Convert loops between FOR, WHILE, and REPEAT-UNTIL forms, including loop direction and iteration steps.
  - Replace IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH-CASEs, nested guards, or equivalent conditional structures; flatten nested conditionals or introduce nesting strategically.
  - Reorder mutually independent branches and statements without affecting program semantics.
  - Introduce early returns or consolidate multiple return points while retaining behavior.
  - Substitute loop indices with element-based iteration and vice versa, varying traversal order when safe.

- Decompose complex expressions into sequences of simpler assignments or merge sequences of operations into combined expressions using temporary helpers; substitute operators with logically equivalent alternatives or synonyms (e.g., “!=” ⇄ “not equal”, boolean operators with symbols or words, arithmetic transformations). Vary numeric literals where behavior is unchanged (e.g., use equivalent expressions, alternative literal forms).

- Reorder independent statements, computations, assignments, and data accesses where dependencies allow, while maintaining semantic equivalence.

- Change data structure access methods interchangeably (e.g., `array[index]` ⇄ `array.at(index)`), change iteration idioms, and traversal patterns (forward, backward, step sizes) freeing variation while ensuring correctness.

- Introduce auxiliary temporary variables or helper constructs as needed with unambiguous consistent naming, ensuring no semantic change.

- Randomize formatting extensively: indentation style, line breaks, statement grouping, whitespace usage, and overall pseudocode layout, always producing syntactically valid output.

- Do not apply any semantic shortcuts, algorithmic simplifications, or utilize built-in functions or library shortcuts that replace explicit computations; no optimizations that alter the step-by-step logic or output.

- The output must contain only the rewritten pseudocode text—no explanations, commentary, delimiters, or any text beyond the pseudocode itself.

Your aim is to maximize lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence from the input pseudocode while guaranteeing complete functional equivalence and preserving the same interface and class organization exactly as originally given. Output only this transformed pseudocode.
