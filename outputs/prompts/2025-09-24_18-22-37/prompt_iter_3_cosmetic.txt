Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a new version that retains exact functional behavior, producing identical inputs/outputs, but transforms the code extensively to maximize differences from the original. Your rewrite must:

- Keep every original function and class name unchanged, preserving all class/object hierarchies exactly.
- Alter all variable names, control structures, syntax style, formatting, and expression forms liberally.
- Replace loops with equivalent conditionals or recursion where appropriate, and vice versa.
- Vary conditional expressions, data manipulation techniques, and structural patterns as much as possible.
- Avoid any commentary, explanation, or added text; output only the rewritten pseudocode.
- Ensure the rewritten pseudocode is fully unambiguous and logically equivalent, passing all functional tests identically.

Focus on achieving maximal syntactic and stylistic divergence while preserving the original programâ€™s exact logic, behavior, and structure.
