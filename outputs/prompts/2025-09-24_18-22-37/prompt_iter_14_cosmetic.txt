Rewrite the input pseudocode into a new version that is semantically identical in every respect, producing exactly the same outputs, side effects, logic, control flow, and intermediate computations for all possible inputs, with no change to any functional behavior.

Strictly preserve all function names, class names, and the entire class-object hierarchy and order—do not rename, reorder, or restructure any of these global elements.

Your output must be only valid pseudocode text, without any explanations, comments, annotations, markdown formatting, or extra content.

To maximize difference from the original code at the lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic levels while maintaining perfect equivalence, apply *at least* all the following comprehensive transformations — distributing them consistently and intelligently throughout the pseudocode:

1. **Variable and parameter renaming:**  
   Replace every local variable and parameter name uniformly with new arbitrary identifiers unrelated to the originals, maintaining consistent renaming within scope and throughout, but do NOT rename or alter global identifiers like function or class names.

2. **Control flow refactoring:**  
   - Convert FOR-loops into equivalent WHILE-loops and vice versa, explicitly handling loop entry, exit conditions, and increments/decrements.  
   - Replace IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH-CASE or nested conditionals; flatten or deepen nested conditionals; reorder independent conditional branches wherever it does not affect semantics.  
   - Introduce or eliminate early returns as long as the overall logic and final outcomes remain identical.

3. **Statement and operation reordering:**  
   Identify all statements and computations that do not have data dependencies on each other and reorder them arbitrarily to alter flow and grouping without changing the algorithm’s correctness.

4. **Expression and operator transformation:**  
   - Break down complex expressions into stepwise intermediate assignments with temporaries, or combine sequential simple statements into compound expressions using helper variables.  
   - Replace arithmetic and logical operators with equivalent forms or verbose synonyms (for example, “plus”, “increment by”, “not equal to” for `!=`, “AND” ↔ “∧”), and consistently apply these substitutions throughout expressions.  
   - Alternate data access syntax if the domain allows (e.g., `array[index]` ↔ `array.at(index)` provided that they are equivalent).  
   - Represent numeric literals equivalently (like binary, decimal, or hexadecimal form) wherever the semantics allow exact substitution.

5. **Data structure traversal and iteration idioms:**  
   Substitute index-based iterations with element-based loops and vice versa; iterate collections with different but equivalent traversal orders or methods; reorder independent element accesses where safe.

6. **Preservation of signature, hierarchy, and semantics:**  
   - Keep all function and method signatures exactly as original, avoiding addition/removal/change of parameters or return structure.  
   - Do NOT rename or reorder function or class declarations or their place in the class-object hierarchy.  
   - Avoid semantic simplifications or replacements by shortcuts, built-in functions, or library calls that would alter the algorithm’s detailed stepwise execution or intermediate states.

7. **Consistent aliasing of temporary constructs:**  
   Any newly introduced temporary variables, helper constructs, or intermediate results must be given fresh, non-conflicting names and used consistently without ambiguity or overlap.

8. **Formatting and presentation diversity:**  
   Apply diverse but valid pseudocode formatting styles—vary indentation patterns, line breaks, statement grouping, and spacing arbitrarily, including expanding single-line statements into multi-line blocks or condensing multi-line blocks into single lines where possible.

Your final output must be a substantially transformed pseudocode that is syntactically, lexically, and structurally divergent from the input, yet provably functionally equivalent across all input cases.

Output only the rewritten pseudocode, nothing else.
