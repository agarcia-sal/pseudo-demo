Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a version that is fully functionally equivalent for all valid inputs—preserving exact function and class names, signatures, and the entire class-object hierarchy unchanged—but differs as much as possible lexically, syntactically, structurally, and stylistically from the original. Your rewritten pseudocode must:

- Rename all local variables and parameters consistently to fresh, unrelated names; do not rename or reorder any global identifiers, functions, classes, methods, or their hierarchical structure.
- Reorganize control flow extensively and creatively using arbitrary mixtures, including but not limited to: transforming FOR loops into WHILE loops and vice versa; converting IF-ELSE chains into SWITCH-CASE or nested guard clauses; flattening deeply nested conditionals or introducing nesting; reordering independent conditional branches; applying early exits or consolidating multiple returns; using different control constructs without changing semantics.
- Alter the order of independent statements, expressions, and computations where dependencies allow, breaking or merging statements as needed to maximize structural difference.
- Rewrite all expressions and operations by expanding complex expressions into multiple simpler assignments or combining simple steps into compound expressions; substitute operators with equivalent alternatives (e.g., replacing “!=” with “not equal to”, logical AND with ∧); vary numeric literals using equivalent forms (e.g., “2” as “1+1”); change data access and mutation styles (e.g., `array[index]` ⇄ `array.at(index)`) wherever valid.
- Vary iteration patterns and data traversal approaches: translate index-based loops into element-wise iteration and vice versa; reverse or reorder iteration directions when semantics permit; reorder accesses to independent data elements.
- Introduce new temporary or helper variables or constructs as needed, ensuring consistent, unambiguous usage throughout the rewritten pseudocode.
- Randomize formatting and layout extensively, including indentation styles, line breaks, statement grouping, and whitespace, as long as resulting pseudocode remains syntactically valid.
- Prohibit any semantic shortcuts, algorithmic simplifications, or replacing explicit computations with built-in functions or library calls that would alter stepwise behavior or output.
- Preserve all function and class signatures, names, and their positions in the class-object hierarchy exactly, with no renaming or reordering outside local variables.
- Output only the rewritten pseudocode text, with no explanations, comments, delimiters, or any extra content.

Your goal is to produce pseudocode that is unmistakably and substantially different in every lexical, syntactic, and structural dimension while guaranteeing identical functional behavior.
