Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally identical but radically transformed version that preserves all observable behaviors, outputs, side effects, and algorithmic logic for every valid input. Maintain exact function names and class names, along with their full class hierarchy and signatures—no renaming or reordering of these global identifiers or structural elements is allowed.

Your rewritten pseudocode must maximize differences from the original in all linguistic and structural aspects by applying a broad, varied, and creative combination of transformations, including but not limited to:

- Uniformly rename all local variables and parameters to consistently fresh, unrelated names, avoiding any overlap or similarity with original identifiers; do not rename any non-local/global names.

- Perform extensive control flow restructuring: interchange FOR, WHILE, and REPEAT loops arbitrarily; convert IF-ELSE chains into SWITCH-CASE, nested conditions, or early returns; flatten or deepen conditional nesting; reorder independent conditional branches and loops; introduce guard clauses, invert conditions, or consolidate return points without altering the logical semantics.

- Rigorously reorder independent statements and expression evaluations where dependencies allow, including independent assignment statements, computations, and side-effect-free expressions.

- Obfuscate or diversify expressions by either decomposing complex expressions into multiple simpler steps with temporary variables or aggregating several assignments into compound expressions; substitute operators with logically equivalent synonyms or verbalized forms (e.g., “!=” → “not equal to”, logical AND → “and”, “&&”, “∧”); interchange data access methods (e.g., `array[index]` ⇄ `array.at(index)`) only when semantics permit; represent numeric literals differently (e.g., decimal, hexadecimal, or arithmetic expressions) without changing numeric values.

- Modify data iteration and traversal idioms extensively: switch between index-based loops and element-based iterations; iterate forwards, backwards, or by custom step sizes when safe; reorder independent data accesses or element operations; replace recursion with iteration or vice versa only if no change in algorithmic outcomes occurs.

- Introduce, rename, remove (if redundant), or merge helper variables or intermediate constructs as needed to maximize syntactic and semantic indistinguishability, while preserving unambiguous and consistent usage.

- Vary formatting arbitrarily and freely within valid pseudocode syntax, including indentation styles, line breaks, whitespace, grouping, and ordering of semantically neutral constructs.

- Do not apply any semantic shortcuts, algorithmic simplifications, or remove explicit computational steps; do not replace code with built-in functions or library shortcuts that bypass detailed computation unless the originals explicitly use them.

- Do not rename or reorder function or class names or alter the class/object hierarchy structures — these must remain exactly as in the original.

Your output should be **exclusively** the fully rewritten pseudocode text, without any explanations, comments, delimiters, or additional content.

The goal is to produce a version lexically, syntactically, structurally, and stylistically maximally distinct from the input, while being provably and precisely functionally equivalent. Output only the transformed pseudocode.
