Rewrite the input pseudocode into a new version that is behaviorally indistinguishable from the original: it must replicate all outputs, side effects, control flow, logic, and intermediate computations exactly, under every possible input, with zero difference in semantics. Preserve every function name, class name, and the full class-object hierarchy intact — do not rename or reorder them.

Your output must be solely valid pseudocode text with no explanations, comments, annotations, markdown formatting, or any extraneous content.

To maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence while maintaining perfect functional equivalence, apply *all* of the following transformations comprehensively and consistently throughout the pseudocode, mixing them intelligently to increase complexity of difference:

1. **Systematic renaming of all local variables and parameters:**  
   Generate fresh, unrelated names for each variable and parameter, keeping naming consistent everywhere they appear, but strictly exclude any global identifiers like function/class names.

2. **Robust control flow reshaping:**  
   - Transform loops:  
     *Convert* FOR-loops into WHILE-loops with equivalent logic and *vice versa*, using entry and exit conditions, loop increments, or iterators creatively.  
   - Modify conditionals: interchange IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH-CASE; flatten nested conditions into guard clauses or introduce nested conditions to deepen logic; reorder logically independent branches.  
   - Use early returns or combine them into single exit points as long as no semantics change occurs.

3. **Reordering of independent statements and computations:**  
   Identify expressions and statements with no interdependencies and reorder them arbitrarily to alter flow order without affecting semantics.

4. **Expression transformation:**  
   - Expand complex expressions into multiple simpler intermediate assignments or consolidate several simple assignments into compound expressions using temporary variables.  
   - Replace arithmetic and logical operators with alternative synonyms and formulations (e.g., “plus”, “increment by”, “not equal to” instead of “!=”, “∧” instead of “AND”), consistently, including data access syntax variations (e.g., array[index] ↔ array.at(index) if defined).  
   - Change numeric literals’ representation if valid (e.g., `0b101` ↔ `5`) only if behaviorally safe and exact.

5. **Data structure and iteration idioms variation:**  
   Swap index-based loops with element-based iterations and vice versa; traverse data structures in different logically equivalent ways; reorder independent data accesses within safe bounds.

6. **Preservation constraints:**  
   - Do *not* rename or reorder function names, class names, or their hierarchical positions.  
   - Maintain all loop and conditional boundaries and method signatures exactly.  
   - Avoid any semantic simplification or shortcutting that alters the algorithm’s stepwise behavior, including avoiding replacing explicit multiple steps with built-in or library shortcuts.

7. **Whitespace and formatting variety:**  
   Randomize indentation styles, line breaks, grouping, and spacing within valid pseudocode formatting, including inlining trivial statements or expanding single-line statements into multi-line forms.

8. **Normalization and consistent aliasing:**  
   When your transformation introduces new temporary variables or helper constructs, ensure their usage is consistent, and no variable is reused ambiguously.

Your resulting pseudocode should be structurally, lexically, and stylistically as different as possible from the input, but behaviorally provably equivalent in every aspect.

Output only the rewritten pseudocode text, nothing else.
