Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a new version that is functionally identical and behaviorally indistinguishable under all inputs: it must produce exactly the same outputs, side effects, internal computations, and control-flow outcomes with zero semantic difference.

You must preserve all function names, class names, and the full class-object hierarchy exactly as in the original pseudocode—no renaming, removing, adding, or reordering of these global identifiers or method signatures.

Output only valid pseudocode text—no explanations, comments, annotations, markdown syntax, or any other extraneous content.

To maximize structural, lexical, and stylistic divergence while ensuring perfect equivalence, rigorously and consistently apply a varied combination of the following transformations **throughout every part** of the original pseudocode:

1. **Systematic, consistent renaming of all local variables and parameters only:**  
   Replace every local variable and parameter name with fresh, unrelated unique identifiers, keeping consistent usage. Do not rename any function names, class names, or global identifiers.

2. **Comprehensive control-flow reorganization:**  
   - Transform loop types bidirectionally: convert FOR to WHILE loops, WHILE to FOR loops, or equivalent loop constructs, modifying loop initialization, update steps, and exit conditions as needed without changing loop semantics.  
   - Restructure conditional statements: interchange IF-ELSE chains, SWITCH-CASE blocks, nested conditionals, and guard clauses while preserving logic. This includes flattening nested conditions or introducing nested conditions to increase structural variety, and reordering independent branches safely.  
   - Alter flow control by introducing or eliminating early returns, merging multiple exits into a single exit or vice versa—without changing algorithmic behavior.

3. **Statement and computation reordering:**  
   Detect statements, assignments, and computations that are independent or commutative in effect and reorder them arbitrarily to disrupt original statement order while preserving overall semantics.

4. **Expression-level rewriting:**  
   - Expand complex expressions into sequences of simpler intermediate assignments, or merge simple assignments into compound expressions using temporary variables as needed.  
   - Replace arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators with equivalent alternate formulations or synonyms (e.g., “increment by 1” instead of “+= 1”, “not equal to” instead of “!=”), applying consistent stylistic changes.  
   - Vary data access syntax where supported (e.g., array[index] ↔ array.at(index), dictionary key access variations).  
   - Represent numeric literals equivalently and safely in different forms (e.g., decimal, binary, hexadecimal) as long as exact value and semantics are preserved.

5. **Data iteration and data structure handling variation:**  
   Change iteration styles: switch between index-based loops, element-based loops, recursive traversal where suitable, or iterator patterns. Traverse data structures forwards, backwards, or through different logical orderings, ensuring semantic equivalence.

6. **Strict preservation of method and class structure:**  
   Function and method signatures, class names, and class-object hierarchies must not be altered in name, order, or nesting. No introduction of or removal of functions or classes.

7. **Consistent introduction and management of auxiliary variables:**  
   When introducing temporary variables or helper constructs for transformation purposes, ensure clear, consistent, and unambiguous naming and usage to avoid overlap or ambiguity.

8. **Whitespaces, formatting, and style variability:**  
   Randomize and vary indentation, line breaks, grouping of statements, inlining versus expanded statements, and spacing without violating pseudocode syntax rules.

Your final output should be a fully valid pseudocode rendition that differs as much as possible lexically, structurally, and stylistically while preserving every operational detail and behavioral characteristic of the original.

Output only the transformed pseudocode text, without any additional text or explanation.
