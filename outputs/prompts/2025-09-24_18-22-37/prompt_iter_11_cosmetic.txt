Rewrite the input pseudocode into a new, semantically identical version that matches the original’s behavior exactly in all aspects—outputs, side effects, control flow, logic, and intermediate calculations—across all inputs and edge cases, with zero deviation in functionality. Preserve all function names, class names, and their complete hierarchical organization without renaming or restructuring them.

Your output must consist solely of valid pseudocode text, containing no explanations, comments, annotations, quotes, markdown formatting, or any extraneous content.

To maximize divergence—syntactic, structural, lexical, and stylistic—while guaranteeing flawless equivalence, comprehensively and consistently apply an intelligent, mixed combination of the following advanced transformation strategies throughout the entire pseudocode:

1. **Systematic and consistent renaming of every local variable and parameter:**  
   Generate new, unrelated variable and parameter identifiers, ensuring every instance is renamed uniformly. Do not rename function or class names, nor affect global or external identifiers.

2. **Comprehensive control-flow reshaping and refactoring:**  
   - Convert loop constructs interchangeably: transform FOR-loops into semantically equivalent WHILE-loops and vice versa, including rewriting loop counters, boundaries, and increments creatively, possibly using sentinel values or iterator abstractions.  
   - Recast conditional constructs by interchanging IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH-CASE structures or nested guard clauses; flatten or deepen nested conditions; reorder branches where logic independence is present; distribute or combine condition checks to vary control flow pathways.  
   - Transform early returns into single-exit points or introduce early returns where safe, maintaining identical semantics.

3. **Reorder independent, side-effect-free statements and expressions arbitrarily:**  
   Analyze dependencies thoroughly to rearrange instructions that do not affect each other’s outcomes or program state.

4. **Rich expression and operator transformation:**  
   - Expand complex expressions into sequences of elementary assignments using temporary variables, or merge simple assignments into concise compound expressions.  
   - Replace arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations with equivalent alternatives and logically identical formulations (e.g., use “not equal to” instead of “!=”, “increment by one” instead of “plus one”, “and” ↔ “∧”, “or” ↔ “∨”).  
   - Vary data access syntax illustratively (e.g., switch between `array[index]`, `array.at(index)`, or `element in array with index`) adhering to the pseudocode’s allowed paradigms.  
   - Express numeric literals equivalently, for example using hexadecimal, binary, or decimal representations interchangeably when behaviorally safe and exact.

5. **Data structure iteration and element access variation:**  
   Swap index-based looping for element-based iteration constructs and vice versa; traverse data structures forwards, backwards, or by other logically equivalent sequences; reorder independent data fetches, preserving semantic invariance.

6. **Maintain original function signatures, class names, and hierarchical placements exactly:**  
   Do not rename or reorder any identifiers related to functions, classes, or their inheritance and containment structures.

7. **Preserve all semantic boundaries strictly:**  
   Maintain the exact number and placement of loops, conditionals, and function arguments; avoid substituting multi-step algorithmic procedures with built-in or library shortcuts or semantic simplifications; replicate all intermediate computations explicitly.

8. **Formatting and stylistic randomization without semantic impact:**  
   Randomize indentation, line breaks, statement grouping, and inline versus multiline statement formatting to increase stylistic difference; vary the use of blank lines and spacing patterns freely.

9. **Consistent naming and scoping of introduced temporary variables or helpers:**  
   Ensure all auxiliary variables introduced for transformations have distinct, unambiguous names and are used consistently within their valid scope to prevent confusion or collision.

Your submission should be a fully transformed pseudocode version that is lexically, structurally, and stylistically maximally distinct from the input yet proven to be functionally identical under all test conditions.

Output only the rewritten pseudocode text, nothing else.
