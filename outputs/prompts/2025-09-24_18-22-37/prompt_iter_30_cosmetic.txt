Rewrite the input pseudocode into a functionally equivalent version that differs from the original in lexical choice, syntax, structure, and style as much as possible, while preserving all original behavior, outputs, side effects, function and class names, and the entire class-object hierarchy with their exact signatures and boundaries. Your output must be valid pseudocode and adhere strictly to these rules:

- Retain all function and class names unchanged, keeping them in their original hierarchical positions without alteration or reordering.
- Rename all local variables and parameters consistently to new, unrelated identifiers; do not rename or alter any global names, functions, classes, or their structure.
- Transform control flow thoroughly by applying any combination of the following where applicable and semantics allow, in arbitrary order:
   - Convert FOR loops to WHILE loops and vice versa.
   - Replace IF-ELSE constructs with SWITCH-CASE, guard clauses, nested conditionals, early returns, or consolidated returns.
   - Reorder logically independent conditional branches or code blocks without changing behavior.
   - Flatten nested blocks or nest flat blocks to differ structurally.
- Reorder independent statements, expressions, and subcomputations whenever data and control dependencies permit, ensuring no change in semantic order or logic.
- Rewrite all expressions by either splitting complex expressions into multiple simpler assignments or condensing multiple steps into single compound expressions using temporary variables:
   - Substitute operators with synonyms or logically equivalent forms (e.g. ‘!=’ → ‘not equal to’ or ∧ for logical AND).
   - Change data access styles (e.g. array[index] ⇄ array.at(index)) when valid.
   - Vary numeric literal representations (e.g. use addition instead of direct literals) as long as behavior stays identical.
- Vary data traversal and iteration styles freely:
   - Switch between index-based loops and element-based loops.
   - Change iteration directions and order where semantically safe.
   - Reorder independent accesses or collections traversals.
- Introduce and use new temporary variables or helper constructs liberally, ensuring consistent and unambiguous usage that preserves logic.
- Randomize formatting extensively, including whitespace, indentation, line breaks, and grouping—resulting code should look stylistically distinct but remain valid pseudocode.
- Do NOT apply any semantic shortcuts, algorithmic optimization, or replace explicit computations with built-in functions or library calls.
- Do NOT rename or reorder top-level function or class declarations or modify their signatures or hierarchy.
- Output ONLY the resulting transformed pseudocode text—no explanations, comments, or any text beyond the rewritten pseudocode.

Your goal is to produce pseudocode that, despite being provably functionally identical, is maximally distinct from the input in every lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic dimension.
