Rewrite the given pseudocode preserving all original functions, method names, class names, and their full class-object hierarchies with exact signatures and boundaries unchanged. Your output must be a functionally identical pseudocode solution that, for any valid input, produces the exact same outputs and side effects as the original, without altering semantics or algorithmic logic. Produce a maximally diverse and transformed version of the input pseudocode by applying the following transformations extensively and in arbitrary combinations:

- Rename every local variable and parameter identifier consistently and uniquely to unrelated fresh names. Do not rename or alter any global identifiers, function names, class names, or hierarchy components.

- Thoroughly restructure control flow by mixing and matching transformations such as: converting FOR loops to WHILE loops and vice versa; transforming IF-ELSE constructs into SWITCH-CASE blocks, nested guard conditions, or flattened conditionals; reordering independent branches freely; replacing multiple returns with a single unified return or introducing early returns where logically equivalent.

- Reorder statements, expressions, and computations freely wherever their dependencies permit. Distribute or consolidate compound expressions into multiple sequential assignments or combine sequential assignments into complex expressions, introducing temporary variables as needed with unique fresh names.

- Replace operators and constructs with logically equivalent variants, for example: negate or rewrite comparisons with semantic synonyms (“!=” → “NOT EQUAL TO”); swap Boolean operators with Unicode/logical symbols (e.g., AND → ∧, OR → ∨); transform array or collection access into alternative valid access styles (e.g., `array[index]` ⇄ `array.at(index)`); change numeric literals representation while preserving value (e.g., 10 → 5×2).

- Vary iteration and traversal paradigms on data structures: transform index-based loops into element-based iterations and vice versa; change iteration order or direction (e.g., ascending to descending) without altering program logic; reorder independent data accesses and handle collection mutation carefully.

- Randomize all formatting details such as line breaks, indentation style, spacing, code block grouping, and statement chaining, as long as the pseudocode remains valid and unambiguous.

- Introduce as many new helper variables, flags, or intermediate constructs as needed, ensuring consistent and unambiguous usage throughout the pseudocode.

- Must avoid any form of semantic or algorithmic simplification, optimization, or shortcuts including the use of built-in functions, library calls, or constructs that shortcut the explicit stepwise computation dictated by the original pseudocode.

- Do not rename or reorder any function or class declarations. Do not remove or add functions or methods. Do not remove or alter the given signatures or class inheritance hierarchies.

- Output ONLY the restructured pseudocode text. Do not include any explanations, comments, delimiters, or formatting marks besides valid pseudocode syntax.

Your goal: produce an output drastically different in lexical tokens, syntax, structure, and style from the original pseudocode while preserving perfect functional equivalence under all valid inputs. Output ONLY the transformed pseudocode.
