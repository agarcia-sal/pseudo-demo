Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode without any purpose, summary, or explanatory notes. Use clear, natural language that is easy to read and understand. Prefer one-liners, symbolic notation, and abbreviations where possible. It’s acceptable to omit details to keep it compact. Do not include comments or explanations. Format steps as numbered instructions with indentation where needed, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and brevity; produce only the pseudocode. Your function has a 5-second timeout—focus on delivering the best result within this time.
