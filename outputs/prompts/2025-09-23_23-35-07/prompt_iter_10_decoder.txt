Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and highly optimized Python code that exactly preserves all function names, class names, and the precise class/object hierarchy as presented. Your translation must:

- Output **only** the fully functional Python code enclosed within a single code block formatted exactly as:
```python
# translated Python code here
```

- Preserve all method and class signatures, parameters, return types, and logic exactly as specified, without adding, removing, or renaming any elements.

- Prioritize Pythonic constructs and best practices, leveraging efficient built-in functions, standard libraries, comprehensions, generators, and appropriate data structures to maximize clarity, readability, and performance under a strict 5-second runtime constraint.

- Include input validation strictly **only if clearly indicated or implied** by the pseudocode; otherwise, omit it.

- Avoid any comments, debug statements, explanations, or extraneous output; include **nothing outside the code block**.

- Support all typical Python 3 environments and rely only on standard libraries unless pseudocode clearly implies otherwise.

This approach ensures faithful, performant, and clean Python code strictly aligned with the provided pseudocode and structural requirements.
