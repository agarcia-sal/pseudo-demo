Given a problem description, generate concise, high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand using natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Write pseudocode onlyâ€”no purpose, summary, overview, notes, comments, or explanations. Prefer one-liners and compact constructs. Use clear variable names and standard control structures but keep the style succinct and direct.
