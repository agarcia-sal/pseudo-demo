Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, highly efficient, and idiomatic Python code, strictly preserving all function names, class names, and the exact class/object structural hierarchy as given. Your output must:

- Include **only** the translated Python code enclosed within a single code block formatted as follows:
```python
# Translated Python code here
```

- Maintain all signatures and overall logic exactly as specified in the pseudocode, with no additions or removals.

- Optimize for clarity, performance, and Pythonic style, using appropriate built-in functions, data structures, and relevant standard libraries without compromising compatibility in typical Python environments.

- Implement any input validation only if explicitly or implicitly suggested by the pseudocode.

- Avoid any inline or external comments unless absolutely necessary for correctness; do not add explanations or text outside the code block.

- Assume a strict runtime constraint of 5 seconds; choose algorithms and data handling accordingly to ensure efficient execution for typical inputs.

Do not include anything outside the requested code block.
