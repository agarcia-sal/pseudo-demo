Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that strictly preserves all function names, class names, and the original class/object structural hierarchy as specified in the pseudocode. Your code must:

- Be fully enclosed within a single Python code block formatted with triple backticks and the language identifier, like this:

```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

- Avoid adding unnecessary comments or explanations outside this code block.

- Use the most optimal algorithms and Pythonic constructs to ensure execution completes well within the 5-second timeout for typical inputs.

- Leverage any standard Python libraries or packages to improve code clarity and performance, while ensuring compatibility with standard Python environments.

- Maintain fidelity to the pseudocodeâ€™s logic and intent without altering function or class signatures.

- Handle typical input validation internally if implied by the pseudocode.

Do not include any extra text or formatting beyond the requested code block.
