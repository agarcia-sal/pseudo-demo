Given an arbitrary pseudocode input, possibly comprising classes, functions, variables, control structures, and data manipulations, your objective is to determine with absolute certainty whether this pseudocode is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be directly and unambiguously implemented into functioning code that passes **all** unit tests perfectly without any modification, supplementation, correction, or assumption.

---

### Final Definitive Criteria for Full Reproducibility:

You must consider **all** the criteria below and confirm the input pseudocode satisfies every single one. If **any criterion is not fully met, output `0`. Only output `1` if all criteria hold true without exception.**

1. **Complete Definitions and Signatures**  
   - Every function, method, class, or procedure declared anywhere in the pseudocode must be completely defined in the provided snippet—no missing bodies or partial definitions.  
   - Signatures must explicitly specify all input parameters and their expected types or clear roles, as well as return types if applicable.  
   - No references to external code, libraries, or assumed functions allowed unless stated explicitly and fully defined.  
   - The pseudocode must define all components required for execution—partial or stub definitions do not suffice.

2. **Clear, Unambiguous Syntax and Semantics**  
   - The pseudocode must be free from syntax ambiguity: all control structures (loops, conditionals, switch/case, recursion, etc.) have clearly specified conditions, bounds, and termination points.  
   - Recursive functions must have explicit, reachable base cases defined within the pseudocode.  
   - Control flow paths must be comprehensive and mutually exclusive where applicable, with no missing branches or vague logic.

3. **Consistent and Explicit Identifier Usage**  
   - Every variable, function, class, or data structure identifier used must be clearly declared before use and consistently referenced with the exact same name throughout.  
   - No reuse of the same identifier for different entities in overlapping or nested scopes.  
   - Variable scopes and lifetimes are clearly inferable from the pseudocode without assumption.

4. **Variables and Data Structures: Initialization & Type Clarity**  
   - Every variable is initialized or assigned a value before any use in expressions or control flow—no path leads to use of uninitialized variables.  
   - Data types are made explicit or strongly inferable from context (e.g., int, string, list, boolean).  
   - Data structure shapes (e.g., list sizes, map keys/values, matrix dimensions) and modifications are fully specified and well-defined.

5. **Explicit and Exhaustive Edge Case Handling**  
   - All input cases, including empty, minimal, maximal, special, or invalid inputs that would be tested by unit tests must be explicitly handled.  
   - No implicit assumptions that certain inputs will not occur.  
   - Error or exception conditions are clearly accounted for, or behavior under such conditions explicitly stated.

6. **Logical Consistency, No Gaps, No Contradictions**  
   - The pseudocode must contain no conflicting instructions or operations.  
   - It must not omit intermediate computation steps required to produce a correct final output.  
   - No logical shortcuts or "hand-waving" steps allowed—every transformation and decision must be described fully enough to implement.

7. **Free of Runtime or Structural Errors**  
   - No use of undeclared or undefined variables/functions anywhere.  
   - Returns must be consistent with the declared return type and present on all code paths in non-void functions.  
   - Data structure access (arrays, lists, maps) must contain guards or explicit constraints preventing invalid accesses (out-of-bound, null references).  
   - Control flow constructs are properly closed and balanced (no infinite loops without breaks, no partially closed conditionals).

8. **Self-Contained and Independent Implementation**  
   - All needed logic, helper functions, datatype definitions, and components must be included inside the pseudocode.  
   - No calls or references to external modules, runtime features, or libraries not explicitly defined or standard primitives.  
   - The pseudocode stands alone as a complete program fragment.

9. **Guaranteed 100% Unit Test Passing Suitability**  
   - Based on the above criteria and the logic, the pseudocode is sufficient and robust for passing every conceivable unit test related to its specification—no partial correctness or near-misses.  
   - Any doubt or performance shortfall on any subset of tests must cause to output `0`.

10. **Leniency Only for Non-Impactful Stylistic Variations**  
    - Variations in naming conventions, indentation, or minor syntactical phrasing that do not affect logic or completeness are acceptable.  
    - Whitespace, capitalization, or equivalent language constructs are not grounds for rejection.

### Precise Output Instructions:

- Exactly output a single digit **per input pseudocode snippet and in the order received**:
  - Output `1` if the pseudocode satisfies **all** reproducibility criteria perfectly with zero tolerance for omission or ambiguity.  
  - Output `0` if it fails **any** single criterion or leaves any reasonable doubt about correctness or completeness.  
- Output no additional text, explanations, whitespace, or punctuation—only the digit `1` or `0`.  
- Maintain strict correspondence between input pseudocode order and output digit order.

### Recommended Evaluation Procedure (for best accuracy):

1. Parse the entire pseudocode fully, including all nested classes, functions, and helper definitions.  
2. Verify each declared functional unit and variable is completely and explicitly defined.  
3. Confirm function/method signatures contain clear parameter and return information.  
4. Check control flow unambiguity, including loop bounds, conditionals, and recursion bases.  
5. Exhaustively inspect variable initialization and confirm typing clarity.  
6. Analyze handling of all critical edge cases and exceptional inputs.  
7. Detect and reject any logical gaps, contradictions, or missing computational steps.  
8. Validate absence of runtime error causes or structural defects.  
9. Ensure the entire implementation is self-contained with no undeclared dependencies.  
10. Judge the pseudocode’s suitability to unquestionably pass **all** relevant unit tests.  
11. Only if all above rigorously confirmed, output `1`; else output `0`.

### Important Notes:

- The standard is absolute and strict: **any deficiency or ambiguity that might cause even one failing test means output `0`.**  
- Near-perfect or almost reproducible pseudocode that might fail a non-trivial number of tests is rejected.  
- You do not infer or fill missing information from context beyond what is explicitly provided or inferable from unambiguous declarations.  
- The purpose is to simulate whether the pseudocode can *directly* be implemented as-is, not improved or corrected.

#### Example:

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n) RETURNS int  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

Apply this framework to **every** pseudocode input you receive and output exactly one digit (`1` or `0`) per input, reflecting strict reproducibility as defined.

---

**REMEMBER:**  
Output exactly one digit per input pseudocode in input order and nothing else.  
`1` = Fully reproducible: guaranteed to pass all unit tests as-is.  
`0` = Not fully reproducible: will fail or is incomplete/ambiguous.
