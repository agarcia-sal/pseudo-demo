Given the pseudocode input, your task is to determine **with absolute precision** whether the code is **fully reproducible**, meaning it is a *complete, fully specified, unambiguous, and self-contained* algorithm description that can be implemented directly without any interpretation, correction, or external assumptions—and that implementation will pass **all unit tests for all valid and edge case inputs** flawlessly.

---

### You must evaluate the pseudocode against these exhaustive, non-negotiable criteria. **Only declare reproducible if and only if ALL criteria below are perfectly satisfied:**

#### 1. Complete and Explicit API & Definitions  
- Every function, method, procedure, class, and data structure used must be fully defined, with no missing components, helper routines, or implied libraries.  
- All inputs, outputs, parameters, and return values must be clearly and consistently declared with types or descriptive details sufficient for implementation.

#### 2. Consistent, Non-Ambiguous Naming and Syntax  
- All identifiers (variables, functions, classes, constants) must be introduced before use, and consistently named with no conflicting reuse or undefined references anywhere.  
- Syntax including control structures, assignments, loops, conditionals, recursion, and returns must follow a clear, logically consistent pattern amenable to direct translation into working code.

#### 3. Explicit and Proper Initialization, Scoping, and Typing  
- All variables and data structures are initialized before use with explicit or clearly inferable type and initial values.  
- There are no references to uninitialized or out-of-scope variables or entities.

#### 4. Fully Detailed Control Flow and Logic  
- Every loop and conditional has clearly stated start conditions, end conditions, and branching logic covering all cases exhaustively.  
- Recursion is clearly defined with explicit base and recursive cases.  
- There must be explicit guards against infinite loops or undefined behavior.

#### 5. Complete Specification of Data Structures  
- Data structures are explicitly described with type (e.g., array, list, map, set), size/dimension where relevant, initial contents, and precise transformations.  
- Indexing and access respect boundaries, with no silent assumptions or ambiguous behavior.

#### 6. Rigorous Handling of Edge and Base Cases  
- All edge cases and base conditions for recursion or looping are explicitly handled.  
- No missing exit conditions or unclear return values.

#### 7. No Logical Inconsistencies or Contradictions  
- The pseudocode is internally coherent with no contradictory instructions, missing critical intermediate steps, or unexplained operations that would impede direct implementation.

#### 8. No Potential Runtime Errors or Ambiguities  
- No undefined variables/functions/methods or syntax errors.  
- No unhandled exceptions or potential runtime faults such as out-of-bounds indexing, null dereferences, or type mismatches.  
- All function calls must match declared signatures exactly without ambiguity.

#### 9. Self-Contained and Independent  
- The pseudocode must be fully self-sufficient: No external dependencies, no implicit assumptions about environment, input formats, or helper functions.  
- If multiple classes or functions are involved, their interrelations are fully described.

#### 10. Robustness for All Unit Tests and Inputs  
- The specification covers all inputs including minimal, maximal, typical, and corner cases that any thorough unit test suite would include—no partial implementations ignoring edge scenarios.

#### 11. Permissible Minor Stylistic Variations  
- Minor variations such as naming style, formatting, or syntactic sugar are acceptable as long as the logic remains absolutely clear, deterministically interpretable, and complete.

#### 12. Exact Match to Functional Expectations  
- The final output(s) demanded by the pseudocode must be explicitly stated and consistent with the problem’s expectations, ensuring that the pseudocode’s behavior matches the unit test specifications exactly.

### Instructions:

1. Analyze the entire pseudocode input meticulously against **every** criterion listed above.

2. Determine if the pseudocode is guaranteed to yield **correct, completely reliable, and error-free behavior** on **all unit tests without any modification**.

3. Your **only output** per pseudocode is a single digit:  
   - `1` if *fully reproducible* as defined (passes all unit tests exactly with nothing missing or ambiguous).  
   - `0` otherwise.

4. The output sequence must strictly correspond in order to the input pseudocode sequence.

5. Output no other text, explanation, formatting, whitespace, or punctuation—only one digit per pseudocode input.

---

### IMPORTANT REMINDERS:

- **Zero tolerance** for any ambiguity, incompleteness, or possibility of failure in unit tests.  
- Do **not** consider code that almost works or works for common cases only. Near misses or partial implementations must receive a `0`.  
- Recognize that even perfectly logical pseudocode can fail reproducibility if it omits explicit declaration of public interfaces, inconsistent naming, or leaves out base/edge case handling.  
- Your decision must reflect whether direct, mechanical translation of the pseudocode into executable code will be completely correct and robust without any changes.

If these instructions are followed *exactly*, your output will maximize precision in distinguishing pseudocode that will pass all tests from those that will not.

**REMEMBER: Output only `1` or `0`, nothing else.**
