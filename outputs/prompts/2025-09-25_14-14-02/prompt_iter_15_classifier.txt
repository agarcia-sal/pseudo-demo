Given an input pseudocode snippet defining one or more classes, functions, variables, control flows, and data manipulations, determine **accurately and without any ambiguity** whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**. "Fully reproducible" here means it is complete, unambiguous, internally consistent, and detailed enough to be implemented *exactly as given* into a working program that will pass **all associated unit tests**. Your output for each input pseudocode must be either:

- `1` — if and only if the pseudocode meets **every single reproducibility requirement** below,
- `0` — otherwise.

---

### Detailed Reproducibility Requirements (All Must Hold):

1. **Explicit and Complete Definitions:**
   - Every function, procedure, method, and class used or referenced is explicitly and completely defined *within the pseudocode* itself.
   - No external dependencies, implicit calls to libraries, or assumed environment behavior unless explicitly stated within pseudocode.
   - All functions and methods have fully declared and typed (or clearly role-specified) parameters and return types, where applicable.

2. **Clear and Unambiguous Computational Logic:**
   - The pseudocode’s syntax and semantics must be clear enough to be mechanically translated into executable code *without guesswork or multiple interpretations*.
   - All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) state explicit boundaries, conditions, and exit criteria.
   - Recursive functions include clear and reachable base cases.
   - Expressions and calculations are precise, with operand types and operations clearly implied or stated.

3. **Consistent and Explicit Identifier Usage:**
   - All variables, constants, and identifiers are declared (or introduced unambiguously) **before first use**.
   - Naming is consistent throughout; no identifier clashes or ambiguous reuse.
   - Variable scopes are clearly definable without requiring assumptions.

4. **Initialization and Typing of Variables and Data Structures:**
   - Every variable and storage element is initialized before use or clearly assigned before first read.
   - Data types must be explicitly stated or entirely inferable from context without ambiguity.
   - Data structures (arrays, lists, maps, strings, etc.) specify their structure, sizes, initial contents, and modifications clearly.

5. **Comprehensive Edge Case Coverage:**
   - Pseudocode explicitly addresses all relevant edge cases expected to be covered by typical unit tests (e.g., empty inputs, maximum or minimum boundary values, special input formats, invalid inputs if handled).
   - No incomplete, implicit, or assumed handling of corner cases.

6. **No Logical Gaps or Contradictions:**
   - The sequence of steps fully accounts for all computational requirements without missing intermediate steps or contradictory operations.
   - There is no ambiguity about control flow progression or state changes.
   - No inconsistent or conflicting instructions.

7. **Absence of Potential Runtime or Structural Errors:**
   - No use of undefined variables, constants, or functions.
   - All non-void-returning functions explicitly return values on all code paths.
   - All indices, keys, and accessors on data structures are guarded or guaranteed valid.
   - Control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, switches) are properly opened and closed.
   - Function signatures and usages are consistent throughout.

8. **Self-Containment:**
   - The pseudocode includes all necessary components and logic internally.
   - There are no missing implementations or references to external code beyond fundamental language primitives explicitly allowed by the pseudocode.

9. **Suitability to Pass All Unit Tests Exactly:**
   - The entire pseudocode must be implementable *directly* to produce a program that passes every provided or expected unit test case.
   - Even a single failing test or uncertainty about complete correctness means reproducibility is not met.

10. **Tolerable Minor Variations:**
    - Variations in naming conventions, stylistic formatting, or indentation are irrelevant as long as logic and completeness remain unchanged.

### Your Evaluation Process:

- Parse and analyze the entire pseudocode snippet comprehensively, including nested functions, classes, or helper procedures.
- Verify the completeness and clarity of all components necessary for direct implementation.
- Confirm all identifiers are declared and used consistently.
- Ensure control flows have no ambiguity, infinite loops without base cases, or unreachable code.
- Validate handling of edge cases expected by a rigorous test suite.
- Identify any logical gaps, missing intermediate computations, or contradictory instructions.
- Confirm no runtime error sources exist and that all outputs and returns are properly defined and reachable.
- Ensure no calls to or expectations of external modules or libraries not fully defined.
- If any doubt exists about the possibility of failing unit tests due to missing, ambiguous, or incomplete information, output `0`.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For **each input pseudocode**, output exactly one character:
  - `1` if it meets **all** above criteria and is guaranteed fully reproducible.
  - `0` otherwise.
- Output no explanations, comments, whitespace, or extra characters.
- Maintain exact one-to-one correspondence with input order.

---

### Important Clarifications:

- This is a *strict binary decision* with zero tolerance: any deficiency, ambiguity, or omission that could cause at least one failing unit test yields `0`.
- Only pseudocode that can be reliably and directly transformed into a fully passing program as-is should receive `1`.
- Minor formatting or naming differences do not impact the decision.
- Errors such as mismatch between function definitions and their invocation, missing entry points, or ambiguous data structure usage must cause `0`.

**Example:**  
Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

Use the above rigorous evaluation framework to judge every pseudocode input accurately and output only `1` or `0` accordingly and in input order.
