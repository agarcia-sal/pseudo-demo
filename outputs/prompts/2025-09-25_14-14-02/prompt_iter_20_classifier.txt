Given an arbitrary pseudocode input which may define one or more classes, functions, variables, control structures, and data manipulations, your task is to decisively determine if this pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, meaning it can be directly and unambiguously implemented as-is into a fully working program that passes **all** unit tests without any corrections, extensions, or assumptions.

---

### Output Instructions:

- For **each** pseudocode input, output exactly one digit:
  - **`1`** if the pseudocode meets the full reproducibility criteria defined below.
  - **`0`** otherwise.
- Output only the digit, nothing else—no explanations, no whitespace, no punctuation.
- Outputs must preserve the exact order of the input pseudocodes.

---

### Full Reproducibility Definition and Criteria:

Your decision must be zero-tolerance strict: **Any** shortcoming causing even a single unit test failure mandates output `0`. Only perfectly explicit, logically complete, and syntactically clear pseudocode warrants output `1`.

#### 1. Complete and Explicit Declarations and Definitions:
- **All** functions, procedures, methods, and classes invoked must be fully declared and defined **within** the given pseudocode.
- No external, assumed, implicit, or partial definitions allowed.
- All functions/methods must include full signatures: parameters (with explicit or clearly inferred types/roles), and explicit return types if applicable.
- Nested or inner functions must also meet the same standards.

#### 2. Unambiguous, Deterministic Control Flow:
- All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion, branches) must clearly specify:
  - Loop bounds or termination conditions, ensuring no infinite loops.
  - Complete coverage of branches with no missing or ill-defined conditions.
  - Recursion must always have reachable base cases.
- Logical operators, flow decisions, and exit points must be explicit and free of ambiguity.

#### 3. Consistent and Complete Identifiers:
- Every variable, constant, function, class, or type identifier is **declared before use**, and names are used consistently without conflict or ambiguity.
- Variable and function scopes must be clearly indicated or inferable.
- Reused identifiers across different scopes must not cause confusion or overwrites.

#### 4. Explicit Initialization and Clear Typing:
- Variables and data structures are always initialized explicitly before their first use.
- Data types must be stated or clearly implied with no ambiguity. Type conversions must be defined or unnecessary.
- Data structures include type, dimensions, and any initial contents clearly described.
- Operations on data structures (indexing, inserting, removing) must be safe and guarded against invalid access.

#### 5. Exhaustive Edge Case Handling:
- All expected input variations, including boundary and exceptional cases (empty inputs, minimal/maximum values, invalid formats), must be accounted for explicitly.
- No implicit assumptions about input characteristics.
- Partial or vague handling of edge cases disqualifies reproducibility.

#### 6. Logical Completeness, No Contradictions:
- Pseudocode cannot contain contradictory statements or logically incomplete sections.
- Computational steps are fully elaborated; no skipped calculations, no undefined intermediate variables.
- No shortcuts that rely on external knowledge or presumed environment.

#### 7. Runtime and Structural Safety:
- No usage of undefined or undeclared variables, functions, or data structures.
- Control structures must be properly closed and syntactically well-formed.
- Function return paths must always yield a value if a return type is specified.
- Data accesses must never be out-of-bounds or undefined.
- Consistent application of function/method signatures throughout.

#### 8. Fully Self-Contained Implementation:
- Pseudocode must not call or depend on external libraries, modules, or runtime features beyond fundamental language primitives.
- All auxiliary logic, helper functions, or utilities must be included explicitly inside the pseudocode.

#### 9. Robustness for Passing Every Unit Test:
- The presented pseudocode should be sufficient to guarantee successful passing of an entire suite of unit tests *exactly as given*.
- Partial success, flaky or near-correct behavior (passing only some tests, e.g., ≥80%) is strictly insufficient.
- If there exists *any* plausible failing test case due to ambiguity, incompleteness, or error, output `0`.

#### 10. Allowance for Stylistic and Formatting Variation:
- Differences in naming style, indentation, minor syntactic spelling variations (e.g., `FUNCTION` vs `func`), and superficial formatting **do not** disqualify reproducibility, as long as logical clarity and completeness remain intact.
- Do **not** confuse style issues with correctness or completeness issues.

---

### Evaluation Procedural Guidance (For Internal Reasoning):

- Fully parse all structures: classes, functions, variables, nested blocks.
- Cross-check all invoked functions/methods are declared within pseudocode.
- Validate that all identifiers have prior declaration, consistent naming/usage, and correct scopes.
- Analyze all control flows for termination, coverage, and reachability.
- Confirm every variable and structure initialization before usage.
- Assess edge case handling rigorously.
- Detect and reject any logical contradictions or gaps.
- Validate structural soundness and absence of runtime risks.
- Confirm the pseudocode is entirely self-contained, no external dependencies.
- If doubt exists about correctness or test coverage, default to `0`.

### Examples

#### Example 1 - Reproducible
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```
Output:
`1`

#### Example 2 - Not Reproducible (missing function, undefined variables, or ambiguous flow)
Output:
`0`

---

**REMEMBER:** Output is a single digit `1` or `0` only, per pseudocode input, corresponding exactly to the input order.
