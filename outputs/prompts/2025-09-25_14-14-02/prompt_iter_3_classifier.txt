Given the pseudocode input, determine with absolute certainty whether it is **fully reproducible**—meaning that the pseudocode provides a *complete, unambiguous, and self-contained* specification that can be directly implemented without any interpretation, modification, or supplementation, and that will pass **all unit tests** flawlessly.

---

### Your assessment must be grounded in ALL of the following rigorous, unyielding criteria:

- **Complete Definitions**  
  All functions, procedures, methods, and classes mentioned must be fully defined within the pseudocode. No external implied logic, missing functions, or undefined procedures are allowed.

- **Consistent and Explicit Naming**  
  Every identifier (function names, variable names, data structure labels) must be consistently used and explicitly declared or introduced before use. Names in return statements, calls, or iterations must exactly correspond to these definitions internally.

- **Variables and Initialization**  
  All variables must be explicitly initialized or assigned before usage. Their types, scopes, and initial values should be clear or inferable without guesswork.

- **Clear Control Flow**  
  All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) must specify precise loop bounds, exit conditions, and paths for all branches. No ambiguous or incomplete control logic—every possible case must be covered to avoid runtime errors or logical inconsistencies.

- **Data Structure Details**  
  Data structures must be clearly specified: type/kind (arrays, lists, maps, sets), dimensions, initial states, and transformations on these structures must be explicitly described.

- **Handling Edge/Base Cases and Return Values**  
  Edge cases and base conditions must be handled explicitly, especially for recursive functions. All function exit points and return values must be clearly stated.

- **No Contradictions or Missing Logic**  
  The pseudocode must not contain contradictory instructions, missing intermediate steps, or unexplained operations that impede faithful, direct implementation.

- **No Runtime Errors or Ambiguities**  
  The pseudocode must be free from errors that would cause runtime failures if implemented as-is, including but not limited to:
  - Undefined variables or functions
  - Incorrect or missing syntax for control statements
  - Data structure misuses (e.g., indexing out of bounds without guard)
  - Mismatched or missing return statements
  - Invalid or inconsistent method signatures

- **Robustness for ALL Inputs**  
  The pseudocode must be complete enough to handle all valid and edge-case inputs covered in comprehensive unit tests, not just common or base scenarios.

- **Consistency within Itself**  
  The pseudocode must maintain internal consistency so that all parts coherently interoperate without contradiction or assumption.

- **Minor Stylistic Variations Allowed**  
  Variations in naming style, formatting, or minor syntax differences are not a basis for non-reproducibility, provided the underlying logic remains clear, exact, and unambiguous.

- **Strict 100% Passing Criterion**  
  Any pseudocode that fails to be completely reliable for **every** unit test (even a single failing or unhandled case) is considered non-reproducible.

### Instructions:

1. Analyze the entire pseudocode thoroughly to verify that it meets **all** the above criteria perfectly.

2. Decide if the pseudocode, as given, can be directly translated into working code that will pass every unit test with no modifications, no runtime errors, and no logical gaps.

3. **Output exactly one integer per pseudocode input:**  
   - Output `1` if *fully reproducible*.  
   - Output `0` otherwise.

4. Output **nothing else**—no explanation, no punctuation, no whitespace beyond the single digit.

5. Maintain **strict output order** corresponding to the input order.

### Example

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

Apply this exhaustive, zero-tolerance approach to maximize accuracy when discerning pseudocode that genuinely passes all tests from those that do not, including near misses and superficially similar variations.

---

**REMEMBER:** *ONLY* output `1` or `0` — no other text, formatting, or commentary.
