Given an arbitrary input of pseudocode that may include one or more classes, functions, methods, variables, data structures, control constructs, and computational steps, your task is to evaluate and output a single digit per pseudocode input:  
- **Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode is fully reproducible** — meaning it can be **directly and unambiguously implemented as-is** into correct executable code that will pass **all possible unit tests without any changes, additions, or corrections**.  
- **Otherwise**, output exactly **`0`**.

### Definition of FULL REPRODUCIBILITY (passing **all** unit tests):

A pseudocode input is fully reproducible if and only if **every** of the following conditions is strictly and completely fulfilled:

1. **Complete Explicit Definiteness:**  
   - **All functions, classes, methods, and procedures referenced anywhere are defined explicitly and completely in the pseudocode.**  
   - No implicit or external dependencies, no assumed library or built-in function usage unless explicitly specified as standard language primitive available without definition.  
   - Every function signature fully declares the input parameters (with meaningful identifiers and types/roles clearly indicated or inferable) and expected return types where applicable.

2. **Unambiguous Syntax and Semantics:**  
   - The pseudocode structure (indentations, delimiters, keywords) must be sufficient to translate directly to syntactically valid executable code with **one and only one interpretation**.  
   - Control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion) are explicit: loop ranges and conditions must be fully defined with no ambiguity or missing guard conditions.  
   - Recursive functions include clearly stated and reachable base cases.  
   - All statements and expressions are semantically well-defined and logically complete.

3. **Self-Contained and Consistent Identifiers:**  
   - All variables, functions, classes, and objects are consistently and uniquely named throughout, with no conflicting or ambiguous identifiers.  
   - Each variable is declared or initialized **before use**, and variable lifetimes and scopes are clear or deterministically inferable from the pseudocode.  
   - No identifiers are left dangling or undefined at any point.

4. **Complete Initialization and Type Clarity:**  
   - Variables and data structures are fully and explicitly initialized before usage; no usage of uninitialized or partially defined variables.  
   - Types must be either explicitly declared or clearly inferable without ambiguity (including complex data structures — their dimensions, element types, or contents if initialized must be clear).  
   - Any mutation or modification of variables or structures is stated clearly.

5. **Complete Logical Coverage of Inputs and Edge Cases:**  
   - The pseudocode explicitly handles all normal and edge cases that unit tests could reasonably examine, including but not limited to empty inputs, minimal or maximum bounds, special values, and exceptional conditions.  
   - No conditional branches are left implicit, incomplete, or only partially specified.  
   - No hidden assumptions or neglected cases.

6. **No Logical Gaps, Contradictions, or Missing Steps:**  
   - The logic is fully traceable with no omitted intermediate steps critical to correctness.  
   - There are no contradictory instructions in the same scope or unreachable code.  
   - All control flows and data manipulations are coherent and consistent.

7. **No Runtime Errors or Structural Flaws:**  
   - The pseudocode must be free of constructs that directly cause runtime or structural errors, such as:  
     - Use of undeclared or undefined variables/functions anywhere.  
     - Missing required return statements in functions with non-void outputs.  
     - Invalid or unchecked operations on data structures (e.g., out-of-bound indices without guard).  
     - Improper loop or conditional termination (e.g., infinite loops without breaks, unclosed branches).  
   - Function/method usage and calls match definitions perfectly in parameters and return usage.

8. **Explicit Input/Output and Execution Model:**  
   - The expected input and output interfaces are defined clearly or inferable without ambiguity.  
   - Execution sequences (such as main logic flow or test hooks) are present so the program can be run as intended.

9. **Purely Internal Logic (Self-Containment):**  
   - The entire required implementation is contained within the pseudocode block; no external calls or reliance on missing modules or runtime infrastructure beyond primitive operations explicitly allowed.

10. **Allowance for Non-Logical Stylistic Variations:**  
    - Variations in naming conventions, indentation style, punctuation, or minor formatting are **irrelevant** to reproducibility as long as logical correctness and completeness hold.  
    - The evaluation focuses solely on logical, syntactic, and semantic correctness, not aesthetic style.

### Your OUTPUT RULES:

- For **each pseudocode input**, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` → fully reproducible input, meets **all** criteria above, guaranteed to pass **all** unit tests without change.  
  - `0` → any failure, ambiguity, omission, or plausible cause of partial/failing unit tests.  
- Output no other characters, whitespace, line breaks, punctuation, or commentary.  
- The order of output digits corresponds exactly to the order of the pseudocode inputs received.

### HOW TO ASSESS:

1. **Parse Completely:** Examine every part of the pseudocode, including nested constructs and all definitions.  
2. **Check Definitions:** Confirm every referenced entity has a full explicit definition inline.  
3. **Check Control Flow:** Verify loops, conditionals, and recursion have fully specified conditions, bounds, and execution flows.  
4. **Check Variables:** Validate all variables are declared, initialized, typed (explicitly or inferably), and used correctly and consistently.  
5. **Check Logical Completeness:** Confirm all branches and edge cases that unit tests might cover are explicitly addressed.  
6. **Check for Errors:** Look for any potential runtime or logical errors such as undefined variables/functions, missing returns, invalid index accesses, infinite unbreakable loops, or contradictory statements.  
7. **Check Self-Containment:** Ensure no external code, libraries, or assumed standard functions not defined or clearly stated as primitives are required.  
8. **Check Output Handling:** Outputs and return values must be specified clearly to satisfy all expected scenarios.  
9. **If there is any doubt or ambiguity — output `0`.**

---

### STRICTNESS NOTES:

- This is a **zero-tolerance** test. Even a single overlooked edge case or ambiguous detail that could cause any unit test to fail mandates outputting `0`.  
- Only **perfectly complete, explicit, and unambiguously correct pseudocode** gets `1`.  
- Near-misses, partial implementations, assumptions, or incomplete logic get `0`.

### EXAMPLE:

**Input:**  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

**Output:**  
`1`

---

### REMINDER:

- You MUST output **ONLY** a single digit (`1` or `0`) per pseudocode input, no text, no explanation.  
- Output order must correspond **exactly** to the input order.  
- Be thorough, strict, and unambiguous in your judgment.

Use these instructions to rigorously evaluate **any** pseudocode input and produce the binary reproducibility output with maximal accuracy and precision.
