Given the input pseudocode, determine with absolute rigor and no exceptions whether it is **entirely reproducible**—meaning it defines a *precise, comprehensive, unambiguous, and self-contained* algorithmic specification that can be implemented verbatim without any external assumptions, corrections, or clarifications, and that will succeed in passing **every applicable unit test** without fail.

### You must evaluate against ALL these mandatory, strict criteria:

1. **Complete Structural Definitions**  
   - Every class, function, method, or procedure referenced is completely and explicitly defined within the pseudocode.  
   - No reliance on implicit base methods, external libraries, or unstated helper functions.

2. **Strict Naming Consistency & Declaration**  
   - Every variable, function, parameter, and data structure is clearly introduced before use, with consistent naming throughout all occurrences.  
   - Identifiers match exactly in calls, returns, and references—no implicit renaming or ambiguous terms.

3. **Explicit Variable Initialization and Type Clarity**  
   - All variables have explicit or clearly inferable initial values or states before their first use.  
   - Variable types (e.g., integer, string, list) are either explicitly stated or unambiguously deducible from context.

4. **Explicit and Exhaustive Control Flow**  
   - All loops specify exact start and end conditions or bounds explicitly.  
   - Conditionals cover all logical branches; no case is left undefined or implicitly assumed.  
   - Recursion bases and edge terminations are fully stated and reachable.

5. **Clear Data Structure Specifications**  
   - Data structures are precisely described: type (array, list, map, set, etc.), size/dimensions, initial contents, and all transformations or updates.  
   - Indexing and element accesses are guarded and fully valid within stated bounds.

6. **Complete Handling of All Edge and Base Cases**  
   - All edge cases within the problem domain are clearly addressed (including empty inputs, minimal/maximal values).  
   - Functions explicitly manage every return path with well-defined return values and types.

7. **No Logical Contradictions or Missing Steps**  
   - The pseudocode never contains conflicting instructions, omitted intermediate computations, or unexplained operations that would inhibit faithful implementation.

8. **Free from Potential Runtime Errors**  
   - No use of undefined identifiers, missing returns, or undefined behavior.  
   - Syntax and structure conform to unambiguous, implementable forms for control statements and expressions.  
   - No out-of-bounds indexing, division by zero, or unhandled exceptions implied.

9. **Complete Input Domain Coverage for Unit Tests**  
   - The specification is sufficiently thorough to correctly handle *every* valid input and edge case that comprehensive unit tests would cover.

10. **Internal Coherence and Self-Containment**  
    - All parts of the pseudocode are consistent with each other—no implicit external assumptions or contradictions.

11. **Allow Minor Stylistic Flexibility**  
    - Tolerate variations in naming conventions, formatting, or minor syntactical differences, **provided that the pseudocode remains logically precise, unambiguous, and fully implementable**.

12. **Strict All-or-Nothing Passing Criterion**  
    - If there exists any valid input for which the specified pseudocode would fail, err, or yield incorrect output, it is deemed *not reproducible*.

### Exact Instructions for Your Judgment:

- Analyze the *entire* input pseudocode carefully against all criteria above, leaving no assumptions or gaps unchecked.  
- Decide if the pseudocode can be translated directly into executable code that will **pass all unit tests perfectly, with zero modification, error, or ambiguity**.  
- Produce exactly one integer output per pseudocode input:  
  - `1` if it is fully reproducible by the above strict definition.  
  - `0` otherwise.

- Output **only** the single digit `1` or `0` for each pseudocode input, with no extra text, explanation, whitespace, or formatting.  
- Maintain output order corresponding exactly to the input order.

---

### Important Clarifications:

- This determination is from a *practical implementation standpoint*: does the pseudocode provide *exactly enough to implement and pass tests without guesswork or extensions?*  
- Do *not* reward partial correctness, near-completeness, or common-sense inference beyond what is explicitly stated.  
- Do *not* penalize superficial variations in style or notations that do not obscure meaning or correctness.  
- If there is any ambiguity, incompleteness, missing definitions, or potential runtime error scenario—even one—you must output `0`.

---

**REMEMBER:** Your response must be strictly a sequence of digits `1` or `0`, no other content, matching the count and order of the pseudocode inputs provided.
