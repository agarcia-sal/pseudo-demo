Given a piece of pseudocode that may include any combination of classes, functions, variables, control structures, and data manipulations, your task is to output **exactly one digit per input** — `1` if the pseudocode is fully reproducible, `0` otherwise.

---

### Definition of Full Reproducibility:

A pseudocode input is **fully reproducible** if and only if it can be *directly and unambiguously implemented* into working code that passes **all unit tests** without any correction, supplementation, or assumptions beyond what is explicitly provided. This includes handling all valid inputs, edge cases, and error conditions precisely and completely.

---

### Evaluation Criteria:

To determine whether a given pseudocode is reproducible (`1`) or not (`0`), apply the following **strict and exhaustive criteria** (failure of any means `0`):

1. **Explicit and Complete Declarations:**  
   - Every function, method, class, or procedure used anywhere must be defined fully and explicitly in the provided pseudocode.  
   - No reliance on or reference to external libraries, undocumented standard functions, or missing submodules.  
   - All function/method signatures must explicitly include parameter names, their types or clear contextual roles, and the return type if applicable.  
   - Overloads or multiple definitions must be complete without ambiguity.

2. **Clear, Unambiguous Syntax and Structure:**  
   - The pseudocode must have a deterministic syntax that can be translated straightforwardly into executable code.  
   - All control flow elements — loops, conditionals, recursion — must explicitly state loop boundaries, exact logical conditions, recursion bases, and exit points.  
   - Recursive functions must include *at least one reachable* base case, explicitly shown.  
   - No implicit meaning or assumptions about operator precedence, variable mutation semantics, or evaluation order.

3. **Consistent and Well-Scoped Naming:**  
   - Every identifier (variable, function, class, constant) is declared before use and consistently named throughout.  
   - No ambiguous reuse or shadowing without clear scoping rules.  
   - Variable scopes must be either explicitly specified or clearly inferable *without assumption*.

4. **Explicit Variable Initialization and Type Information:**  
   - Variables must be initialized prior to use; no use of uninitialized data or values.  
   - Data types must be explicitly stated or be unambiguously inferable from context.  
   - Data structures (arrays, lists, maps) must declare size, element types, initial contents (if any), and modifications clearly.  
   - No undefined conversions or implicit type coercions.

5. **Full Handling of Edge Cases and Inputs:**  
   - The pseudocode must explicitly handle *all* expected input variations, including edge cases like empty inputs, minimum/maximum values, invalid or borderline inputs — as required by typical unit testing for the problem domain.  
   - No paths or inputs left unhandled or partially defined.

6. **Logical Completeness and Consistency:**  
   - No gaps or missing intermediate computations; all computational steps necessary for correctness are shown or defined.  
   - No internal contradictions or conflicting instructions.  
   - Control flows have no unreachable branches or infinite loops without exit.

7. **Freedom from Runtime and Structural Errors:**  
   - No use of undefined variables or functions in any path.  
   - All non-void functions include consistent return statements in all control paths.  
   - No out-of-bounds accesses or illegal operations without protective conditions.  
   - No malformed or incomplete constructs (e.g., loops or conditionals left unclosed).

8. **Self-Contained and Independent Implementation:**  
   - The pseudocode is independent of any external code, libraries, or runtime environment except basic language primitives explicitly stated or universally accepted as given.  
   - All needed helper functions or classes are included and fully defined.

9. **Suitable for Passing All Unit Tests Exactly:**  
   - The logic must be robust and correct under all test inputs, without partial passing or near misses.  
   - Any ambiguity, vagueness, or potential logic error leading to failing a single unit test leads to output `0`.

10. **Permitted Flexibility:**  
    - Minor stylistic or formatting differences (naming conventions, indentation, whitespace) *do not* affect reproducibility.  
    - Different but logically equivalent constructions or naming that do not impact correctness or completeness are acceptable.

### Evaluation Procedure:

- Rigorously parse the entire pseudocode, including nested structures and inner definitions.  
- Verify every function and class is fully defined and complete; check that all parameters have types and returns clearly specified.  
- Check all variable declarations and initializations occur before use; ensure data types and structures are explicit or clearly deducible.  
- Examine all control flows: their conditions, loops, recursive calls, and exits for full clarity and completeness.  
- Confirm rigorous handling of all edge or special cases explicitly stated or logically confirmed.  
- Detect no contradictions, missing logic steps, ambiguous or undefined behaviors anywhere.  
- Confirm no dependency on anything external beyond standard language constructs clearly included or assumed.  
- If any possible failing unit test or unhandled condition is found, return `0`.  
- Otherwise, return `1`.

---

### Output Requirement:

- Output **exactly one digit (0 or 1) for each pseudocode input**, in the order they are provided.  
- No additional text, whitespace, explanations, or punctuation.  
- The output must be one-to-one with the inputs.

---

### IMPORTANT:

- Apply **zero-tolerance rigor**: *any* ambiguity, missing detail, logical gap, semantic or syntactic defect that *could* cause failure of even a single unit test mandates output `0`.  
- Only perfectly explicit, logically complete, and fully implementable pseudocode should be marked `1`.

---

### Example:

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution
    FUNCTION sumToN(n INT) RETURNS INT
        SET total TO 0
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n
            INCREMENT total BY i
        END FOR
        RETURN total
    END FUNCTION
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

---

Use this framework to evaluate any pseudocode input you receive and output only a single digit: `1` if fully reproducible, else `0`.

**Remember:** Your output is strictly the digit — nothing else.
