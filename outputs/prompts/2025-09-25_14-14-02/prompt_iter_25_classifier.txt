Given an arbitrary input of pseudocode—potentially comprising one or more classes, functions, variables, control structures, and data manipulations—your task is to determine **with absolute certainty** whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, i.e., can be implemented exactly as provided to yield a fully correct program that passes **all unit tests without any change, supplementation, or error correction**.

---

### Your output must be:

- Exactly one digit per input pseudocode:
  - `1` if the pseudocode meets *every* criterion below, meaning it is reliably reproducible.
  - `0` otherwise, if *any* criterion is violated or ambiguous such that any unit test could fail.

**No extra text, explanations, whitespace, punctuation, or formatting beyond this digit.** The output sequence must strictly preserve the input order.

### Comprehensive Criteria for Full Reproducibility Evaluation

**Evaluate with rigorous precision all aspects below. If any doubt or ambiguity arises, assign `0`.**

#### 1. Complete Definitions and Explicit Interface

- All referenced functions, methods, classes, procedures, and data structures must be fully and clearly defined within the pseudocode.
- No references to implicit external libraries, assumed language intrinsics, or omitted foundational components.
- Function/method signatures must explicitly state all parameters, types (or clearly defined roles), and return types as applicable.
- No shorthand or ambiguous declarations allowed.

#### 2. Clear, Unambiguous Control Flow and Logic

- All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion, branching) must specify clear bounds, conditions, and exit criteria eliminating all ambiguity.
- Recursive functions must include fully specified, reachable, and sufficient base cases.
- Logical flow must be complete with no contradictory statements or skipped important steps.

#### 3. Precise and Consistent Naming, Declaration, and Scoping

- Every identifier (variables, functions, classes, objects) must be declared before use, with consistent usage throughout.
- Variable scopes must be deterministically inferable from the pseudocode alone—no assumptions allowed.
- No overlapping or ambiguous names leading to confusion or errors.

#### 4. Exhaustive Initialization and Type Clarity

- Every variable or data structure must have an explicit initialization or default assignment before first use.
- Types must be explicitly stated or unmistakably implied by context, consistent throughout.
- Complex data structures specify their dimension, content type, initial values, and transformations transparently.

#### 5. Explicit Handling of All Relevant Edge and Boundary Cases

- Pseudocode must demonstrate consideration and explicit handling of all typical and edge conditions likely tested by unit tests.
- This includes empty inputs, boundary values, maximal/minimal inputs, invalid or unexpected data forms, and other corner cases.
- No implicit assumptions or missing branches that could cause failures.

#### 6. Absence of Logical Gaps, Contradictions, or Missing Computation Steps

- No missing intermediate computations or returning partial/incomplete results.
- No contradicting instructions or shortcuts that prevent direct, deterministic translation to working code.
- All intermediate results, state updates, and computations must be fully shown or described.

#### 7. Free from Runtime and Structural Execution Errors

- No use of undefined identifiers or functions.
- Proper and consistent matching of return statements for all non-void functions.
- Data structure operations guarded against errors (e.g., out-of-bounds indexing must be prevented or explicitly handled).
- All control block delimiters and loops are properly closed and well-structured.
- Consistent use of function/method signatures and calls.

#### 8. Fully Sufficient and Self-Contained

- The pseudocode contains *all* needed declarations, logic, and supporting components internally.
- No dependencies, calls, or references relying on unspecified external modules, libraries, or runtime environments beyond basic language primitives.

#### 9. Robustness to All Valid Input Variations

- The pseudocode exhibits full correctness and robustness for all valid input ranges expected in typical unit test suites.
- No partial correctness allowed; must handle every plausible tested input fully.

#### 10. Tolerance for Non-Functional Stylistic or Formatting Differences

- Variations in naming conventions, indentation, minor syntax differences, or layout that do not impact semantic correctness are acceptable.
- Only logic, completeness, clarity, and precision matter.

### **Strict Judgement Protocol**

- If *all* criteria above are clearly met without ambiguity, output `1`.
- If *any* criterion is unmet, ambiguous, incomplete, or potentially failing even a single unit test, output `0`.
- Always err on the side of caution: unclear or near-miss cases must be `0`.
- Outputs must align precisely with the input pseudocode sequence.

### Detailed Evaluation Workflow

1. **Parse all definitions and declarations, ensuring completeness.**
2. **Verify signature completeness, parameter clarity, and return consistency.**
3. **Check all control flows for explicit, unambiguous conditions and completions.**
4. **Confirm all identifiers declared, scoped, and consistently referenced.**
5. **Ensure all variables and data structures explicitly initialized prior to use.**
6. **Identify explicit edge case management and error handling.**
7. **Detect no logical contradictions, gaps, or missing computational steps.**
8. **Validate that the pseudocode is fully self-contained and independent.**
9. **Simulate mentally or structurally verify handling of all expected inputs.**
10. **Ignore stylistic or superficial formatting variations.**
11. **If any criterion fails or doubts arise at any point, immediately assign `0`.**

### Example

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

**REMEMBER:** Your output must be ONLY the digit `1` or `0` per given pseudocode input, nothing else, respecting the order of inputs.
