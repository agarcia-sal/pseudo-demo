Given an arbitrary input pseudocode snippet – potentially containing one or more classes, functions, variables, control flow constructs, data manipulations, and nested structures – your goal is to determine, with **absolute certainty and precision**, whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible** as-is, i.e., can be translated directly and completely into correct executable code that passes **every** unit test unambiguously, with no modifications, corrections, or external supplements.

---

### Your Output Requirement:
- For each input pseudocode, output exactly one digit:
  - `1` if the pseudocode satisfies **all** reproducibility criteria below — it can be implemented verbatim and will pass **all** unit tests.
  - `0` otherwise.
- Output **only** the digit. No text, no explanation, no whitespace or punctuation.
- Outputs must be in **exact input order** — one digit per pseudocode input.

### **Comprehensive and Enhanced Criteria for Full Reproducibility**

Assess the pseudocode strictly against all these points:

1. **Self-Contained and Complete Definition**
   - All declared entities (functions, methods, classes, variables, constants, procedures) are fully declared *within* the pseudocode.
   - No external references or dependencies to code, libraries, or functions that are neither explicitly defined nor clearly stated as language primitives.
   - All functions and methods include complete signatures: names, all parameters (with clear types or unambiguous roles), and return types as applicable.
   - All nested calls are resolvable internally.
   
2. **Unambiguous Syntax and Semantics**
   - The pseudocode provides clear, precise, and unambiguous control flow:
     - Loop bounds or iteration conditions are specific and well-defined.
     - Conditional branching logic (if/else/switch) exhaustively covers all cases with no implicit fallthrough or missing branches.
     - Recursion must include clearly defined, reachable base cases.
   - Operators, assignments, and expressions are explicitly specified without vague or undefined semantics.
   
3. **Consistent, Clear, and Complete Naming and Scoping**
   - Every identifier (variable, function, class, etc.) is introduced before usage.
   - Names are consistently used and have a unique, unambiguous referent within their scope.
   - Variable scope must be clearly and explicitly implied by the pseudocode structure.
   - No shadowing or conflicting declarations that introduce ambiguity.
   
4. **Explicit and Safe Data Handling**
   - All variables are explicitly initialized or assigned before use.
   - Data types are clearly stated or logically inferable without ambiguity. Implicit or inferred types must be unambiguous.
   - Data structures (arrays, lists, maps, etc.) specify sizes/dimensions or resizing logic, and their contents are clearly described.
   - Indexing and data manipulations avoid out-of-bounds errors; boundary checks or guards must be explicit.
   
5. **Exhaustive Edge and Corner Case Handling**
   - Pseudocode must explicitly handle all normal, boundary, empty, and exceptional cases that could occur as per typical or implied unit testing.
   - No branches or conditions left open or unspecified that could cause test failures.
   
6. **No Logical or Structural Defects**
   - No conflicting instructions or missing computational steps.
   - No hidden assumptions, shortcuts, or vague references (`TODO`, `assume`, `...`, or incomplete procedure descriptions).
   - Intermediate computations must be fully stated or clearly encapsulated.
   
7. **Complete and Consistent Control Flows**
   - All loops and conditionals properly close.
   - All functions/methods consistently return expected types in all code paths.
   - No unreachable code or infinite loops without exit paths.
   
8. **Absolute Robustness to Unit Tests**
   - The pseudocode must be suitable to pass **all** unit tests fully—no partial credit.
   - If any conceivable unit test input could cause failure, output is `0`.
   - Robust against malformed, minimal, maximal, or unexpected inputs.
   
9. **Formatting and Style Agnostic**
   - Variations in formatting, indentation, or naming style that do not affect clarity or correctness are allowed.
   - Logical correctness, completeness, and explicitness are paramount.
   
10. **Attribute & Interface Correctness**
    - If pseudocode models classes or objects, methods must be properly declared to be accessible as per typical object-oriented conventions.
    - There should be no missing method declarations, or discrepancies between calls and definitions.
    
11. **Strict Zero-Tolerance Judgement**
    - If **any** of these criteria are not perfectly met, the output must be `0`.
    - There is no "almost reproducible" category; fractional correctness does not qualify.

### **How to Evaluate — Step-by-Step**

- Parse the entire pseudocode from start to end, including all nested constructs.
- Verify all declared functions/methods/classes exist and are fully defined.
- Check each variable and data structure for:
  - Explicit declaration and initialization before use.
  - Consistent types and no ambiguous or missing type info.
- Validate control flows:
  - All loops and recursion have valid exit conditions.
  - All branching is exhaustive and unambiguous.
- Confirm edge cases and exceptional inputs are addressed, either by explicit handling or encompassing logic.
- Confirm no contradictory, incomplete, or missing logic sections.
- Confirm method and function signatures are used consistently without discrepancies.
- Confirm class and object method accessibility matches typical conventions (i.e., no missing methods causing runtime attribute errors).
- Confirm no reference to undefined identifiers or missing methods (e.g., no `"AttributeError"`-equivalent issue).
- Disregard cosmetic stylistic differences (case, indentation, variable naming) but not logical/structural deficiencies.
- If in doubt about any potential unit test failure or reproducibility issue, classify as `0`.

### **EXAMPLE**

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

**Remember:** Your output per pseudocode input is exactly one digit (either `1` or `0`), representing **full reproducibility** or **not**, strictly following the above criteria, with no exceptions or elaborations.

This enhanced evaluation framework balances rigorous correctness checks with practical considerations of completeness and explicitness, thereby increasing accuracy, especially in distinguishing near-misses, cosmetic variations, and truly irreproducible pseudocode. Use this as your ultimate guide to deliver precise, zero-tolerance reproducibility decisions.
