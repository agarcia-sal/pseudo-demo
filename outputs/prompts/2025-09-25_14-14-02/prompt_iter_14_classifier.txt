Given an arbitrary input of pseudocode encapsulating any combination of classes, functions, methods, variables, control flows, and data manipulations, your goal is to determine **with absolute certainty** whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**—meaning it can be directly, unambiguously translated and implemented **exactly as provided** into a working program that passes **all unit tests** with zero failures, without any modifications, corrections, or external dependencies beyond standard language constructs.

---

### Precise and Rigorous Criteria for Full Reproducibility:

1. **Self-Contained Completeness:**
   - Every referenced function, method, class, procedure, or data structure is explicitly and fully defined **inside the pseudocode**.
   - No reliance on external code, assumptions about language built-ins, nor implicit environment features except universally accepted basic primitives (e.g., basic arithmetic, control constructs).
   - All helper functions, nested or otherwise, must be fully present and complete.
   - All input and output specifications must be clear and usable as-is.

2. **Explicit and Unambiguous Declarations:**
   - Every variable, parameter, return type, and data structure must be clearly declared or their types/roles unambiguously inferable.
   - Function/method signatures must list all parameters, their types (or clear semantic meaning), and return types if applicable.
   - No undeclared or inconsistently used identifiers.
   - Scopes and lifetimes of variables and functions must be clearly evident, with no assumptions or guesswork needed.

3. **Deterministic Control Flow:**
   - All control flows—loops (for, while), conditionals, recursive calls—must be fully specified, including:
     - Precise loop bounds or terminating conditions.
     - Clearly defined, reachable base cases for recursion.
     - Well-formed branches covering **all** logical possibilities without gaps.
   - No ambiguous or incomplete logic that would introduce multiple interpretations or non-terminating behavior.

4. **Complete Initialization and Consistent Usage:**
   - All variables and data structures are initialized before use.
   - Types and state changes are consistently and explicitly handled.
   - No use of uninitialized, null, or indeterminate state variables.
   - Data structures (arrays, lists, maps, etc.) explicitly specify dimensions, contents, and allowed operations.
   - All updates and modifications to data are precisely detailed.

5. **Comprehensive Edge Case Handling:**
   - The pseudocode explicitly addresses all edge and corner cases expected in rigorous unit testing:
     - Empty inputs or zero-sized structures.
     - Maximal or minimal input values.
     - Boundary conditions (e.g., off-by-one considerations).
     - Error or exceptional conditions.
   - No silent assumptions or missing logical checks.

6. **Logical Consistency and No Contradictions:**
   - No contradictory statements or instructions.
   - No missing intermediate steps necessary for correct result computation.
   - All data transformations and flows form a coherent pipeline from input to output.
   - No partial logic or shortcuts that omit essential computation or validation.

7. **Freedom from Runtime or Structural Errors:**
   - No possible runtime errors such as:
     - Use of undefined identifiers.
     - Inconsistent function signatures or missing returns.
     - Out-of-bounds data access without explicit guards.
     - Broken loops or conditionals lacking proper closure.
   - All function calls respect the signatures and are consistent in usage.
   - Recursive calls or iterations terminate properly.

8. **Guaranteed 100% Unit Test Pass Rate:**
   - The pseudocode as-is is sufficient to produce fully correct, passing results **for every unit test** without needing corrections or clarifications.
   - Partial correctness or near successes are insufficient—strict binary judgement.

9. **Explicit Implementation Context:**
   - All program components necessary for implementation are provided, including class definitions, constructors if needed, and appropriate entry points.
   - Input/output interfaces or API contracts are documented or derivable.
   - No assumed runtime magic, implicit environment variables, or hidden state.

10. **Tolerance for Non-Impactful Style Variations:**
    - Naming conventions, indentation, white space, or minor syntactic differences that do not cause ambiguity or incomplete understanding are permissible.
    - Focus is solely on logical clarity, completeness, and implementability.

### Your Task:

- Given each input pseudocode snippet, output **exactly one digit** per snippet:
  - `1` if and only if the pseudocode satisfies **all** the criteria above and can be directly implemented to pass **all unit tests perfectly**.
  - `0` if the pseudocode fails **any one criterion**, including subtle logical gaps, missing explicit steps, ambiguous control flow, or incomplete declarations.

- The outputs must be in the same order as the pseudocode inputs.

- No additional text, explanations, whitespace, or formatting—only a single digit `1` or `0` per input.

---

### Detailed Evaluation Procedure:

1. **Parse Entire Pseudocode Fully:**
   - Including nested structures, helper functions, classes, closures if any.
   - Capture all declarations, signatures, and bodies.

2. **Validate Completeness:**
   - Confirm every identifier is declared explicitly or clearly inferable.
   - Confirm entire program logic is present with no missing pieces.

3. **Confirm Control Flow Determinism and Termination:**
   - Check loops for definite ranges and conditions.
   - Verify recursion base cases are explicit and reachable.

4. **Check Variable Initialization and Type Correctness:**
   - Ensure all variables are assigned valid initial values before usage.
   - Data types or roles are expressed clearly or unambiguously implied.

5. **Test Edge Cases Coverage:**
   - Confirm branches handle typical, empty, boundary, and exceptional inputs explicitly.

6. **Check for Logical Soundness:**
   - No contradictions or vagueness.
   - All intermediate logic required for correct output is present without shortcuts.

7. **Ensure Implementation-Ready Structure:**
   - All needed constructs (classes, functions, entry points) are present.
   - No missing function or class definitions.
   - Signatures and uses are perfectly matched.

8. **Reject Any Ambiguity or Doubt:**
   - If any ambiguity remains about correctness or passing all tests, output `0`.

---

### IMPORTANT:

- Use a **zero-tolerance policy:** Any imperfection or omission that could cause even a single unit test failure mandates output `0`.
- Only **perfect**, **fully explicit**, and **immediately translatable** pseudocode earning pass on every test is assigned `1`.
- Your responses must be strictly the digit outputs; do not output anything else.

**Example input:**  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

**Example output:**  
`1`

**Remember:** Your output is a **sequence of digits**, each representing the reproducibility verdict of the corresponding input pseudocode snippet, no extras or deviations.
