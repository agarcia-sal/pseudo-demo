Given any input pseudocode (which may include one or multiple classes, functions, methods, variables, control flows, recursion, and data manipulations), your task is to determine and output a single digit per pseudocode snippet as follows:

- Output **`1`** if and only if the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**: that is, it can be translated as-is into an implemented program that would pass **all** the unit tests for its specified problem without any changes, assumptions, or additional information.
- Otherwise, output **`0`**.

---

### Definition of Full Reproducibility:

Full reproducibility means the pseudocode meets **every** criterion below to a strict, absolute standard—there is zero tolerance for ambiguity, omission, or possible test failure due to the pseudocode content.

---

### Fundamental Criteria for 100% Reproducibility

1. **Complete and Fully Self-Contained Definitions**
   - All referenced functions, methods, classes, procedures, and variables must be explicitly declared and fully defined within the pseudocode.
   - No references or calls to external, implicit, or assumed code beyond standard, universally understood language primitives.
   - Function/method/class signatures include **all** parameters with clear names and types or roles, plus explicit return types or outcomes.

2. **Fully Explicit and Clear Syntax and Semantics**
   - Control flows such as loops, conditionals, recursion, and branching must explicitly state all conditions, bounds, increments/decrements, and termination criteria.
   - Recursion must specify clear, reachable base cases.
   - There should be no partially implied, underspecified, or ambiguous statements.
   - Nested blocks and scopes must be clearly delineated and unambiguous.

3. **Consistent, Unambiguous Naming and Scope**
   - Identifiers (variables, functions, classes, parameters) must be declared before use, with consistent and unique names.
   - Variable scopes and lifetimes must be determinable without assumptions.
   - No reuse of identifiers for different purposes within overlapping scopes.

4. **Explicit Initialization and Clear Data Types**
   - Every variable or data structure is initialized or assigned an initial value before any use.
   - Data types must be clearly specified, inferred unambiguously, or explicitly annotated.
   - Data structures must detail their types, sizes/dimensions, and contents (if initialized), as well as all modifications.

5. **Comprehensive Handling of Input Spaces and Edge Cases**
   - The pseudocode must explicitly consider and correctly handle all typical, boundary, edge, and exceptional cases expected by normal unit tests.
   - No missing branches or logic gaps that could cause failures on empty, singleton, maximal, or unusual input values.

6. **Logical and Operational Completeness**
   - No contradictions, logical gaps, or skipped steps.
   - All computational steps needed for the solution are explicitly stated and defined.
   - No shortcuts, placeholders, or omitted key operations.

7. **Error-Free Control Flow and Runtime Safety**
   - There should be no runtime error sources such as undefined variables/functions, mismatched control flows (unclosed loops/branches), or illegal operations (e.g., out-of-bounds access without guard).
   - Functions must always respect their return contract (e.g., non-void functions always return).
   - All function calls use exact matching signatures.

8. **Full Alignment with 100% Unit Test Passability**
   - The pseudocode must be sufficient such that direct implementation would pass **all** unit tests — not a partial or near-complete subset.
   - If there is any plausible failure mode, partial implementation, or unspecified logic that could cause at least one failing test, output `0`.

9. **No External Dependencies or Assumptions Beyond Standards**
   - All logic and data manipulation must be self-contained in the pseudocode.
   - No implicit dependencies on unspecified libraries, external code, or runtime environments besides universally accepted primitive operations.

10. **Tolerance for Stylistic Variations Only**
    - Differences in naming conventions, formatting, indentation, or minor syntactic preferences that do **not** affect logic or completeness are acceptable.
    - Focus strictly on correctness, completeness, and clarity of logic.

---

### Evaluation and Output Instructions:

- For **each pseudocode snippet**, produce exactly one output digit on its own line:
  - `1` if the pseudocode is fully reproducible as defined above.
  - `0` otherwise.
- Output digits must appear in the same order as the pseudocode snippets are fed.
- Do **not** output any other text, commentary, explanations, or whitespace besides these digits.

---

### Detailed Analysis Procedure (For Applying the Criteria):

1. **Parse all pseudocode elements fully**, including nested structures.
2. Verify **all referenced components** (functions, classes, variables) are explicitly and fully declared and defined.
3. Confirm **all parameters**, return values, and data types are clearly specified or unambiguously inferable.
4. Trace **all control flows** — ensure loops have bounds, conditionals cover all cases, and recursion includes reachable base cases.
5. Check for **no undeclared, uninitialized, or reused identifiers** in conflicting scopes.
6. Validate that **all variables are assigned valid initial values before use**.
7. Ensure **all edge cases** relevant to typical testing (empty inputs, boundary values, special conditions) are handled explicitly.
8. Detect **no logical contradictions, missing steps, or runtime error risks**.
9. Confirm **function signatures and calls are consistent throughout**.
10. Confirm no calls or dependencies on unspecified external code or functions.
11. Consider stylistic differences irrelevant if logic and completeness hold.
12. If there is **any uncertainty or any potential test failure**, output `0`.

---

### Absolute Zero-Tolerance Policy:

- Even a **single ambiguity, missing detail, implicit assumption, or incomplete logic** is cause for `0`.
- Only flawless, perfectly explicit pseudocode that guarantees unconditional passing of all unit tests without modification should be labeled `1`.

---

**Example**:

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`


---

Use this framework to analyze **any** given pseudocode snippet with strict rigor and output only `1` or `0` accordingly, **in order**, one line per snippet, no extra text.

---

**REMEMBER:**  
Your output is solely the digit per input pseudocode piece, nothing else.  
Your judgment is strict and absolute — the slightest imperfection or potential failure means output `0`.
