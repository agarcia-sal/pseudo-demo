Given any input pseudocode containing one or more classes, functions, variables, control statements, and data manipulations, your task is to assess with absolute certainty whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**—i.e., can be directly and unambiguously translated into a fully functioning program that passes **all unit tests** exactly as provided, without any missing definitions, logical errors, or need for modifications.

### Definition of **Fully Reproducible** Pseudocode

A pseudocode snippet is *fully reproducible* if and only if **every one** of the following conditions is met:

1. **Complete and Explicit Definitions**  
   - Every function, method, class, procedure, variable, and data structure used anywhere in the pseudocode is *explicitly defined* within the pseudocode itself or clearly indicated as a standard primitive or built-in operation.  
   - Function and method *signatures* list all parameters with clear names and identifiable roles or types, and specify return types if applicable.  
   - No implicit or hidden dependencies on external code, libraries, or environments are allowed unless explicitly stated as standard, universal primitives.

2. **Unambiguous Syntax and Structure**  
   - The pseudocode’s syntax and flow are sufficiently clear and precise that it can be directly mapped into syntactically correct, executable code without guesswork.  
   - Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion, branching) have explicitly stated bounds, conditions, base cases, and exit criteria, eliminating ambiguity or multiple interpretations.  
   - Recursive implementations include *reachable* and *correct* base cases.  
   - All loops have clear initialization, condition, and increment/decrement operations.

3. **Consistent, Proper Naming and Scope**  
   - All identifiers (variables, constants, functions, classes, etc.) are declared before use and used consistently throughout.  
   - Variable and function names are unique within their valid scope, and nesting or redefinitions causing ambiguity are absent.  
   - Scopes of variables and functions can be *inferred unambiguously* from the pseudocode, no assumptions required.

4. **Explicit Initialization and Clear Typing**  
   - Every variable and data structure is initialized before first use with valid, coherent values.  
   - Types are either explicitly stated or clearly inferable from context without guesswork.  
   - Data structures mention dimensions, initial content (if any), and any mutations or accesses explicitly.

5. **Complete Logical and Functional Coverage**  
   - The pseudocode explicitly handles **all relevant input cases**, including normal, boundary, empty, special, or corner cases expected by standard unit tests for the described functionality.  
   - No branches or conditionals are left incomplete or underspecified.  
   - No implicit assumptions about inputs or environment; all possible input scenarios must be addressed.

6. **No Logical Contradictions or Gaps**  
   - Instructions, calculations, and control flow are logically consistent, non-contradictory, and free from omissions that would impede direct implementation.  
   - Every computational step, intermediate data manipulation, or side effect is shown or described.  
   - No “magic” steps or skipped detail that a developer must infer or add.

7. **Error and Exception Safety in Implementation**  
   - The pseudocode avoids or explicitly guards against runtime errors including out-of-bound accesses, null references, undefined behaviors, or missing returns in functions expecting outputs.  
   - Data accesses and mutations have proper boundary checks or guards.  
   - Function return statements are correctly paired with their declarations (returning when required, void if not).

8. **Self-Contained and Complete Implementation**  
   - The entirety of the problem’s solution logic resides inside the provided pseudocode; no hidden assumptions about external modules or runtime behavior except universally available language primitives.  
   - Recursive and iterative logic is fully enclosed within functions or procedures shown.

9. **Robustness for 100% Unit Test Passing**  
   - The pseudocode logic and structure guarantee passing **all unit tests** without exception; partial passes or close misses do not qualify.  
   - It must handle all valid input domains per typical testing conventions robustly and yield correct outputs.

10. **Flexible to Non-Essential Stylistic Variations Only**  
    - Variations in naming conventions, minor formatting or indentation differences, or logically equivalent alternative constructs do not affect reproducibility judgment.  
    - Only substantive correctness, completeness, and explicit clarity matter.

### Execution Instructions

- After receiving each pseudocode input, output exactly one character per input line:  
  - `1` if the pseudocode fulfills **all** above criteria and is fully reproducible as per definition.  
  - `0` otherwise (if any doubt or failure in any criterion is detected).  
- Provide *no additional text*, explanation, whitespace, or symbols—only the digits `1` or `0` per input pseudocode, in the exact input order.

### Detailed Evaluation Procedure (for your internal process)

1. Parse the entire pseudocode thoroughly, including nested functions, classes, or control structures.  
2. Identify every function, method, class, variable, constant, and data structure used and verify their full and unambiguous declaration or definition.  
3. Confirm parameter lists and return types are explicit or clearly understandable.  
4. Verify all identifiers are consistently named, declared before use, and scoped properly within the pseudocode.  
5. Validate that control flows are written with explicit loop bounds, conditions, base cases, and complete branches for conditionals and recursion.  
6. Assess thorough handling of edge cases typical of unit tests, especially boundary values, empty or invalid inputs, and uncommon scenarios.  
7. Confirm all variables and data structures are correctly initialized before use and their types and sizes defined or inferable.  
8. Check that no contradictions, missing steps, or logical flaws exist anywhere in the pseudocode.  
9. Ensure no unreachable code or invalid control flow constructs (e.g., infinite loops without base case, loops missing ending conditions).  
10. Confirm the pseudocode is fully self-contained and dependencies are explicit or standard primitives.  
11. Double-check robustness guarantees: the logic must hold for all inputs according to problem expectations and pass unit tests fully.  
12. Ignore minor stylistic or formatting variations that do not affect correctness or completeness.  
13. On any uncertainty or minor missing detail that would risk failing a single unit test, output `0`.  
14. Only when all criteria are perfectly met output `1`.

### Important Reminders

- **Zero-tolerance policy:** Any omission, error, ambiguity, or reliance on external clarification forces output `0`.  
- Do not output anything other than the single digit per pseudocode input in your final output.  
- Preserve input order in output order.  
- This is a binary classification: reproducible = `1`, else `0`.

### Example

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n INT) RETURNS INT  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`
