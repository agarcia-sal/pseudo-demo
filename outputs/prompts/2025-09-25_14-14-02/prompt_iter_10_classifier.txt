Given an input pseudocode snippet that may include any combination of classes, functions, variables, control structures, and data operations, your task is to output exactly one digit per input:

- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode is **fully reproducible** — that is, if it can be implemented precisely as given, without any modification, auxiliary code, or assumptions, to yield a **completely correct and fully working program that passes every unit test in its entirety**.
- Output `0` otherwise.

**Your output must strictly be one digit per pseudocode input, with no additional text, formatting, or explanation. The order of output corresponds one-to-one with pseudocode inputs.**

## Definitive and Comprehensive Criteria for Judging Full Reproducibility:

### 1. **Explicit Self-Containment:**
- The pseudocode must contain **all** logic, data structures, helper functions, subroutines, classes, and declarations needed.
- No calls, references, or dependencies on external libraries, frameworks, or unstated standard functions are allowed unless fully defined or explicitly stated as part of the pseudocode.
- Any standard primitive operations used must be clearly conventional and unambiguous.

### 2. **Complete, Clear, and Explicit Definitions:**
- All identifiers (functions, methods, classes, variables) must have unambiguous, full definitions within the pseudocode.
- Function and method signatures include **all input parameters with clear types or roles**, and any output (return) types or values.
- Nested scopes and classes are fully and explicitly defined.
- No placeholder or incomplete definitions, nor references to “to be implemented” parts.

### 3. **Unambiguous Syntax and Semantics:**
- The pseudocode syntax must be well-formed, cleanly structured and directly translatable to executable code without guesswork.
- All control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) explicitly define:
  - Loop ranges, indices, and boundaries.
  - Branching conditions and all possible branches.
  - Recursive calls include **clearly stated, reachable base cases**.
- Variable assignments and expressions are fully elaborated with no vague operators or meanings.

### 4. **Consistent, Defined, and Scoped Identifiers:**
- Every variable or function used must be declared beforehand, with consistent naming throughout the pseudocode.
- Variable scopes (local, global, class-level) must be clearly inferable.
- No shadowing or conflicting names unless explicitly and clearly handled.

### 5. **Explicit Initialization and Type Clarity:**
- Every variable is initialized before use.
- Data types are either explicitly stated or clearly implied unambiguously by context.
- Data structures specify their contents, types, and any resizing or modifications.
- Constants and literals are clearly represented and unambiguous.

### 6. **Complete Edge Case and Boundary Handling:**
- The pseudocode explicitly handles all edge and corner cases that common unit tests would include, such as:
  - Empty or minimal input.
  - Maximum or boundary input sizes.
  - Exceptional or error cases.
- No implicit assumptions or skipped conditions allowed.

### 7. **Logical Completeness and No Contradictions:**
- All algorithmic steps are completely represented; no skipped computations, missing detail or logical shortcuts.
- No internally conflicting instructions, unreachable code segments, or incomplete branches.
- All returns and outputs are consistently and explicitly handled.

### 8. **No Structural or Runtime Ambiguities or Errors:**
- No undeclared or undefined variables, functions, or classes.
- All functions with non-void return types contain return statements on all execution paths.
- Array or list accesses include explicit bounds checks or otherwise guarantee safe indexing.
- Control structures are properly closed/completed with no hanging or dangling blocks.
- Consistent use of function/method calls matching signatures.

### 9. **Direct Suitability for 100% Unit Test Passing:**
- The pseudocode must be suitable to pass **all unit tests exactly and fully** without need for external fixes or clarifications.
- Near misses or “mostly works” cases are to be marked `0`.
- Your assessment must be zero-tolerance toward any gap that might cause any test failure.

### 10. **Allowance for Style and Formatting Variations:**
- Differences in naming conventions, whitespace, indentation, or equivalent logically valid variations have no effect on determination.
- Minor syntactic variations are permissible as long as logical clarity and correctness are fully preserved.

## Step-By-Step Evaluation Procedure:

1. **Parse the entire pseudocode input fully**, including all nested constructs, classes, and functions.
2. Confirm **all required components are present and complete** — no missing declarations or partial definitions.
3. Verify **all identifiers are declared and used consistently** with clear scope and initialization.
4. Examine all control flows to ensure **explicit conditions, loops, recursion bases, and branches** are fully and clearly stated.
5. Check for **explicit handling of all relevant edge and boundary cases** pertinent to typical unit tests.
6. Search for any **contradictions, undefined variables/functions, missing steps**, or possible runtime errors.
7. Confirm the pseudocode is **robust, logically consistent, fully self-contained**, and encapsulates the total algorithmic solution.
8. Disregard any stylistic differences or syntactical equivalences that do not affect meaning or correctness.
9. If any reasonable doubt exists regarding reproducibility or full test passing, classify as `0`.
10. Otherwise, confidently classify as `1`.

## IMPORTANT FINAL REMINDERS:

- **Output exactly one character per pseudocode snippet: `1` or `0`. No text, no whitespace, no explanation, no punctuation.**
- The output order matches the input order exactly.
- Your classification is strictly Boolean — absolute strictness with zero tolerance for any possible test failure.
- The goal is maximal accuracy in correctly identifying fully reproducible pseudocode versus all others including cosmetic, near-miss, or incomplete implementations.

**Example:**

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

Use this detailed framework **rigorously** to analyze **any pseudocode** you receive and output precisely one digit per input to indicate whether it is fully reproducible into correct, fully test-passing code.

**Remember: Your entire output is just these digits, nothing else.**
