Given a pseudocode input, determine with absolute rigor and certainty whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible** — that is, whether it constitutes a *complete, explicit, self-contained, and unambiguous* specification that can be directly implemented **as-is** to produce working code passing **all provided unit tests without any error, modification, or supplementation**.

---

### Evaluate the pseudocode using these comprehensive, strict validation dimensions, all of which must be met flawlessly:

#### 1. **Complete and Explicit Definitions**  
- Every function, method, class, procedure, or subroutine mentioned anywhere in the pseudocode is fully defined within the given text.  
- No implicit, missing, or externally assumed logic, helper functions, or global state beyond what is included in the pseudocode.  
- If used, all return types and parameters must be explicitly declared or clearly inferable without ambiguity.

#### 2. **Consistent and Precise Identifiers**  
- Every variable, function, type, and data structure name must be introduced before use and consistently referenced by the exact same identifier throughout.  
- Aliases, overloaded names, or ambiguous references disqualify reproducibility.  
- No undeclared, misspelled, or ambiguous identifiers.

#### 3. **Explicit Variable Initialization and Typing**  
- All variables and data structures must be explicitly initialized or assigned initial values before use, or their initial state must be clearly and unambiguously derived from context.  
- Variable types (or clear implicit types given usage context) and scopes must be defined or inferable with zero guesswork.

#### 4. **Unambiguous, Well-Defined Control Flow**  
- Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) must have clearly specified and terminating boundaries and paths with no possibility of infinite loops or undefined branch behavior.  
- All branches and exit conditions must be explicitly detailed and logically consistent, leaving no gaps or implicit assumptions on termination/iteration limits.

#### 5. **Fully Specified Data Structures**  
- Data structures used (arrays, lists, maps, sets, etc.) must have their nature, initial state, sizes/dimensions, allowed operations, and transformations explicitly described.  
- No vague references to "some list" or "array" without defining its characteristics and initialization.

#### 6. **Complete Handling of Edge and Base Cases**  
- Recursive and iterative logic must cover base cases and edge conditions explicitly and unambiguously to ensure proper termination and correctness under all valid inputs.  
- All exit points and return statements for each function/method must be clearly indicated.

#### 7. **No Logical Contradictions or Gaps**  
- The pseudocode must be internally coherent; it must not contain contradictory instructions, omitted intermediate steps vital for correctness, or operations that cannot be conclusively interpreted.  
- No conflicts between data usage, updates, and flow must exist.

#### 8. **Runtime-Error Free by Design**  
- The pseudocode must exclude any possibility of runtime errors when transcribed literally into code:  
  - No use of undefined variables or functions.  
  - No illegal indexing or out-of-bounds access without explicit guards.  
  - No missing or inconsistent return statements or signatures.  
  - Proper handling of data structure mutations.  
  - All operations must be logically valid with respect to type and value domain.

#### 9. **Robust and Exhaustive Input Coverage**  
- The pseudocode must clearly and correctly handle every valid input domain; it must not rely on implicit input constraints or omit handling for edge cases or uncommon input sizes/values represented in the unit tests.

#### 10. **Internal Consistency and Logical Coherence**  
- Different parts (functions, data mutations, flow controls) must work coherently without contradictions or assumptions requiring external knowledge.  
- No parts should rely on unstated preconditions or assumptions violating self-containment.

#### 11. **Neutrality Toward Minor Style/Syntax Variations**  
- Minor stylistic or syntactic differences (e.g., naming conventions, formatting, loop syntax variations) do not affect reproducibility if the logical correctness and completeness remain clear and unambiguous.

#### 12. **Strict Total Pass Criterion**  
- Any pseudocode that cannot be guaranteed to pass **every test case without fail** (no matter how small or edge-case-focused) is considered **not reproducible**.

### Process instructions:

- Perform a meticulous, holistic analysis of the entire pseudocode input against **all** the above criteria without exception.  
- Determine if it can be implemented literally and immediately yields flawless, test-suite-passing code with zero fixes or clarifications.  
- **Output exactly one digit per pseudocode input:**  
  - Output `1` if it is *fully reproducible.*  
  - Output `0` otherwise.  
- Output only the exact digit in sequence corresponding to the input order, with no additional text, whitespace, punctuation, or commentary.  
- No disclaimers, no explanations, no partial judgments allowed.

### Example

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

---

### Key reminders:  
- Assume the unit tests are comprehensive and cover all corner cases.  
- Do not presume any external logic outside the pseudocode provided.  
- When in doubt about completeness or clarity, choose `0` (not reproducible).  
- Only output 0 or 1 — nothing else.

Use this zero-compromise, exhaustive approach to distinctly and reliably discriminate fully test-passing pseudocode from those that are incomplete, ambiguous, or error-prone.
