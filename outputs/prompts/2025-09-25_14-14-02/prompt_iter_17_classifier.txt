Given an arbitrary pseudocode input that may include any number of classes, functions, methods, variables, control constructs, data structures, and algorithmic logic, your task is to determine **with complete and absolute certainty** whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible** as defined below:

---

### Definition of Fully Reproducible Pseudocode

A pseudocode is *fully reproducible* if, and only if, **it can be directly translated, without any modification, correction, or supplementation, into a correct, fully functioning program that passes every unit test for the intended problem domain.**

Passing all unit tests means 100% correctness for all expected inputs, edge cases, and exceptional conditions as would be required by typical comprehensive testing frameworks for the target algorithm or system.

---

### Comprehensive and Exhaustive Criteria for Reproducibility

Evaluate the pseudocode against **every** criterion below to judge reproducibility:

1. **Complete Self-Containment**  
   - All components (functions, methods, classes, constants, types) referenced anywhere must be fully defined and present within the pseudocode.  
   - No references, calls, or dependencies on external, implicit, assumed, or unspecified code or library functions beyond basic language primitives (e.g., arithmetic, comparisons).  
   - No placeholders, comments suggesting TODOs, or missing definitions allowed.

2. **Explicit, Unambiguous Signatures and Declarations**  
   - Every function/method must have clear, fully specified signatures including parameter names, their explicit or clearly inferable types or roles, and return types if applicable.  
   - Variables, constants, and data structures must be declared with explicit types or sufficiently detailed descriptions to avoid ambiguity.  
   - Identifier scopes (local, global, class-level) must be inferable from the pseudocode without assumptions.

3. **Definitive Control Flow Specification**  
   - All loops, conditionals, branching statements, and recursion are completely and precisely described with explicit iteration bounds, termination conditions, base cases (for recursion), and conditional paths.  
   - No ambiguities, unspecified conditions, implicit iterations, or vague constructs that could lead to multiple interpretations.  
   - All loops must clearly indicate their start, end, and step/increment.

4. **Initialization and Usage Consistency**  
   - All variables and data structures are properly initialized or assigned valid values before their first use in any operation.  
   - Variables are not used uninitialized or undefined.  
   - No data structures accessed out-of-bounds or without protective guards explicitly specified.

5. **Logical Completeness and No Gaps**  
   - The code must fully specify every computational step necessary to produce final output(s), no missing intermediate computations or essential logic.  
   - No contradictions, conflicting instructions, or steps that would cause implementation conflicts.  
   - No ambiguous or incomplete algorithmic logic that requires guesswork or correction.

6. **Full Coverage of Edge Cases and Exceptional Conditions**  
   - The pseudocode must explicitly handle all typical and corner cases, e.g., empty inputs, minimal/maximal input sizes, zero/negative values when meaningful, invalid inputs if applicable, and other edge scenarios expected by comprehensive unit tests.  
   - No assumptions that test inputs will never violate boundaries or that error cases can be ignored.

7. **Semantic and Syntactic Precision Sufficient for Direct Implementation**  
   - Pseudocode must be precise enough to be translated into executable code in a straightforward manner without syntactic guesswork or semantic interpretation beyond the described steps.  
   - Minor stylistic or formatting differences (indentation, naming variations, synonymous constructs) are allowed as long as they do not introduce ambiguity or incompleteness.

8. **Consistent and Coherent Naming**  
   - Each identifier (variable, function, class) is uniquely and consistently named throughout and there is no conflicting reuse or ambiguity.  
   - No use-before-declaration or inconsistent references.

9. **Return and Output Clarity**  
   - Every function/method returns values as specified in its signature in every possible execution path (no missing returns in non-void functions).  
   - The final output expression(s) or return statements fully capture the intended program output.

10. **Robustness and Error-Free Structure**  
    - No structural or runtime-error conditions exist: no infinite loops without exit, no dead code, no invalid operations, no broken constructs such as unclosed loops or conditionals.  
    - The flow and logic must guarantee termination or correct recursive base cases.

11. **Zero Tolerance for Any Deficiency Impacting Unit Tests**  
    - If even a single aspect or logical detail is lacking or ambiguous sufficiently to cause any possible unit test failure, classify the pseudocode as non-reproducible (`0`).  
    - Only perfectly complete, explicit, error-free, and fully correct pseudocode earns reproducibility (`1`).

### Instructions for Your Evaluation Process

- Read and parse the complete pseudocode input rigorously as a whole, including all nested blocks and definitions.

- Confirm that it meets *all* the criteria above, paying special attention to subtle semantic completeness and edge-case handling.

- Reject any pseudocode exhibiting: missing declarations, ambiguous/implicit logic, unhandled edge cases, inconsistent naming/usages, partial or missing return paths, potential runtime errors, or external dependencies.

- Accept any minor differences in syntax or style that do not detract from unambiguous, complete, and correct logic.

- If there is **any uncertainty** about the pseudocode passing every conceivable unit test exactly as-is, output `0`.

---

### Output Format

- For **each** pseudocode input provided, output exactly one character on its own line:  
  - `1` if it qualifies as fully reproducible meeting all criteria above.  
  - `0` otherwise.

- Outputs correspond one-to-one and in order with inputs fed to you.

- **No additional text, explanation, whitespace, or punctuation allowed**, only the digits `0` or `1` per line.

### Illustrative Reference

Input pseudocode example:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

---

### Summary

You must be a strict arbiter: only pseudocode that is fully explicit, self-contained, logically complete, and unambiguously sufficient to be directly implemented to pass every unit test **with no exceptions or modifications** should be marked as reproducible (`1`). Every other case must return `0`.

---

**After this prompt receives pseudocode input, respond ONLY with exactly one digit per input pseudocode: `1` for fully reproducible, or `0` otherwise.**  
**Order of outputs must strictly correspond to input order.**
