Given any input pseudocode—including all classes, functions, variables, control flow, and data manipulations—your task is to determine **with absolute certainty** whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible** into a working implementation that **passes every unit test exactly as is**, with zero modifications, additions, or fixes.

---

### Definition of Full Reproducibility

**Full reproducibility means the pseudocode can be directly translated into executable code which:**

- Is **complete** and **self-contained** (no external dependencies or assumed code beyond standard language primitives)
- Has **no ambiguities** or missing information in declarations, types, control flow, and logic
- Correctly handles **all inputs**, **edge cases**, and **error conditions** as verified by passing **100% of all unit tests**
- Is free from any runtime errors, logical inconsistencies, or undefined behaviors
- Uses consistent, valid identifiers and scope management
- Ensures every computational step is specified and executable
- Does not require guesswork, supplementation, or external clarifications

---

### Detailed Criteria to Evaluate Pseudocode:

1. **Complete Explicit Definitions:**
   - All mentioned functions, methods, classes, and procedures must be **fully and explicitly defined** within the pseudocode.
   - No references to external code, undocumented helper functions, or assumed standard libraries unless explicitly defined or universally obvious (e.g., basic arithmetic operators).
   - Functions/methods must include complete parameter lists (with types or clear semantic roles) and return types if applicable.

2. **Syntactic and Semantic Clarity:**
   - Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) must include exact iteration bounds, conditions, and termination criteria.
   - There must be no ambiguous or multiple valid interpretations of any control or data structure.
   - Recursive functions must have **clear, reachable base cases.**

3. **Consistent Naming and Scope:**
   - Every identifier (variable, function, class) must be declared before use.
   - Names must be consistent throughout the pseudocode — no ambiguous redeclarations or shadowing without explicit scope resolution.
   - Variable scopes must be determinable from the pseudocode; no implicit, undocumented scoping assumed.

4. **Explicit Initialization and Type/Structure Clarity:**
   - All variables must be initialized or assigned valid values before usage.
   - Data types, structure dimensions, and contents (for arrays, lists, maps) must be clear, consistent, or explicitly stated.
   - Modifications to data structures and their effects must be fully detailed and unambiguous.

5. **Comprehensive Handling of Edge Cases and Inputs:**
   - The pseudocode must explicitly handle typical, boundary, and exceptional inputs expected during unit testing.
   - No implicit assumptions about input validity or completeness.
   - All control branches, error states, and rare cases must be covered explicitly.

6. **No Logical Gaps, Conflicts, or Omissions:**
   - The pseudocode cannot omit essential computation steps.
   - Instructions must be logically consistent with no contradictions or shortcuts that would prevent complete implementation.
   - Intermediate computations must be explicitly described or inferable with no guesswork.

7. **Error-Free Control Flow and Runtime Safety:**
   - No use of undefined variables or functions.
   - All non-void function paths must have return statements.
   - No illegal data structure operations (e.g., out-of-bound index access without guards).
   - No incomplete or broken control structures.
   - Functions/methods used must conform exactly to their declared signatures.

8. **Self-Containment with No External Dependencies:**
   - Everything needed to implement and run the program is present within the pseudocode.
   - No reliance on unspecified external modules, implicit runtime features, or assumed environment setup.

9. **Sufficiency to Pass All Unit Tests:**
   - If implemented literally and exactly, the code must pass **all provided unit tests**—partial or near-complete solutions count as failures.
   - Code must be robust and behave correctly on all valid input ranges.

10. **Style or Formatting Variations Are Not Penalized:**
    - Variations in naming conventions, indentation, or minor syntax differences that do not affect correctness or clarity must be ignored.
    - Only logical completeness and explicitness matter.

### Required Output:

- For **each pseudocode input**, output **exactly one character**:

  - `1` — if the pseudocode **meets every criterion** of full reproducibility and passes all unit tests exactly as-is.
  - `0` — if it fails **any** criterion, no exceptions.

- Output only the digits, no spaces, explanations, or other characters.
- Maintain strict input-output order correspondence (one digit output per pseudocode input).

---

### Step-by-Step Evaluation Approach:

- Parse the entire pseudocode for all classes, functions, and structures.
- Verify **every name and definition** is fully declared and uniquely identifiable.
- Confirm all variable initializations precede use and types or meanings are unambiguous.
- Check all control flows in detail: loops, conditionals, recursion must be fully defined and bounded.
- Validate explicit handling of all normal and edge input cases; all conditions must be covered.
- Detect any contradictions, missing steps, or runtime error vulnerabilities.
- Ensure the code is self-contained with no external dependency references.
- Evaluate if the pseudocode literally represents a functionally correct, complete program that would pass all unit tests fully.
- If any uncertainty, gap, or possible unit test failure exists, output `0`.

---

### IMPORTANT NOTES:

- **Zero tolerance:** Any flaw causing the failure of even a single unit test or requiring correction means output `0`.
- **No partial credit:** Only flawless, fully defined, and logically perfect pseudocode warrants output `1`.
- Do not provide any explanation or extra output beyond the single digit per input.

### Example:

```
Input pseudocode:  
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS

Output:  
1
```

Use this rigorous standard to strictly classify any input pseudocode's reproducibility with:

```
[exactly one digit per input pseudocode: 1 OR 0]
```

---

**Remember:** Your **only** output per pseudocode input is a single digit: `1` if fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests exactly as given, `0` otherwise. No explanations. No whitespace. No extra characters. Keep output order consistent.
