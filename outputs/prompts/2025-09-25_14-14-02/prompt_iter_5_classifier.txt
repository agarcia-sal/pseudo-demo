Given the input pseudocode, determine with absolute precision whether it is **completely reproducible**, meaning the pseudocode is a *fully self-contained, explicit, unambiguous, and correct* specification that can be implemented *exactly as given* without requiring any assumptions, guesswork, external definitions, or modifications—and that the resulting implementation will pass **100% of the unit tests** flawlessly.

---

### To decide this, rigorously verify that the pseudocode complies with **ALL** the following criteria without exception:

1. **Complete and Explicit Declarations**  
   - Every function, method, class, procedure, or subroutine called or referenced must have a complete, explicit definition within the pseudocode.  
   - There must be no reliance on any external code, implicit knowledge, or assumed libraries.  
   - Return types, parameter lists (including types or sufficient delimiters/annotations), and side effects must be clearly defined.

2. **Consistency and Exact Naming Alignment**  
   - All identifiers (variables, functions, classes, parameters, constants) must be declared before use and maintain consistent naming without typos or shadowing.  
   - The references in calls, returns, conditionals, loops, indexing, and assignments must exactly match their declarations.  
   - Overloaded or polymorphic behavior must be explicitly delineated.

3. **Explicit Variable Initialization and Clear State Management**  
   - All variables and data structures must be initialized explicitly with clearly stated initial values or initialization procedures prior to their first usage.  
   - Variable scopes and lifetimes should be unambiguous and consistent with standard lexical or procedural scoping rules.  
   - Mutable state changes (e.g., in loops or recursive calls) must be clearly described.

4. **Unambiguous, Exhaustive Control Flow Specification**  
   - All loops (for, while, until), conditional branches (if-else, switch, pattern matching) and recursion must specify precise bounds, termination conditions, and all possible execution paths.  
   - No latent infinite loops, ambiguous exit conditions, or partial branch coverage should exist.  
   - Loops that iterate over data must clearly define index ranges (start, end, step).  
   - Recursive functions must have clear base cases and guarantee termination.

5. **Fully Defined Data Structures and Operations**  
   - Data structures — including arrays, lists, maps, sets, tuples, strings, or custom types — must be defined with their types, dimensions, allowed values, and initial states.  
   - Operations modifying data structures (insertions, deletions, updates, lookups) must be explicitly described with clear rules, ensuring no out-of-bounds or invalid accesses.  
   - Any implicit assumptions about data structures or underlying systems must be removed or explicitly detailed.

6. **Complete and Explicit Handling of All Edge Cases**  
   - All boundary, special, or corner cases implied by the problem or testing suite must be clearly handled in the pseudocode.  
   - Especially for recursion, string manipulation, numeric boundaries, empty inputs, or extreme values — these cases must be neither omitted nor delegated beyond what is explicitly expressed.

7. **Clear and Well-Specified Return, Output, and Side Effects**  
   - Every function or procedure must clearly state what it returns or outputs at every exit point.  
   - Return statements must be consistent with declared return types and cover all logical paths.  
   - Side effects (e.g., modifying global or external states) must be clearly described or explicitly ruled out.

8. **No Contradictions, Ambiguities, or Missing Logic Steps**  
   - The pseudocode must be logically coherent internally, with no conflicting instructions or operations.  
   - Intermediate computations, especially those used in subsequent steps, must be defined or derivable unambiguously.  
   - No partial or sketchy steps that require interpretation or “filling-in” by the implementer.

9. **Error-Free Syntax and Semantics by Implementation Standard**  
   - Pseudocode must conform to a consistent and correct syntax style allowing direct translation into working code.  
   - Control statements, assignments, function calls, and expressions must be syntactically valid and semantically sound.  
   - No undefined variables/functions, incorrect parameter usage, mismatched types, or logical fallacies like indexing beyond bounds.

10. **Robustness Across the Entire Input Domain**  
    - The pseudocode must provide complete coverage and correctness for every valid input shape or pattern, including all edge or corner inputs.  
    - It must not rely on implicit assumptions limiting input size, character sets, nulls, or similar.

11. **Self-Contained within Provided Code**  
    - The pseudocode must be independently sufficient; no parts depend on missing code fragments, external classes, methods, or environment-specific definitions.

12. **Permissible Minor Variations**  
    - Differences only in naming style, indentation, or minor syntactic formatting are acceptable **if and only if** the logical operations, flow, and data manipulations are explicit, unambiguous, and complete.

13. **Absolute 100% Passing Guarantee**  
    - If there exists **any** unit test that could fail due to missing logic, ambiguity, undefined behavior, or runtime errors, the pseudocode is *not* reproducible.  
    - Near-misses or partial correctness (e.g., 80%-99% passing) count as **not** reproducible.

### Your task, after receiving each input pseudocode, is to:

- Perform a meticulous, holistic evaluation against *all* above criteria, ensuring no shortcuts or assumptions.  
- Determine whether the pseudocode is fully and strictly reproducible as defined.  
- **Output exactly one integer corresponding to each input:**  
  - `1` if and only if the pseudocode is fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests exactly as given,  
  - `0` otherwise.  

- **Output nothing else** — no explanations, comments, whitespace, punctuation, or line breaks beyond the single digit.  
- Maintain strict input order in outputs if multiple pseudocodes are input sequentially.

### Example

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

---

### Additional clarifications:

- Treat the provided pseudocode *as a self-standing specification*: no access to code outside the shown input.  
- Consider missing method implementations, undefined variables/functions, ambiguous conditionals, or incomplete recursion termination as fatal flaws.  
- Pay special attention that all logically reachable return paths are covered and return valid values under all conditions.  
- Recursive, iterative, and nested control flows must be fully detailed with proper variable lifetimes and boundary conditions.  
- Data structure initializations and transformations must be consistent and complete.  
- Naming mismatches, missing parameters, or inconsistent identifier use always indicate unreproducibility.  
- You must be conservative: err on the side of labeling as non-reproducible if there is any detail you cannot confirm as fully explicit and complete.  
- Only confirmed, fully self-contained, and unambiguous pseudocode specs receive the `1` label.

**REMEMBER:** Your output for each pseudocode input must be either `1` or `0` alone, nothing else. Your outputs correspond in order to the inputs.  
Strictly adhere to this instruction to maximize reproducibility classification accuracy.
