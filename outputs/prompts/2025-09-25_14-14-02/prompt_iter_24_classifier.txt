Given an arbitrary pseudocode input defining one or more classes, functions, variables, control structures, and computations—your task is to rigorously determine whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible with absolute certainty**. "Fully reproducible" is defined as: the pseudocode can be directly and unambiguously implemented exactly as provided, without adding, changing, or fixing anything, such that the resulting program passes **all unit tests completely and correctly**.

---

### Your Output Requirements:

- For each individual pseudocode input snippet, output exactly one character:  
  - `1` if the pseudocode meets **every** reproducibility criterion below.  
  - `0` if it fails **any** criterion or if **any doubt exists** about full reproducibility.  
- No extra text, explanation, whitespace, punctuation, or formatting—only the single digit per input.  
- Outputs must be in the same order as pseudocode inputs received.

### Comprehensive Reproducibility Evaluation Criteria

To decide reproducibility, confirm the pseudocode satisfies **all** the following **without exception**:

1. **Complete, Explicit, and Self-Contained Definition:**
   - All referenced functions, methods, classes, data types, and procedures are fully and concretely defined within the pseudocode.  
   - No implicit reliance on external libraries, frameworks, unstated assumptions, or hidden context.  
   - All input parameters and return values of functions/methods are fully specified, including types or clear semantic roles.  
   - The pseudocode contains all logic to solve the problem as-is, without needing outside code or environment specifics (beyond universally accepted language primitives and basics).

2. **Consistent and Unambiguous Identifier Usage:**
   - Every variable, function, class, parameter, or label is declared explicitly before its first use.  
   - Identifiers are used consistently, without ambiguous shadowing, conflicting redeclarations, or typos.  
   - Variable and function scopes (local, global, class-level) are clearly delineated and inferable from the code structure.  
   - Naming conventions in themselves do not affect reproducibility as long as clarity is unimpaired.

3. **Precise, Complete Syntax and Clear Semantic Structure:**
   - The pseudocode’s syntax is well-formed and sufficient to be translated into valid executable code unambiguously.  
   - All control flow constructs—loops, conditionals, recursion, branching—must have well-defined and explicitly stated:  
     - Loop bounds, iteration ranges, or termination conditions.  
     - Conditional logic with comprehensive coverage (no incomplete or partial branches).  
     - Recursion with clearly defined and reachable base cases preventing infinite loops.  
   - All data manipulations (assignments, indexing, updates) are clearly documented with no unexplained operations.

4. **Explicit Variable Initialization and Data Type Clarity:**
   - Every variable used is explicitly initialized to a valid state/value **before use**; no use of uninitialized data.  
   - Data types must be explicitly stated or so clearly implied as to be unequivocal (e.g., integers, strings, lists with element types).  
   - Data structures' dimensions, contents, and modifications must be defined clearly enough to implement directly.

5. **Exhaustive and Explicit Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The pseudocode explicitly handles all meaningful edge cases and exceptional inputs that the standard comprehensive unit tests would cover, such as:  
     - Empty or null inputs, maximum/minimum bounds, invalid or special data values.  
     - Branches to handle error conditions, boundary conditions, or atypical inputs.  
   - No implicit assumptions or shortcuts that would cause any unit test input to fail or behave unpredictably.

6. **Logical Completeness, No Contradictions or Gaps:**
   - The pseudocode must contain no logical gaps, contradictory instructions, or omissions that break continuity or correctness of the algorithm.  
   - All intermediate calculations and states are well-specified—no missing steps that would hinder direct implementation.  
   - Control flow must not have unreachable code or infinite loops without exit conditions.

7. **No Risk of Runtime or Structural Errors:**
   - The pseudocode is free from potential runtime errors or undefined behavior:  
     - No use of undeclared variables or functions.  
     - All return statements in non-void functions are properly present and consistent.  
     - No illegal or nonsensical data structure operations (e.g., out-of-bounds access without guards).  
     - Control structures are properly closed and syntactically balanced (no dangling loops or conditionals).  
   - Signatures and calls must match exactly in parameters and usage.

8. **Proven Robustness To Pass All Unit Tests Exactly:**
   - The code logic as given must guarantee correct results for **every** conceivable valid test input defined by typical problem specifications and unit tests.  
   - Partial correctness or subset success (e.g., passing only some unit tests) is insufficient—**only full correctness counts**.  
   - The pseudocode must demonstrate robustness, correctness, and termination for all valid inputs.

9. **Exact Implementation Readiness Without Modification:**
   - The pseudocode is directly implementable as given—no amendments, supplements, or error corrections are necessary.  
   - Any ambiguity, uncertainty, or need for inference beyond the provided text must cause a fail (`0`).  
   - Style, formatting, or minor syntactic idiosyncrasies are allowed if logic and clarity are preserved.

### Systematic Evaluation Procedure:

- Fully read and analyze the entire pseudocode, including nested definitions and all structural components.  
- Verify **all** function and class definitions are present and complete with clear parameters and returns.  
- Check all identifier declarations, type clarity, and initialization before any use.  
- Confirm control flow is exhaustively and unambiguously specified, including recursion bases, loop bounds, and conditional branches.  
- Ensure all logical paths cover edge cases and unusual inputs explicitly.  
- Detect and reject any missing steps, contradictions, or plausible runtime errors.  
- Confirm the pseudocode is a self-contained, logically complete solution to the problem.  
- Ignore only cosmetic style variations that do not influence behavior or clarity.  
- If any uncertainty or partial coverage is detected, assign `0`.

---

### Additional Notes:

- Do **not** output explanations, reasoning steps, or any text alongside the digit. Output only `1` or `0`.  
- Outputs must correspond exactly in order to the pseudocode inputs fed.  
- This determination is strict and absolute: a single failing unit test, ambiguity, or incompleteness is a **zero** result.

**Example:**  

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

Use the above rigorous criteria and procedure to evaluate **any** given pseudocode input **with zero tolerance** for ambiguity or imperfection, outputting exactly one digit `1` or `0` per input.

**REMEMBER:** Output only the digit; no commentary or formatting.
