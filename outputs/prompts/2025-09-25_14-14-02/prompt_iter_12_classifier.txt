Given an input of arbitrary pseudocode that may include multiple classes, functions, variables, control structures, and data manipulations, your task is to determine whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible as-is**—meaning it can be directly implemented and will pass **all unit tests without any modifications, corrections, or additional code**. For each input pseudocode, output exactly one digit:

- `1` if it satisfies **all** criteria of full reproducibility;
- `0` otherwise.

No additional text, formatting, explanation, or whitespace—only the digit per input, matching input order.

### Rigorous Definition of Full Reproducibility:

To classify pseudocode as reproducible (`1`), it **must** meet **all** the following strictly and unambiguously:

#### 1. **Complete Internal Definitions and Signatures**

- Every function, method, class, procedure, and variable used anywhere in the pseudocode is fully defined within that pseudocode.
- No references to external code, libraries, or assumed built-ins unless explicitly defined or universally standard (e.g., basic arithmetic operators).
- All function/method signatures fully specify parameter names with data types or clear roles, and include return types where applicable.
- All classes and data structures have complete, self-contained descriptions.

#### 2. **Explicit, Unambiguous Syntax and Semantics**

- The pseudocode must be detailed enough to be unambiguously translated into executable code without guesswork.
- All control flow constructs—loops, conditionals, recursion, and branching—must explicitly define their conditions, bounds, and termination.
- Recursive functions must have clearly reachable, well-defined base cases.
- All operations, including indexing and data manipulation, must have clearly defined bounds and effects.

#### 3. **Consistent and Clear Naming and Scoping**

- All identifiers—variables, functions, classes—are declared before use and used consistently in all contexts.
- Variable and function scopes are explicitly inferable from the pseudocode; no assumptions on implicit or global scopes.
- No ambiguous or conflicting identifier usages.
  
#### 4. **Explicit Initialization and Type Information**

- Every variable is initialized or assigned a valid value before its first use.
- Data types are explicit or clearly inferable with no ambiguity.
- Data structures specify types, sizes/dimensions, and initial content when relevant.
  
#### 5. **Complete Coverage of Typical and Edge Cases**

- Pseudocode explicitly handles normal cases and edge conditions expected by typical unit tests, such as empty inputs, minimum/maximum values, nulls, or boundary conditions.
- No logical branches or cases are left unspecified or implicitly assumed.

#### 6. **No Logical or Structural Gaps or Contradictions**

- All sequences of operations and logic are fully and coherently detailed.
- No missing steps, unresolved conditions, or contradictory instructions.
- All intermediate computations and state updates are fully described.

#### 7. **No Potential Runtime or Structural Failures**

- No undefined or unreachable functions or variables.
- All functions with non-void return types have explicit and consistent return statements on all control paths.
- Operations on data structures are always safe and valid (e.g., bounds-checked indices).
- Loop and conditional constructs are properly opened and closed with no dangling or infinite loops unless termination is explicitly handled.

#### 8. **Self-Contained Implementation Without External Dependencies**

- The entire logic needed for a working, passing implementation must exist within the pseudocode.
- No implicit imports, modules, or runtime systems beyond standard language primitives explicitly stated or universally understood.

#### 9. **Correct Output Specification**

- Return values or output formats are clearly defined in line with expected final program outputs.
  
#### 10. **Minor Stylistic Variations Allowed**

- Minor syntactic, formatting, or naming variations that do not hinder clarity or correctness are acceptable.
- Only logical completeness and specificity dictate reproducibility.

### Evaluation Procedure:

- Fully parse and analyze the entire pseudocode as a coherent whole, including all nested definitions.
- Confirm every called procedure or function is defined internally with complete signatures.
- Validate variables are declared and initialized before usage.
- Confirm control flow statements (loops/recursions/conditionals) have precise, achievable termination.
- Inspect all branches and cases for explicit edge case handling.
- Look for consistency of identifier usage and absence of conflicting or ambiguous naming.
- Detect no structural or logical flaws that could cause unit test failures or runtime exceptions.
- Be zero-tolerant to any imperfection that could cause at least one unit test to fail.
- Allow only definitive reproducibility to output `1`; all else must output `0`.

---

### Output Format:

For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit:

- `1` if the pseudocode meets **every** requirement for full reproducibility.
- `0` otherwise.

No spaces, line breaks, or extra characters. Outputs must correspond **one-to-one** in input order.

---

### IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Reproducibility means **100% passing of all unit tests** with the provided pseudocode as-is.
- Even a single missing detail, ambiguous case, or logical gap results in `0`.
- Do not assume capabilities or code outside what the pseudocode explicitly provides.
- This is a strict, rigorous classification task.

---

### Illustrative Example:

Input pseudocode:
```
CLASS Solution
    FUNCTION sumToN(n integer) RETURNS integer
        SET total TO 0
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n
            ADD i TO total
        END FOR
        RETURN total
    END FUNCTION
END CLASS
```

Output:
```
1
```

**Remember, your output after each pseudocode input must be solely `1` or `0`. Nothing else.**
