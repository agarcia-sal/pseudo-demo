Given any input pseudocode which may include classes, functions, variables, control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion), and data manipulation steps, determine **with complete and unequivocal certainty** whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**. Here, *fully reproducible* means that the pseudocode can be directly converted into a working implementation that passes **all unit tests without any modification, supplementation, or correction**.

---

### Instructions for Evaluation:

You must output exactly one digit per input pseudocode:
- Output `1` if and only if the pseudocode satisfies **all** criteria below and can be guaranteed to pass **every** unit test exactly as given.
- Output `0` if any criterion is not met, or if there remains **any reasonable doubt** about reproducibility or correctness.

No explanations, no whitespace, no extra characters—only a single digit `1` or `0` per input pseudocode, in exact input order.

---

### Comprehensive Criteria for Full Reproducibility:

1. **Complete, Explicit, and Self-Contained Definitions:**
   - All functions, methods, classes, and procedures used anywhere are fully and explicitly defined in the pseudocode.
   - No references to undefined functions, libraries, or external modules beyond common, well-known primitives explicitly permitted.
   - Function/method signatures must state all parameters (with types or clearly defined roles) _and_ return types if applicable.
   - All nested functions or helpers must be defined within accessible scope.

2. **Syntactic and Semantic Clarity and Precision:**
   - The pseudocode syntax is sufficiently explicit and precise to be mechanically translated into executable code without ambiguity.
   - Loops and conditionals clearly indicate exact iteration bounds, termination conditions, and case coverage.
   - Recursive functions explicitly include clearly defined and reachable base cases ensuring termination.
   - All control flows (including breaks, continues, exceptions if any) are fully spelled out without ambiguity or multiple possible interpretations.

3. **Consistent and Unambiguous Naming and Scope Resolution:**
   - Every variable, function, class, or object is declared before use.
   - Names are consistent and not ambiguous or conflicting.
   - Variable scopes (global, local, closures) are directly inferable from the pseudocode without assumptions.
   - No identifiers are introduced implicitly or without definitions.

4. **Explicit Initialization and Type Clarity:**
   - Every variable is initialized or assigned a valid value before any usage.
   - Data types or roles of variables, function arguments, arrays, and data structures are explicitly stated or can be unambiguously deduced.
   - Data structures specify their type, dimensions, content if initialized, and all modifications clearly.

5. **Complete and Explicit Edge Case and Exception Handling:**
   - The pseudocode explicitly accounts for all typical and edge input cases known to be covered by unit tests (including empty inputs, maximal/minimal values, unusual values, boundary conditions).
   - No branches, cases, or inputs are omitted or left implicit.
   - Fail-safe guards against invalid accesses, divisions by zero, null dereferences, or other runtime errors are present where required.

6. **Logical Consistency and Exhaustiveness:**
   - The pseudocode is free from contradictions, logical gaps, or unintentionally missing steps.
   - Intermediate computational steps are fully specified when essential for correctness.
   - No shortcuts, partial implementations, or reliance on external explanations.

7. **Robustness Against Runtime Errors and Structural Faults:**
   - No usage of undefined or uninitialized variables, functions, or data structures.
   - Return statements correctly appear in all function exit paths where a return is expected.
   - No illegal operations such as out-of-bound indexing without conditional protection.
   - All loop constructs and conditional branches are properly opened and closed, with no malformed flows.
   - All function and method calls match their declared signatures consistently.

8. **Guaranteed Passing of 100% Unit Tests:**
   - The pseudocode represents a fully correct algorithm according to the problem’s specification.
   - It must be robust against all inputs and edge cases that typical unit tests would exercise.
   - Partial or near misses (e.g. passing 80% or 99%) are not sufficient — all tests must pass.

9. **Self-Contained Implementation Without External Dependency:**
   - No required logic, data, or calls missing from the pseudocode that would need to be "filled in" externally.
   - Only well-known, standard language primitives and constructs are allowed as implicit assumptions.
   - No calls to non-standard or unspecified external systems, libraries, or environment-specific features.

10. **Permissible Variations:**
    - Formatting style, indentation, variable naming conventions, and minor syntactic differences are acceptable as long as they do not introduce ambiguity or incompleteness.
    - Logical equivalence overrides superficial differences.

### Stepwise Evaluation Procedure:

- Parse the entire pseudocode accurately, including all nested scopes.
- Confirm presence and precise definitions of all required components.
- Verify that all used variables, functions, and classes are declared, initialized, and consistent.
- Validate all control structures are fully specified with clear boundaries and termination.
- Confirm explicit coverage of expected edge cases and error guards.
- Detect any contradictions, missing logic, or implicit assumptions that would preclude successful execution.
- Assume no unknown implicit behaviors; any unavoidable doubt leads to a `0`.
- Accept stylistic freedoms that do not obscure or omit required logic.
- Remember: perfect reproducibility is mandatory for a `1`.

### Output Format:

For each pseudocode input processed, output a single digit, either:

- `1` (fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests as-is), or
- `0` (otherwise, including any ambiguity or partial correctness).

No additional text, no line breaks, no commentary—only the digit per input, in order.

**Example:**

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n) RETURNS integer  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

---

**Strictness reminder:**  
If any missing component, ambiguous part, potential runtime error, or partial correctness is found, output `0`. Only flawless, fully explicit, and logically sound pseudocode compliant with all above criteria merits `1`.
