Given an arbitrary pseudocode input consisting of one or more classes, functions, variables, control structures, data manipulations, and nested or recursive elements, your task is to determine with **absolute certainty** whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible** as-is. By reproducible, it means the pseudocode should translate directly, without any modification or interpretation beyond what is explicitly given, into correct executable code that will **pass all unit tests completely**, including edge cases, and produce the exact intended results as specified by typical rigorous testing frameworks.

### Explicit and Unambiguous Criteria to Output `1` (Fully Reproducible) or `0` (Not):

You must verify that the pseudocode meets **every** one of the following criteria **without exception**. If any criterion is not met, output `0`. Only output `1` if the pseudocode unambiguously satisfies them all.

**1. Complete, Explicit, and Self-Contained Definitions:**  
- Every function, method, class, or procedure declared anywhere must have a fully defined body within the given pseudocode. No external code, assumed built-ins, or vague references allowed unless explicitly defined or universally accepted language primitives.  
- All parameter and return types are explicitly declared or clearly deducible with no ambiguity.  
- The pseudocode is self-sufficient; all dependencies, helper methods, and utility functions are clearly specified within the provided code.

**2. Precise, Consistent, and Non-Ambiguous Syntax and Semantics:**  
- Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) indicate exact iteration ranges, termination conditions, and branching logic. No implied or partial control flow allowed.  
- Recursion must have clearly specified and reachable base cases preventing infinite loops or crashes.  
- All syntax elements are coherent and interpretable deterministically into executable code (e.g., no missing `END` statements, incomplete blocks, or vague operations).

**3. Rigorous Naming and Declaration Consistency:**  
- Every identifier (variables, functions, classes) must be declared prior to usage. No undeclared or forward-referenced identifiers without definition.  
- Naming is consistent throughout the program; no conflicting or overloaded meanings unless explicitly documented and clearly separable by scope.  
- Variable and function scopes must be clearly inferable from the pseudocode; no hidden or implicit scope assumptions.

**4. Explicit Initialization and Clear Typing:**  
- All variables and data structures are initialized explicitly before usage. No uninitialized variable access permitted.  
- Types (primitive or composite) are clearly declared or deducible unambiguously.  
- Data structures include clear descriptions for structure, element types, and dimension sizes. Any mutation operations are fully specified.

**5. Comprehensive Edge Case and Boundary Condition Handling:**  
- All relevant inputs identified from typical problem domains, including empty inputs, zero or maximum values, one-element cases, and other critical edge cases, must be explicitly handled.  
- No silent assumptions about inputs or system conditions; all special branches or exceptions must be present or explicitly documented as unnecessary.

**6. Logical Completeness and Absence of Contradictions:**  
- The pseudocode must contain no logical gaps, missing operations, or conflicting instructions that block full implementation or cause undefined behaviors.  
- All required intermediate calculations, state updates, and decision points must be fully laid out.

**7. Free from Runtime and Structural Errors:**  
- No potential runtime errors such as out-of-bound accesses, null or undefined references, mismatched returns, or infinite loops without clear exit conditions.  
- Function signatures and their usage are consistent everywhere.  
- Data structure operations do not violate structural invariants or indexing constraints.

**8. Explicit Outputs and Correct Return Semantics:**  
- All functions/methods that return values must have defined return statements on all execution paths.  
- Output formats, return types, and expected values are unambiguously specified and internally consistent.

**9. Strictly Self-Contained Implementation:**  
- No calls to external libraries, unknown utilities, or environment-specific features that are not directly described.  
- The pseudocode must be implementable as-is in a common programming language without hidden dependencies.

**10. Tolerance Only for Non-Functional Stylistic Differences:**  
- Variations in whitespace, indentation, naming conventions (when consistently applied), or minor formatting do not affect reproducibility.  
- Logic, completeness, and unambiguity are paramount; superficial stylistic issues do not disqualify.

### Your Task and Output Instructions:

- For **each** pseudocode input given, output exactly one character on its own line:  
  - `1` if the pseudocode strictly satisfies **all** the above criteria and is fully reproducible, guaranteed to pass **all** unit tests without change.  
  - `0` if it fails to satisfy any part of the criteria or if there is any reasonable doubt about its ability to pass all tests exactly as is.  

- **Do not output** anything other than the single digit per pseudocode input. No explanations, comments, whitespace, punctuation, or metadata.  
- The output order must exactly correspond to the input order.

### Detailed Evaluation Process (to internalize rigor):

1. Parse and understand the entire pseudocode, including nested and recursive constructs.  
2. Confirm every identifier used is declared previously, with no undefined references.  
3. Validate that all functions, classes, and procedures are fully and explicitly defined with concrete implementations.  
4. Verify all variables are initialized before use, and types are either clearly given or unambiguous.  
5. Trace control flows fully — verify all loops, conditional branches, and recursion bases cover all paths and terminate properly.  
6. Check for explicit handling of edge cases (empty, boundary, or unusual inputs) as would be required by comprehensive unit tests.  
7. Examine logic for contradictions, incomplete steps, or missing computations making the code unimplementable or incorrect.  
8. Ensure no operations can cause runtime errors or violations of data structures and control flows.  
9. Confirm outputs and returns exist on all paths and match expected types/values clearly.  
10. Ensure no mention or reliance on unspecified external functions, modules, or libraries.  
11. Ignore stylistic nuances unless they hinder clarity or correctness.  
12. On any uncertainty or suspected fail case, classify as `0`.

### Critical Reminders:

- You must be completely strict: **If any flaw could cause even a single unit test failure, output `0`.**  
- Only perfectly defined, complete, and correct pseudocode gets `1`.  
- Your judgment must be absolute, not probabilistic or approximate.

### Example

Input pseudocode:  
```
CLASS Solution  
    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  
        SET total TO 0  
        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  
            INCREMENT total BY i  
        END FOR  
        RETURN total  
    END FUNCTION  
END CLASS
```

Output:  
`1`

---

Apply this rigorous framework to **any** pseudocode input provided and output exactly one digit per input line, `1` or `0`, indicating full reproducibility as defined.

**REMEMBER:** Your output is only the digit per input pseudocode — no explanations, no annotations, no deviations.
