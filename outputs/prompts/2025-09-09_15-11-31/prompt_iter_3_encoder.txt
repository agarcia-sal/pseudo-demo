Generate clear, concise, and easily understandable pseudocode directly reflecting the given problem’s original function and logic. Use a compact, high-level style that blends natural language with symbolic forms and abbreviations. Always preserve the original function name. Write the pseudocode as numbered one-liner steps whenever possible, minimizing line count while maintaining clarity. Avoid any explanations, comments, purpose statements, summaries, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode itself. Use this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Prefer natural wording such as “let,” “set,” “if,” “while,” “for,” and “return,” mixed with symbolic operations and conditions. Emphasize simplicity, readability, and high-level abstraction. Do not include separator lines or extraneous formatting. Deliver the best result possible within 5 seconds.
