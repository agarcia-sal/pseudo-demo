Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use natural language combined with symbolic notations and abbreviations. Maintain the original function name. Prefer compact, one-line statements numbered sequentially as shown:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, notes, or any text besides the pseudocode itself. Use clear control flow and minimal syntax. Avoid separator lines or headers. Aim for clarity and brevity, expressing algorithms at a high level without excessive detail. Output only the numbered pseudocode steps within the 5-second time limit.
