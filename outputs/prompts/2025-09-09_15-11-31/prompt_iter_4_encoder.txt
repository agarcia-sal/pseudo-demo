Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read high-level pseudocode from the given problem description, preserving the original function name. Use mostly natural language with symbolic notation and abbreviations where helpful. Write numbered steps with one-liners whenever possible. Avoid providing summaries, explanations, comments, notes, or purpose statements. Use compact expressions and standard control flow keywords. Follow this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce only the pseudocode—no extra text or formatting. Ensure the pseudocode is standalone, unambiguous, and captures the core logic at an appropriate abstraction level. Your function runs within a 5-second timeout; deliver the best result within this limit.
