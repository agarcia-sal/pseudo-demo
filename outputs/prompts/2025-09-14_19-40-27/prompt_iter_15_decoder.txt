Translate the provided pseudocode into complete, clean, and highly efficient Python 3 code. Strictly adhere to these instructions:

- Preserve all original class names, function names, parameters, and the exact class/object structure from the pseudocode.
- Implement the logic exactly as givenâ€”do not add, remove, or modify the algorithm or specified behavior.
- Handle all implicit and explicit edge cases and constraints logically derivable from the pseudocode.
- Optimize for idiomatic, readable, and performant Python code that reliably executes within 5 seconds.
- You may import and use any standard or third-party Python libraries if they improve correctness or performance, but avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Include any helper functions or data structures required or logically implied for full correctness.
- Match output formats (return values, prints) precisely as indicated in the pseudocode.
- Provide minimal, focused comments only to clarify complex or non-obvious code parts. Avoid verbose explanations or extra text.
- Output exclusively a single Python code block with your entire solution like below, without any additional text or delimiters:

```python
