Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully working, clean, and well-structured Python 3 solution adhering strictly to the following guidelines:

- Preserve all class names, method names, parameters, and the structure of classes and objects exactly as given in the pseudocode without any renaming or structural changes.
- Implement the algorithm logic exactly as expressed by the pseudocode. Do not add, remove, or alter steps, but carefully infer implicit details and edge cases inherently suggested by the pseudocode.
- Use clear, idiomatic, and efficient Python 3 code to ensure correctness and that the solution runs within 5 seconds for all reasonable inputs.
- You may import and use any Python standard library modules or widely adopted third-party packages **only if** they improve code clarity, correctness, or performance and their usage aligns naturally with the pseudocode’s intent.
- Create any necessary helper functions, classes, or data structures that the pseudocode implies for completeness and correctness.
- Match all output formats exactly as prescribed by the pseudocode — return statements, print outputs, or other specified interfaces must be identical in behavior.
- Add only concise, purposeful comments explaining subtle, non-obvious, or complex parts of the code. Avoid verbosity or unrelated commentary.
- Output exactly one Python code snippet enclosed in a single triple-backtick code block with `python` specified — no extra text, explanations, or extraneous output before or after.
