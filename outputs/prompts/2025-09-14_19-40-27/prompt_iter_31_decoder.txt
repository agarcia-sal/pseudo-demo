Translate the given pseudocode into an accurate, fully functional Python 3 implementation with these enhanced instructions:

- Retain **all** class names, method names, function names, parameters, and the overall structure exactly as specified in the pseudocode. Do **not** rename or restructure classes or methods.
- Strictly implement the logic and flow exactly as described in the pseudocode. Do **not** add or omit any steps or alter the algorithm’s intended behavior. However, infer and handle any implicit edge cases or data types logically implied.
- Ensure compatibility with typical coding challenge input/output conventions (e.g., return values vs print statements) exactly as indicated in the pseudocode.
- Use idiomatic, clear, efficient Python 3 code that will reliably execute within 5 seconds on reasonable inputs.
- You may import and use any Python standard library or widely used third-party packages that naturally improve clarity, correctness, or performance, but only when fully justified by the pseudocode’s intent.
- Implement any helper functions, inner classes, or data structures that are logically implied or necessary for a coherent, complete translation.
- Carefully handle typical input formats, including converting from common data structures (e.g., lists to linked lists for node-based problems) **only if** the pseudocode indicates such structures.
- Use explicit type annotations as per the pseudocode’s style, if present.
- Include only brief, meaningful comments that clarify subtle or non-trivial parts of the code. Avoid verbosity or redundant comments.
- Output a single cohesive Python code snippet **only**, enclosed within a single triple backtick code block with `python` specified. Do not output anything else before or after the code block, including explanations or commentary.
- Prioritize correctness, clarity, faithful adherence to pseudocode, and robust handling of edge cases to maximize passing test results.
