Translate the following pseudocode into correct, efficient, and executable Python code. Your translation must:

- Preserve all original class names, function names, parameters, and the overall structure exactly as given in the pseudocode.
- Implement all logic faithfully and clearly, ensuring no functionality or detail is lost or altered.
- Use only standard Python packages unless explicitly required otherwise.
- Be optimized for clarity and performance, suitable to run within a 5-second runtime.
- Include necessary helper classes or data structures if implied by the pseudocode.
- Handle edge cases implicitly suggested by the pseudocode.
- Return or print results if the pseudocode specifies a return or output.

Output only the complete Python code enclosed inside a single Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Do not include any explanations, comments beyond those necessary for code clarity, or additional text outside the code block.
