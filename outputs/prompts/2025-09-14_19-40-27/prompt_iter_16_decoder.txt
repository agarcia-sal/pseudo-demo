Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, clean, and efficient Python 3 implementation as follows:

- Retain all original class names, method names, parameters, and the exact class and object structure from the pseudocode without modifications.
- Implement the logic strictly as presented in the pseudocode; do not alter the algorithm, add extra functionality, or remove any specified behavior.
- Carefully infer and handle any implicit edge cases or constraints logically derivable from the pseudocode.
- Write idiomatic, readable, and optimized Python code that reliably completes execution within 5 seconds.
- You may import and utilize any Python standard library or widely used third-party packages if they clearly enhance correctness, clarity, or performance, but avoid importing unnecessary or uncommon dependencies.
- Define any helper functions, classes, or data structures as required or naturally implied by the pseudocode to ensure a complete and correct solution.
- Precisely match the output format (return values, print statements, etc.) exactly as the pseudocode indicates.
- Include only concise comments to clarify non-trivial or subtle parts of the codeâ€”avoid verbose explanations, digressions, or unrelated textual output.
- Output solely a single Python code block containing your entire solution exactly as below, with no additional text before or after:
