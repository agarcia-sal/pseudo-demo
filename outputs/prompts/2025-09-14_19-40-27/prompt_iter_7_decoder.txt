Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, correct, and highly efficient Python code within the same class and function structure as presented. Your translation must:

- Keep all class names, function names, parameter names, and code hierarchy identical to the pseudocode.
- Translate all logic precisely, with no loss or modification of the intended behavior.
- Use Python best practices for clarity, idiomatic style, and performance.
- Handle all implicitly suggested edge cases and input constraints from the pseudocode.
- Include any necessary helper functions, classes, or data structures that are implied or required by the pseudocode.
- Return or print output exactly if the pseudocode specifies it.
- Optimize the code to run within 5 seconds for typical problem constraints.
- Use any standard or third-party Python libraries if doing so improves correctness, clarity, or performance.
- Provide a single, self-contained Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# Your translated and optimized code here
```

Do not include any additional explanation, comments beyond those needed for code clarity, or text outside the code block.
