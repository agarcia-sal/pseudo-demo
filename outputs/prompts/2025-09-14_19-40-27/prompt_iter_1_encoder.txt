Generate pseudocode for the given problem description. The pseudocode must be concise, easy to read, and understandable, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Prefer one-liners and a compact, high-level style. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Format steps as numbered lines, for example:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Aim to produce the best possible pseudocode within a 5-second timeout.
