Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, correct, and efficient Python code while preserving all original function names, class names, and class/object structures exactly as described in the pseudocode. Ensure that your final solution:

- Encloses the entire Python code within a single markdown Python code block: ```python ... ```
- Defines all classes and methods exactly as indicated in the pseudocode (including constructors if any), and returns or prints results as appropriate.
- Uses standard and efficient Python idioms and libraries where suitable.
- Prioritizes readability, correctness, and performance within a 5-second execution timeout.
- Includes necessary imports but no extraneous code or test code outside the class/method definitions.
- Avoids references to any undefined classes or wrappers (e.g., do NOT assume a class named "Solution" unless specified in the pseudocode).
- Does not add debugging or placeholder lines unrelated to the pseudocode logic.
- Handles edge cases implicitly suggested or common for the described algorithm.
