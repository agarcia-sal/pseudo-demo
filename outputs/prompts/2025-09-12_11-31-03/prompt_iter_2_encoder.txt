Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the given problem description. The pseudocode must:

- Use the exact original class names and function names in their original class/object structure.
- Be high-level and compact, preferably one-liners, with symbolic notation and common abbreviations.
- Use natural language phrasing for clarity but remain succinct.
- Avoid any purpose, summary, explanation, comments, or overview statements.
- Follow this numbered step-by-step format strictly, with no separator lines or extra text:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Output only the pseudocode. Ensure clarity and brevity while preserving the algorithm’s logic, aiming to generate a correct, executable-level outline within a 5-second limit.
