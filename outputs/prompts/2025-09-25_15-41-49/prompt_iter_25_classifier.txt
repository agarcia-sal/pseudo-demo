You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each purporting to fully specify a standalone solution to some computational problem.

For each snippet, output a single digit on its own line, with no extra text or formatting:  
- Output `1` if the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, meaning it contains *all* information required to implement it exactly as is, and this implementation would pass *all* relevant unit tests without failure.  
- Output `0` if it is missing any necessary detail, contains logic errors, ambiguities, incomplete specifications, or would fail any unit tests.

---

**To decide reproducibility, rigorously apply these three pillars:**

1. **Complete Explicitness and Self-Containment**  
   - All variables, inputs, outputs, data structures, and auxiliary functions are fully declared or unambiguously defined within the snippet.  
   - Every computational step, including initializations, loops, conditions, assignments, and returns, is explicitly described—no implicit or assumed operations.  
   - No external context, hidden assumptions, or prior knowledge is required. If referenced, all subroutines or helper functions are fully defined or clearly specified in the snippet.  
   - Edge cases and special conditions must be explicitly addressed or clearly implied.

2. **Logical and Semantic Correctness**  
   - The pseudocode’s algorithmic logic is consistent, sound, and handles *every* valid input case correctly.  
   - Control flow (loops, recursion, conditionals) is guaranteed to terminate appropriately and produce expected outputs.  
   - There are no contradictions, infinite loops, unreachable code, or logical gaps.  
   - Mentally simulate typical, edge, and boundary cases to verify correctness.

3. **Unambiguous and Deterministic Specification**  
   - Each line or instruction maps clearly to exactly one precise implementation choice—no ambiguity in variable scopes, operations, or data representations.  
   - Output format, type, and behavior are explicitly and fully specified, with no conditional or partial outputs that could lead to uncertainty.  
   - Control structures must be syntactically and semantically coherent according to the pseudocode style used.

**Strict Instructions:**  
- Do *not* infer or fill in any unstated details beyond the presented pseudocode.  
- If *any* doubt, ambiguity, incompleteness, or error exists, output `0`.  
- Output `1` *only* if every criterion above is *unequivocally* met.  
- Produce exactly one digit per snippet, in input order, one per line, with no additional text or formatting.
