```
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each purporting to fully specify a complete standalone solution to a computational problem.

Your task: For each snippet, decide if it is **REPRODUCIBLE**, meaning that if implemented exactly as written—without any external assumptions, guesswork, or omitted details—it will pass **all** relevant unit tests for correctness, edge cases, and robustness, reliably and deterministically.

For each snippet, output a single digit on its own line in the input order:  
- `1` if it is fully reproducible  
- `0` if it is not  

Output strictly these digits only, no extra text, explanation, formatting, or whitespace.

---

To determine **REPRODUCIBILITY**, rigorously verify all of the following for each snippet:

1. **Complete and Self-Contained Specification**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, and initial states are fully and explicitly defined or inherently unambiguous.  
   - The pseudocode includes all necessary components—initializations, loops, conditionals, recursion, helper procedures—within the snippet or clearly defined therein.  
   - No reliance on implicit knowledge, unspecified functions, or undefined behaviors.  
   - Edge cases and special scenarios (e.g., empty inputs, boundary conditions) are explicitly addressed or logically covered without gaps.

2. **Unambiguous, Precise Semantics**  
   - Every statement and control flow element is clearly specified, ruling out multiple plausible interpretations.  
   - Variable scopes, data types, loop bounds, indexing, and arithmetic operations are definitively stated.  
   - No vague terms, incomplete statements, or contradictions that require guessing or inference.

3. **Logical Correctness and Soundness**  
   - The algorithm correctly solves the problem for all valid inputs—including boundary and corner cases—based solely on the given pseudocode.  
   - No logical flaws, infinite loops without termination, or unreachable code segments.  
   - The flow guarantees progress and termination with a well-defined final output.

4. **Deterministic and Complete Output Definition**  
   - The output(s) have clearly specified formats and semantics.  
   - Return or output statements are unambiguous and ensure a single, deterministic final outcome.  
   - No conditional or partial returns that lead to uncertain or incomplete result states.

5. **Consistency in Style and Structure**  
   - Control structures (loops, recursion, conditionals) and data manipulations are syntactically and semantically coherent.  
   - Variables and data are properly defined before use, and modified consistently across the snippet.  
   - Naming and referencing are consistent to prevent confusion.

---

**Key Evaluation Principles:**  
- Do **not** expand, infer, or supply details beyond what the snippet explicitly provides.  
- Do **not** tolerate any ambiguity, missing elements, or potential misinterpretations.  
- When in doubt—even if the snippet looks nearly complete—output `0`.  
- Only output `1` when the snippet **unquestionably** fulfills **all** criteria above.
