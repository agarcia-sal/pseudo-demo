You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully solve a computational problem.

Your task:  
For each snippet, determine **REPRODUCIBILITY**, defined as:  
- If the pseudocode were implemented exactly as written (no assumptions, external knowledge, or missing information filled in), it will reliably pass **all** relevant unit tests for the problem.  

Output:  
- For each pseudocode snippet, output a single digit on its own line:  
  - `1` if the snippet is unquestionably reproducible as defined.  
  - `0` otherwise.  
- Output no other text, explanation, or formatting. The order of output lines must match the order of input snippets.

---

To rigorously assess reproducibility, perform these layered checks:

1. **Complete Explicitness:**  
   - Every input, output, variable, data structure, and helper construct is fully defined or unambiguously described.  
   - All initialization, iterations, conditionals, function calls, and returns are clearly and exhaustively stated.  
   - Edge cases, boundary conditions, and special situations are explicitly handled or logically implied without unstated gaps.  
   - No implicit assumptions or external code dependencies exist beyond what is given.

2. **Logical Correctness and Soundness:**  
   - The algorithmic logic is coherent and correctly addresses all valid inputs, including edge and corner cases.  
   - No contradictions, infinite loops, dead code sections, or incomplete control flows are present.  
   - Mentally simulate varying representative inputs (including boundary values) to verify if logic produces correct output.

3. **Unambiguous and Precise Language:**  
   - Each operation, assignment, and decision is expressed clearly, allowing only one correct interpretation consistent with common pseudocode conventions.  
   - Avoid ambiguous terms, unclear variable scope, confusing expressions, or vague instructions.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence:**  
   - The snippet includes everything needed to implement the solutionâ€”no external snippets, libraries, or context required.  
   - If it refers to standard or auxiliary functions, their definitions or invocation contexts must be explicitly included with enough detail for correct implementation.

5. **Structural and Semantic Integrity:**  
   - Control structures and data manipulations follow consistent syntax and semantics fitting the pseudocode style.  
   - Variables are always initialized before use; loops and recursions have clear termination conditions.  
   - Final outputs or return values are well-defined, deterministic, and unconditionally resulting from the described logic.

6. **Deterministic and Complete Output Specification:**  
   - Outputs specify precise data types, formats, and conditions for return or print statements.  
   - No ambiguous, partial, or conditional output paths that cause uncertainty about final outputs.

---

**Strict Decision Rule:**  
If and only if **every** above criterion is fully satisfied without doubt or ambiguity, output `1` for that snippet; else output `0`.

Do NOT guess, infer, or assume any missing details.  

Process all snippets in input order and produce only the requested output digits immediately.
