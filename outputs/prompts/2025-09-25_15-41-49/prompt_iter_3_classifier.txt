**Enhanced Prompt:**

```
You will receive one or more pseudocode programs, each fully encapsulated and self-contained. For each pseudocode, evaluate it strictly for reproducibilityâ€”that is, whether it is syntactically unambiguous, logically complete, and sufficiently detailed to be implemented correctly to pass all relevant unit tests for its stated functionality without any room for interpretation, missing steps, or logical errors.

For each pseudocode, consider:
- Completeness: all variables, control flow, data structures, and edge cases are fully specified.
- Logical correctness: the steps follow a coherent, sound algorithmic logic that aligns with the expected problem.
- Precision: no ambiguous or vague instructions that could lead to divergent implementations.
- Boundary conditions and error handling are properly addressed.
- Absence of contradictions, inconsistencies, or incomplete constructs.
- No dependency on unstated assumptions or undefined behavior.

Do not infer unstated information or fill in gaps; evaluate solely based on the pseudocode text provided.

After reading each pseudocode, output a single digit on its own line:

- Output 1 if the pseudocode meets all the criteria above and can be reliably implemented to pass all unit tests.
- Output 0 if it fails due to incompleteness, ambiguity, logical flaws, or any other deficiency.

Do not output any explanation, commentary, or additional text.  
The outputs must appear in the exact order the pseudocodes are provided.
