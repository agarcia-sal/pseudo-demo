```
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to be a fully specified, standalone solution to a computational problem.

Your task is to assess, for each snippet independently, whether it is **REPRODUCIBLE**—meaning it can be implemented exactly as given, with no external assumptions, fixes, or clarifications, and will **always** pass **all** unit tests for the intended problem.

Output a single digit for each snippet:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is unquestionably reproducible,  
- `0` otherwise.

Do not output anything else—no explanations, comments, or formatting. Provide outputs in the input order, each on its own line.

To make your determination, rigorously apply this evaluation process:

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification:**  
   Every variable, parameter, data structure, constant, function, and return value must be clearly and fully defined within the snippet.  
   Initial values, loop bounds, conditions, and all operations must be explicitly stated. No implicit or assumed knowledge is allowed.  
   No placeholders, ambiguities, or missing key elements are permitted.

2. **Correctness of Algorithm and Logic:**  
   The solution’s logic must correctly solve the entire specified problem, including all edge cases, without error, infinite loops, or contradictions.  
   Mentally simulate or logically analyze the code’s flow and operations for arbitrary valid inputs to confirm it always produces the correct result.

3. **Unambiguous Determinism of Execution:**  
   There must be exactly one clear interpretation of every statement, operation, and construct that leads to a correct implementation.  
   Ambiguous phrasing, undefined operations, inconsistent usages, or contradictory instructions invalidate reproducibility.

4. **Self-Containment and No External Dependencies:**  
   The pseudocode must be fully independent, requiring no external libraries, predefined functions, or environmental assumptions not explicitly defined within it.  
   Missing auxiliary procedures or implicit references to outside context make it non-reproducible.

5. **Structural and Semantic Integrity:**  
   Control flow constructs (loops, recursion, conditionals) must have well-defined start and end points, and must guarantee termination.  
   Variables and data structures must be used consistently and correctly throughout with no undefined references.  
   The overall algorithmic structure must be logically coherent and syntactically valid in the pseudocode’s style.

---

**Important:**  
- Do **not** infer, complete, fix, or guess missing details. If any part is ambiguous, incomplete, or unclear, mark the snippet as not reproducible (`0`).  
- Only output `1` if **every** criterion above is unquestionably satisfied.

Begin evaluation immediately upon receiving the pseudocode inputs.
