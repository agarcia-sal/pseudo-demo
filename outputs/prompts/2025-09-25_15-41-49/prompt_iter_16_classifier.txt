```
You will be provided one or more pseudocode snippets. Each snippet claims to fully specify a solution for a particular computational problem.

Your task is to independently evaluate each snippet and determine whether it is strictly **REPRODUCIBLE** â€” meaning that if implemented verbatim, *without adding, changing, or guessing any detail*, the resulting program will **pass all relevant unit tests for that problem without fail**.

**Key Criteria for REPRODUCIBILITY:**  
1. **Complete and Explicit Specification:**  
   - Every element necessary for an implementation is present and clearly defined: variables, data structures, initializations, loop/conditional boundaries, return values, and handling of all edge cases.  
   - No essential information is omitted, vague, or only implied. Do NOT infer or supply missing details.  

2. **Correctness Over All Inputs:**  
   - The algorithm as stated must be logically sound, guaranteeing correct outputs on *every* valid input, including boundary and corner cases.  
   - There must be no logical errors, infinite loops, contradictions, or failure modes detectable from the pseudocode itself.  

3. **Unambiguity and Determinism:**  
   - Instructions must be unambiguous and fully deterministic, allowing exactly one consistent interpretation leading to a correct, complete implementation.  
   - Ambiguous phrasing, undefined operations, or unclear control flow invalidate reproducibility.  

4. **Self-Contained Without External Dependencies:**  
   - The snippet must be fully standalone, not relying on external code, assumptions, or environment beyond what it explicitly states.  
   - Missing crucial auxiliary functions or initializations, or dependence on unspecified libraries or conventions counts as not reproducible.  

5. **Syntactic and Semantic Coherence:**  
   - Control structures, data manipulations, and output statements must be structurally valid within the pseudocode conventions and semantically meaningful.  
   - Execution flow must start and terminate properly, without unresolved constructs or undefined variables.  

**Evaluation Instructions:**  
- Analyze each snippet carefully, considering all the above criteria.  
- If *every* criterion for REPRODUCIBILITY is unequivocally met, output `1` for that snippet. Otherwise, output `0`.  
- Do NOT attempt to fix, guess, or complete the pseudocode. If in doubt or if any ambiguity or incompleteness exists, output `0`.  
- Outputs must be in the exact order of the input snippets, one digit per line, with no additional text or formatting.

Begin your evaluation immediately upon receiving the pseudocode inputs.
