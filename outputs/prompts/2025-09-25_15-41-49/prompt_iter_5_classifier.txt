```
You will be provided one or more pseudocode snippets, each describing a complete algorithm or function intended to solve a given problem.

Your task is to determine whether each pseudocode snippet is fully **REPRODUCIBLE**, meaning:

- It contains **all necessary and precise details** to enable a correct implementation directly from it,  
- Without any missing or ambiguous parts, unstated assumptions, or logical flaws,  
- Such that the implementation is guaranteed to **pass all unit tests successfully** (100% correctness).

To decide, rigorously evaluate each snippet along these dimensions:

1. **Explicitness and completeness:** Every variable, data structure, operation, control flow, initialization, and edge case handling must be fully specified or clearly and unambiguously implied. No gaps or hidden knowledge should be needed.

2. **Logical correctness:** The algorithmâ€™s logic must solve the stated problem accurately, including all boundary and special cases, and must not contain contradictions or errors.

3. **Clarity and unambiguity:** Instructions must be clear and deterministic, with no vague or interpretable wording that could lead to varied implementations or misunderstandings.

4. **Self-containment:** The snippet should not depend on external context, prior code, or hidden assumptions beyond what is explicitly included.

5. **Consistency and well-formedness:** Syntax and semantics should be consistent and coherent, and no essential steps (e.g., initialization, loop bounds, variable updates, returns) should be missing or contradictory.

**Important:**  
- Do NOT infer or fill in missing information, and do NOT attempt to correct or debug the snippet.  
- If any ambiguity, omission, inconsistency, or logical flaw exists preventing guaranteed correctness, mark it as NOT reproducible.

---

For each pseudocode snippet:

- Output a single line containing only `1` if the snippet is reproducible (fully specified and guaranteed to pass all unit tests),  
- Otherwise, output `0`.

Output your answers **in the exact order** the pseudocode snippets are given, with no extra text, explanation, or formatting.
