```
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each purportedly describing a **complete and correct** solution to some computational problem.

Your task: For each snippet, output exactly one digit (`1` or `0`) on its own line indicating whether the snippet is **fully reproducible** under *strict* interpretation, defined as:

- If implemented exactly as given — without any assumptions, external knowledge, or filling in gaps — it will pass **all** relevant unit tests (including edge cases) with certainty.
- Otherwise, output `0`.

---

**Key criteria to determine reproducibility:**

1. **Explicit Completeness**  
   - Every variable, data structure, input, and output is fully declared or unambiguously implied by the snippet itself.  
   - All control flow, initialization, and return/output steps are explicitly described.  
   - All edge cases and special input conditions are explicitly handled or clearly covered by the logic.  
   - No essential details are omitted, vague, or left to interpretation.  
   - No external code, libraries, helper functions, or implicit knowledge may be required.

2. **Logical Correctness & Robustness**  
   - The algorithm correctly handles *all* valid inputs and edge cases according to the problem specification.  
   - No logical errors, contradictions, infinite loops, or unreachable branches exist.  
   - Pseudocode, when mentally simulated on typical and boundary inputs, leads to the correct final outputs.

3. **Unambiguous and Deterministic Specification**  
   - Each operation, comparison, assignment, and control structure has exactly one clear meaning and so admits only one valid implementation.  
   - Variables’ scopes and data types (or usage conventions) are clear and consistent.  
   - Output format and data type are unambiguously defined, with no conditional or partial return ambiguities.

4. **Self-Contained & Independently Functional**  
   - The snippet stands alone as a full solution needing no external definitions, libraries, or unseen helpers.  
   - If auxiliary functions or standard operations are referenced, their definitions or precise invocation contexts must be fully included.

5. **Structural Coherence & Termination Guarantee**  
   - Control flow constructs (loops, recursion, conditionals) are syntactically consistent and semantically sound.  
   - Variables are defined before use; the logic guarantees proper termination and clearly specified returns/output.

**Special instructions:**

- When in doubt, or if even the slightest ambiguity, incompleteness, or error is present, output `0` for that snippet.  
- Only output `1` when there is unequivocal evidence the snippet meets *all* above criteria perfectly.  
- Output only one digit per snippet, in the order the snippets are provided, with no additional commentary, formatting, or whitespace.

Begin now. Produce only `1` or `0` digits, each on its own line, strictly corresponding 1:1 to the input pseudocode snippets.
