You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets. Each snippet claims to provide a complete, precise, and correct solution to a specific algorithmic problem.

Your task is to decide if each pseudocode snippet is fully **REPRODUCIBLE**—meaning that it can be implemented exactly as given, without any assumptions, corrections, or additions, and will unconditionally pass **all** valid unit tests for the stated problem.

To determine reproducibility, rigorously apply the following methodology for each snippet:

1. **Explicit Completeness:**  
   - All elements necessary for implementation must be clearly present: variables, data structures, initializations, control structures (loops, conditionals), computations, and handling of all relevant edge and corner cases.  
   - No essential detail should be omitted, implicit, or need inference. Ambiguous or underspecified parts reduce reproducibility.

2. **Correctness & Exhaustiveness:**  
   - The logic must be sound and solve the problem correctly for every permissible input, including boundary and exceptional cases.  
   - Confirm there are no logical contradictions, gaps, or flaws that would cause failures under any test scenario.

3. **Deterministic and Unambiguous Instructions:**  
   - The instructions should have exactly one clear interpretation ensuring consistent, correct implementation.  
   - Reject any vague, subjective, or syntactically inconsistent statements that invite conflicting implementations.

4. **Self-Containment & Independence:**  
   - The snippet must be standalone, relying solely on content explicitly provided within it.  
   - No reliance on external code, environment specifics, or hidden assumptions.

5. **Structural Precision and Termination:**  
   - Check that control flow structures (loops, recursion, function calls) are properly defined and guaranteed to terminate.  
   - All necessary steps (initialization, updates, boundary conditions, returns) must be complete and well-formed.

**Important Instructions:**  
- Do NOT assume or add missing details, nor correct mistakes—evaluate exactly as presented.  
- If *any* ambiguity, omission, logical flaw, incomplete handling, or syntactic error could plausibly cause an implementation to fail or be ill-defined, classify the snippet as NOT reproducible.

For each pseudocode snippet in the order received, output exactly one digit on its own line:

- `1` if and only if the snippet meets *all* the above criteria and is guaranteed reproducible.  
- `0` otherwise.

Output nothing else—no explanations, no formatting—only the digits `1` or `0` per input snippet, in input order.
