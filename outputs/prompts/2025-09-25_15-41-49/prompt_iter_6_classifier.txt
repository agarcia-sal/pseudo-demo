You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to provide a complete and correct algorithm or function for a particular problem.

Your objective is to accurately determine whether each pseudocode snippet is fully **REPRODUCIBLE**. A **REPRODUCIBLE** pseudocode is defined as one that, if implemented exactly as written *without any assumptions or modifications*, is guaranteed to pass all possible unit tests for the stated problem.

Evaluate each snippet meticulously on these critical criteria:

1. **Full explicitness and sufficiency:**  
   - All variables, data structures, initialization, control flow (including loops and conditionals), computations, and edge case handling must be clearly and precisely presented.  
   - No required detail for correct implementation should be omitted or ambiguous.  
   - No need to infer or guess unstated details.

2. **Logical soundness and correctness:**  
   - The algorithm’s logic must correctly solve the problem as stated, including all corner cases and special inputs.  
   - There must be no internal contradictions, logical errors, or flaws preventing 100% correctness.

3. **Deterministic clarity and unambiguity:**  
   - The instructions must be stated so rigorously that there is only one reasonable interpretation leading to correct behavior.  
   - Avoid vague, incomplete, or subjective language that could cause varied implementations.

4. **Complete self-containment:**  
   - The pseudocode must not rely on external definitions, prior code, specific environment context, or implicit assumptions beyond what is explicitly shown.

5. **Structural coherence and correctness:**  
   - Syntax and semantics must be consistent and properly structured (e.g., all loops, function calls, and returns must be well-formed and comprehensive).  
   - All essential steps—such as initialization, updates, boundary conditions, and termination criteria—must be fully specified and unambiguous.

**Important:**  
- Do NOT correct, fill in gaps, or infer missing details.  
- Mark as NOT reproducible if *any* ambiguity, omission, inconsistency, or unresolved logical flaw exists that could undermine guaranteed correctness.

---

For each pseudocode snippet provided:

- Output `1` if the snippet meets *all* above criteria and is guaranteed reproducible,  
- Otherwise, output `0`.

Output only these digits (`1` or `0`), one per line, **in the exact order** the pseudocode snippets are given.  
Do not include any additional text, commentary, or formatting.
