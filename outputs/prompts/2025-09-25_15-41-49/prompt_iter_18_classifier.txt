```
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully specify a complete solution for some computational problem.

Your task is to evaluate each snippet **independently** and output a single digit per snippet indicating whether it is **REPRODUCIBLE** — meaning if implemented exactly as written, without any external assumptions, additions, or clarifications, it will pass **all** relevant unit tests flawlessly.

**Output:**  
- `1` if the pseudocode is unquestionably reproducible  
- `0` if it lacks completeness, clarity, correctness, or any other aspect that prevents it from passing all unit tests  

Output exactly one digit per pseudocode snippet in input order, each on its own line, with no extra commentary, whitespace, or formatting.

To make a confident and precise decision, carefully verify all of the following requirements **without making any unstated inferences or guesses**:

1. **Explicit Completeness and Definitiveness**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, and data structures are clearly declared or unambiguously implied.  
   - Every operational step needed for a correct implementation is fully and explicitly described, including all initializations, loops, branches, function calls, and return statements.  
   - Handling of all edge cases and special inputs is fully incorporated or clearly derivable without assumption.  
   - No fragments, partial descriptions, vague terms, or inconsistencies that require interpretation or supplement.

2. **Correctness of Algorithmic Logic**  
   - The logic is correct and complete for every valid input, including boundary conditions and corner cases.  
   - No internal contradictions, errors, infinite loops, unreachable code, or undefined states that would cause incorrect outputs or runtime failures.  
   - Mentally simulate the algorithm with representative typical and boundary examples to confirm flawless logic.

3. **Unambiguous and Precise Expression**  
   - Each operation, condition, and control flow is stated with rigor and clarity, ensuring only one deterministic, straightforward implementation.  
   - No ambiguous variable scopes, inconsistent indexing, unclear data manipulations, or undefined operator semantics.

4. **Self-Sufficiency and Independence**  
   - The snippet is completely standalone; no undeclared helper functions, libraries, or external context are referenced.  
   - If auxiliary procedures or standard functions are invoked, their full explicit definitions or invocation contexts are included.

5. **Consistent Structure and Well-Formed Semantics**  
   - Control constructs and data manipulations follow a consistent, logical, and syntactically well-formed flow appropriate for typical pseudocode.  
   - Variables and data are initialized before use; all loops and recursive calls are guaranteed to terminate with correct outputs.

6. **Deterministic, Complete, and Explicit Output Specification**  
   - The output(s) — including data type, format, and value — are fully and clearly specified.  
   - Return or output statements are unambiguous and definitive, with no conditional or partial outputs that might yield uncertain final results.

**Strict Judgment Rule:**  
If **any** uncertainty, missing element, ambiguity, logical flaw, structural inconsistency, or assumption is required to understand or implement the snippet, output `0`.  
Output `1` only if **every criterion is met unquestionably** and the snippet can be directly and reliably implemented to pass all tests.

Begin immediately and provide only the requested digit outputs, in order, one per line.
