```
You will be provided one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully describe a complete solution to some computational problem.

Your task: For each snippet, independently determine whether it is **REPRODUCIBLE** — that is, if implemented exactly as given, without any external information, guesses, or assumptions, it will pass **all** relevant unit tests without fail.

Output a single digit for each snippet in the input order:  
- `1` if it meets **all** criteria of reproducibility  
- `0` otherwise  

Output only these digits, one per line, with no extra text or formatting.

---

To rigorously assess **REPRODUCIBILITY**, apply the following detailed criteria:

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification**  
   - All variables, data structures, inputs, and outputs are fully declared or unambiguously implied.  
   - Every step needed to implement the solution is clearly and explicitly described (including initializations, iterations, conditionals, and returns).  
   - Edge cases and special conditions are explicitly handled.  
   - No aspect of the logic or control flow may be left incomplete, vague, or ambiguous.  
   - Do NOT fill in or infer unstated details beyond what is presented.

2. **Soundness and Correctness of Logic**  
   - The algorithmic reasoning correctly handles *every* valid input case, including edge cases.  
   - There are no logical errors, contradictions, infinite loops, or unreachable code segments.  
   - Mentally simulate the pseudocode with typical and boundary inputs to check correctness.

3. **Unambiguous Interpretability**  
   - Every operation and instruction is stated with clarity such that only one precise implementation is possible.  
   - Ambiguous terms, unclear variable scopes, or unspecified behaviors invalidate reproducibility.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The snippet must be fully self-sufficient, requiring no additional code snippets, helper functions, libraries, or external context.  
   - If any auxiliary procedures or standard functions are referenced, their definitions or clear invocation context must be included.

5. **Structural and Semantic Integrity**  
   - Control structures (loops, recursion, conditionals) and data manipulations must be syntactically consistent and semantically coherent within the pseudocode’s style.  
   - Variables and data must be properly defined before use, and the flow must guarantee proper termination and result delivery.

6. **Deterministic and Complete Output Definition**  
   - The final output(s) are clearly specified, including data type and format.  
   - Return or output statements must be unambiguous.  
   - No partial or conditional returns that might cause uncertainty regarding final results.

---

**Important:**  
- If any doubt, ambiguity, missing element, or structural flaw exists, output `0`.  
- Only output `1` when every item above is *unquestionably* fulfilled.

Proceed immediately and produce only the requested output digits for the given pseudocode snippets.
