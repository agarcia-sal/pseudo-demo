```
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets. Each snippet claims to provide a **complete** solution to an unspecified computational problem.

Your exclusive task is to classify each pseudocode independently as either **REPRODUCIBLE (1)** or **NOT REPRODUCIBLE (0)** based on whether it would, if implemented exactly as written and without any external assumptions or corrections, unconditionally pass **all** relevant unit tests for its intended problem.

---

To decide reproducibility, exhaustively evaluate each snippet against the following five pillars, applying the strictest standard without any inference, guessing, or supplementation beyond the text:

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification:**  
   - Every variable, data structure, function, and constant must be fully declared and defined.  
   - Initialization, input/output mechanisms, edge case handling, and return values must be explicitly present.  
   - No part of the logic or structure can be missing, vague, or only implied.  
   - Do NOT fill in gaps or clarify ambiguous parts; lack of full clarity and completeness means NOT reproducible.

2. **Correct and Robust Algorithmic Logic:**  
   - The pseudocode must unerringly implement an algorithm that correctly solves the problem for **all valid inputs**, including edge and corner cases.  
   - The logic must guarantee termination, avoid infinite loops, handle exceptions, and maintain consistency.  
   - Mentally simulate major execution paths to verify correctness and coverage without contradictions or errors.

3. **Absolute Unambiguity and Determinism:**  
   - The instructions must be precise and leave no room for multiple interpretations or implementation variants that could cause failures.  
   - Any ambiguous, contradictory, or undefined operations immediately disqualify reproducibility.

4. **Full Self-Containment and No Hidden Dependencies:**  
   - The pseudocode snippet must stand alone with zero dependence on unspecified external code, libraries, runtime environment, or unstated assumptions.  
   - All helper functions, utilities, and constants required to implement the full logic must be included or clearly defined.  
   - Lack of explicit initialization, missing auxiliary code portions, or incomplete context means NOT reproducible.

5. **Syntactic and Semantic Integrity:**  
   - Control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion), data manipulations, and return statements must be syntactically well-formed and semantically coherent within the pseudocode style.  
   - The flow of execution must be logical and clearly lead to termination with properly set outputs, avoiding dead ends or unreachable code.

---

**Important:**  
- Under no circumstances supply missing details, assume usual programming semantics beyond what’s stated, or “fix” ambiguous descriptions.  
- Classify as reproducible (`1`) **only if** every condition above is conclusively satisfied beyond any doubt. Otherwise, classify as not reproducible (`0`).

---

**Output format:**  
Output a single digit per pseudocode snippet — `1` if reproducible, `0` otherwise.  
Output the digits in the same order as the input snippets, each on its own line, with **no extra commentary, explanation, or formatting**.
