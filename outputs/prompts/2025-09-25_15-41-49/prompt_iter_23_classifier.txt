You will receive one or more independent pseudocode snippets, each purportedly describing a complete algorithmic solution to a computational problem.

Your task: For each pseudocode snippet, determine **strictly and unambiguously** whether it is **REPRODUCIBLE** — meaning that if implemented exactly as presented, without adding, assuming, or inferring any details beyond what is explicitly stated, it would pass **all** relevant unit tests without failure.

Output one digit per snippet, preserving input order:  
- Output `1` if *all* conditions for reproducibility below are **fully satisfied**.  
- Otherwise, output `0`.  

Produce only the digits, one per line, with no additional text, formatting, or explanation.

---

To decide reproducibility, rigorously apply the following criteria. Any doubt or unclear aspect mandates output `0`.

1. **Full Completeness and Explicitness**  
   - All variables, data structures, inputs, outputs, and intermediate states are fully specified or clearly implied by precise language.  
   - Initialization, iteration ranges, base cases, conditionals, updates, and exact output format must be described concretely.  
   - Edge cases and exceptional conditions must be explicitly addressed or shown to be logically handled.  
   - No part of the algorithm should require guessing, unstated defaults, or assumptions beyond what is given.

2. **Logical Correctness and Comprehensive Handling**  
   - The pseudocode’s logic correctly covers all valid input scenarios, including boundary and corner cases.  
   - Control flow must terminate appropriately; no infinite loops or unreachable code fragments.  
   - Algorithmic steps must align with known correct approaches or be internally consistent upon rigorous mental simulation.  
   - Arithmetic, indexing, data mutations, and return values must be reliably derived.

3. **Unambiguous and Precise Language**  
   - Each operation and statement admits exactly one clear implementation interpretation.  
   - No vague terms, ambiguous scopes, or conflicting definitions allowed.  
   - Expression syntax, data access, and control structures must be fully decipherable without interpretation gaps.

4. **Complete Self-Containment**  
   - The snippet must be standalone: not dependent on omitted helper functions, external libraries, implicit environment assumptions, or hidden context.  
   - Referenced subroutines or standard library functions must be defined or explained sufficiently to implement correctly.

5. **Structural Validity and Semantic Coherence**  
   - Loop counters, recursion, conditionals, and state updates must be consistent and well-structured.  
   - Variables and data elements are declared/defined before use and are used in semantically valid ways.  
   - The pseudocode’s style is syntactically intact within its chosen conventions.

6. **Clear, Deterministic Output Specification**  
   - Outputs or returned values must be precisely defined with data types and formats stated unambiguously.  
   - There must be exactly one well-defined final output (or set of outputs); partial or conditional outputs that cause uncertainty invalidate reproducibility.

---

**Explicit instructions:**  
- If *any* of the above criteria is unmet, output `0`.  
- Only if *all* are unquestionably met, output `1`.  
- Do not produce any output other than the required digits.  
- Maintain the order of outputs consistent with input snippets.
