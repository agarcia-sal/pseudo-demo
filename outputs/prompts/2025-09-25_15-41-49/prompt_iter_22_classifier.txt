You will be provided one or more pseudocode snippets. Each snippet claims to fully specify a solution to a computational problem.

Your task is to independently evaluate each snippet and determine if it is **REPRODUCIBLE**. A snippet is **REPRODUCIBLE** if, when implemented exactly as given—without any assumptions, external information, or guesswork—it will pass **all** relevant unit tests in every scenario, including edge cases.

For each snippet, output exactly one digit on its own line, in the input order:  
- Output `1` if the snippet is unquestionably reproducible (i.e., fully specified, logically correct, unambiguous, self-contained, and guaranteed to produce correct outputs for all valid inputs).  
- Output `0` otherwise.

Output **only** these digits, with no extra commentary, formatting, or whitespace.

To determine reproducibility, apply the following rigorous criteria:

1. **Absolute Completeness and Explicitness**  
   - All variables, data structures, inputs, outputs, and constants must be explicitly declared or unequivocally inferable from the snippet alone.  
   - Every necessary operation, assignment, control structure, and return/output statement must be fully detailed; no steps, initializations, or conditions can be omitted or left vague.  
   - Handling of all edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, special conditions) must be explicit or clearly implied without assumptions.  

2. **Logical Correctness for All Inputs**  
   - The pseudocode’s logic must correctly solve the problem in every valid case without contradictions, infinite loops, or unreachable code.  
   - Mentally simulate the code on typical, boundary, and corner cases to confirm correctness systematically.  
   - Partial correctness or logic that fails even a subset of cases means not reproducible.  

3. **Unambiguous Interpretation and Implementation**  
   - Every operation, control flow, and data transformation must be described clearly and precisely to allow only one correct, deterministic implementation—no ambiguous terms, undefined behaviors, or unclear variable scopes.  
   - Avoid relying on implicit language features or external conventions not stated within the snippet.

4. **Self-Containment and Zero External Dependency**  
   - The snippet must be fully self-sufficient: no references to undefined functions, missing helper code, external libraries, or contexts outside the snippet itself.  
   - If auxiliary procedures or standard functions are invoked, their behavior and invocation context must be clear or explicitly defined.  

5. **Structural and Semantic Integrity**  
   - Control structures (loops, recursion, conditionals) must be syntactically coherent and semantically sound within the pseudocode’s style.  
   - Variables and data must be declared and initialized before use; the flow must ensure termination and delivery of the specified output.  

6. **Deterministic and Fully Specified Output**  
   - The output format, data types, and values must be precisely defined (e.g., return types, output ordering, removal of leading zeros).  
   - There must be a single, unambiguous return or output statement that corresponds exactly to the problem requirements.  

---

**Strict instructions:**  
- Do NOT infer unstated details, fill in missing logic, or assume typical programming language defaults.  
- If you detect any gap, conflict, ambiguity, missing case, or unclear definition, output `0`.  
- Only output `1` if *every* aspect of reproducibility above is indisputably satisfied.

Proceed to evaluate each snippet now. Output only the sequence of digits (one per line) corresponding to each snippet’s reproducibility, preserving their input order.
