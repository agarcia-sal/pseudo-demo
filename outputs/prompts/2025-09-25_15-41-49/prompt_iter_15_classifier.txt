You will be provided with one or more pseudocode snippets, each claimed to fully specify a correct and complete solution for a computational problem.

For each snippet, independently determine if it is **REPRODUCIBLE** — meaning that it can be implemented exactly as given, with no assumptions, inferences, or external additions, and will **always correctly and unambiguously pass all relevant unit tests for the problem without fail**.

To accurately assess **REPRODUCIBILITY**, use the following rigorous criteria:

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification:**  
   - Every variable, data structure, initial value, parameter, function, loop, conditional, and return statement must be fully declared or defined with explicit detail.  
   - All edge cases and exceptional inputs must be clearly addressed.  
   - No part of the algorithm’s behavior should require guessing, extrapolation, or external information not present in the snippet.

2. **Consistently Correct and Sound Logic:**  
   - The pseudocode’s algorithm must correctly and completely solve the problem for **every valid input**, including corner cases, without logical errors, infinite loops, or contradictions.  
   - Validate by mentally or logically simulating the pseudocode, confirming that outputs always satisfy the problem requirements.

3. **Precise, Unambiguous, and Deterministic Instructions:**  
   - The snippet must use clear, well-defined operations and constructs that admit exactly one implementation interpretation leading to correct behavior.  
   - Avoid vagueness, ambiguous language, undefined or inconsistent operations, or implicit behaviors.

4. **Fully Self-Contained and Independent:**  
   - The snippet must not rely on any external code, environment, predefined libraries, or context beyond what is explicitly stated.  
   - All necessary helpers, initializations, and definitions must be included or clearly specified.

5. **Syntactically and Semantically Cohesive Structure:**  
   - Control flow statements (loops, conditionals, recursion) and computations must be consistently and coherently formed with no semantic contradictions.  
   - The execution path must always reach a valid termination state producing the correct return value.  
   - No undefined variables or unreachable code.

**Additional instructions:**  
- Do NOT attempt to correct, complete, or fill in missing or unclear parts of the pseudocode; if any ambiguity or incompleteness is found, mark the snippet as NOT reproducible (`0`).  
- Mark as reproducible (`1`) only if **all** of the above are unequivocally satisfied.  
- If a snippet passes close but is missing critical details or contains borderline ambiguous elements, mark as `0`.

---

**Output format:**  
For each pseudocode snippet, output a single digit — `1` if reproducible or `0` if not — in the exact order the snippets are provided.  
Output exactly the digits only, each to its own line, with no extra spaces, comments, or formatting.

Begin your evaluation immediately upon receiving the pseudocode inputs.
