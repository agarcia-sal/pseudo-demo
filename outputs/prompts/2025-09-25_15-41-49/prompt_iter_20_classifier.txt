You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets. Each snippet claims to be a complete solution to an arbitrary computational problem.

Your task is to determine, for each snippet independently, whether it is **REPRODUCIBLE** — meaning that if implemented exactly as specified, **without adding, inferring, or modifying any part**, it will reliably pass **all** relevant unit tests.

**Output Requirements:**  
- For each snippet, output exactly one digit on its own line:  
  - Output `1` if the snippet is unquestionably reproducible.  
  - Output `0` if it is not.  
- Output only these digits, nothing else, in the same order as the input snippets.

---

**Definition of REPRODUCIBILITY:**  
A snippet is reproducible if and only if it simultaneously satisfies *all* of the following properties, with zero ambiguity or missing information:

1. **Full Explicitness and Completeness**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, and data structures are clearly named or fully described.  
   - Every step, including initializations, iterations, conditions, assignments, auxiliary procedures, and final returns (or outputs), is explicitly specified.  
   - There is no reliance on unstated assumptions, implicit knowledge, or missing definitions.  
   - Edge cases — including boundary inputs and exceptional scenarios — are either explicitly handled or logically implied without ambiguity.

2. **Logical Correctness and Soundness**  
   - The algorithm handles all valid inputs correctly, including edge cases that unit tests are likely to include.  
   - There are no logical contradictions, infinite loops without termination, or unreachable code sections.  
   - The flow of computation consistently leads to a defined final output for any valid input.

3. **Unambiguous Implementation Interpretation**  
   - Each statement, operation, and control structure is presented clearly so that it admits exactly one correct way of implementation.  
   - No vague terminology, inconsistent variable scopes, or undefined behaviors appear.  
   - All standard functions or methods used are either explicitly defined, or their semantics are universally standard and clear.

4. **Self-Contained and Independent**  
   - The snippet includes everything necessary to implement the solution on its own.  
   - No calls or references to external code, omitted helper functions, or libraries may be unresolved or undefined.

5. **Deterministic, Clearly Defined Output**  
   - The output or return values are completely specified in terms of data type, format, and structure.  
   - The snippet produces a single, deterministic output for any given input, without ambiguous or conditional incomplete returns.

6. **Consistent Semantic and Structural Integrity**  
   - Variables are always defined before use and the state changes follow logically and coherently.  
   - Control structures are well-formed, correctly nested, and semantically valid in the given pseudocode style.  
   - Data manipulations are consistent with declared data types and structures.

---

**Evaluation Approach:**  
- Mentally simulate the pseudocode with representative and boundary inputs to verify output correctness and logical consistency.  
- Do not infer or fill in missing details beyond what is explicitly provided.  
- If *any* uncertainty, ambiguity, missing definition, or logical flaw exists — even a minor one — classify the snippet as **not reproducible** (output `0`).

Proceed immediately. Provide only the required digit outputs (one per line) corresponding exactly to the order of the input pseudocode snippets.
