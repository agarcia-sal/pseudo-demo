You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to provide a complete solution to an unspecified computational problem.

For each snippet, independently determine whether it is **REPRODUCIBLE** — defined as the property that implementing the pseudocode exactly as given, with no additions, assumptions, or alterations, will cause the implementation to **pass every unit test relevant to the problem without exception**.

Your decision process must rigorously analyze the pseudocode according to these enhanced criteria:

1. **Complete Explicitness**  
   - Every necessary component must be fully and precisely declared and detailed: variables, data structures, initializations, control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals), return values, and handling of all corner and edge cases including trivial and boundary inputs.  
   - No element may be referenced without clear definition, or explained only implicitly or by assumption.  
   - Do not infer or fill in gaps; the pseudocode must stand entirely on its own as a complete blueprint.

2. **Logical and Semantic Correctness**  
   - Confirm that the algorithm’s logic, as described step-by-step in the pseudocode, correctly and thoroughly solves the problem for _all_ valid inputs — including obscure edge cases and boundary conditions.  
   - Identify and reject any logical flaws, contradictions, or infinite loops that would cause test failures or non-termination.  
   - Validate that all arithmetic, indexing, and data manipulations conform to expected semantics precisely.

3. **Unambiguity and Interpretability Without Guesswork**  
   - The instructions must admit exactly one clear interpretation; no vague language, ambiguous operators, implicit assumptions, or undefined behavior.  
   - Reject any snippet where multiple plausible implementations exist with differing correctness outcomes.  
   - Explicitly stated assumptions or usage of standard library functions must be supported by direct inclusion or precise definition in the pseudocode.

4. **Self-Containment Without External Dependencies**  
   - The solution must be fully self-contained; it cannot rely on external code, environmental state, unstated helper functions, or any context not present explicitly in the snippet.  
   - All auxiliary functions, constants, or data types referenced must be defined within the snippet.  
   - Implicit reliance on language-specific features (e.g., Python slicing, dictionary comprehensions) without corresponding pseudocode equivalents invalidates reproducibility.

5. **Structural and Execution Validity**  
   - Confirm consistent and coherent control flow with no dead code or unreachable branches.  
   - Verify variables are properly initialized before use and no side effects contradict intended data flow.  
   - Ensure that the execution always terminates in a valid return or output for every input from the defined input domain.

**Mandatory evaluation constraints:**  
- Do NOT attempt to correct, complete, or improve incomplete or partially ambiguous pseudocode. Mark such pseudocode as NOT reproducible (`0`).  
- ONLY mark as reproducible (`1`) if all above conditions are **unequivocally** and **completely** satisfied.

---

**Output format:**  
For each pseudocode snippet you evaluate, output exactly one digit on its own line:  
`1` if reproducible,  
`0` otherwise.  
The order of output digits must match the order in which the pseudocode snippets were given, with no extra text, whitespace, or commentary.

Begin evaluation immediately upon receipt of the pseudocode inputs.
