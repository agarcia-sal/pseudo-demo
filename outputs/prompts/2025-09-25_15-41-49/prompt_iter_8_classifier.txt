```
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each purporting to fully specify a complete solution for some computational problem.

Your task is to determine, for each snippet independently, whether it is truly **REPRODUCIBLE**, meaning that if implemented exactly as written, without any external assumptions, guesswork, or modifications, it will **unfailingly** pass **all** relevant unit tests for the indicated problem.

To decide **REPRODUCIBILITY**, rigorously apply the following evaluation framework:

1. **Explicit Completeness:**  
   - All essential elements must be fully and explicitly declared and defined, including variables, data structures, initial values, loop and conditional constructs, return statements, and edge case handling.  
   - No critical implementation detail can be missing, ambiguous, or implied implicitly.  
   - You must NOT supply or infer any information beyond what is clearly presented.

2. **Correctness of Logic:**  
   - The pseudocode’s algorithmic logic must correctly solve the stated problem for every valid input case, including all edge and corner cases, without error, infinite loops, or contradictions.  
   - Confirm correctness by mentally simulating or logically analyzing how the snippet processes inputs and produces outputs.

3. **Unambiguous Determinism:**  
   - The instructions must be so precise and clear that only one interpretation exists that leads to correct and complete implementation behavior.  
   - Vague specifications, undefined operations, or inconsistent constructs disqualify reproducibility.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence:**  
   - The snippet must be fully standalone: it cannot depend on any external code, context, environmental specifics, or definitions beyond what is explicitly included.  
   - Absence of required auxiliary functions, initializations, or specified standard library use counts as not reproducible.

5. **Structural and Semantic Validity:**  
   - Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion), data manipulation, and return values must be syntactically consistent within the pseudocode’s style and semantically coherent.  
   - The flow of execution must be complete and correctly terminate, with no logical dead ends or undefined variables.

**Important:**  
- Do NOT attempt to fix, complete, or improve ambiguous/incomplete pseudocode; mark such snippets as NOT reproducible (`0`).  
- Mark as reproducible (`1`) only if every aspect above is unequivocally satisfied.

**Output instructions:**  
For each input pseudocode snippet, output a single digit — `1` if reproducible, otherwise `0`.  
Output these digits in the exact order the pseudocode snippets are presented, each on its own line, with no additional text, commentary, or formatting.

Begin evaluation immediately upon receiving the pseudocode inputs.
