```
You will be given one or more pseudocode snippets, each describing a complete algorithm or function. For each pseudocode snippet, your task is to determine if it is fully REPRODUCIBLE—meaning it is detailed, unambiguous, and logically sufficient such that a correct implementation can be done directly from it that will pass 100% of the problem's unit tests.

Evaluate each snippet considering:

1. **Syntactic clarity**: The pseudocode should have clear and consistent syntax, with no contradictory or incomplete instructions.

2. **Semantic completeness**: All variables, operations, control flows, data structures, and boundary conditions necessary to implement the solution are explicitly defined or clearly implied without requiring assumptions.

3. **Logical correctness**: The algorithm correctly solves the problem as specified, including handling of edge cases and proper boundary conditions.

4. **Determinism**: No ambiguity or vagueness exists that would cause divergent or incomplete interpretations.

5. **No unstated dependencies**: The snippet does not rely on external knowledge, hidden assumptions, or behaviors not fully described within it.

Do NOT assume or infer any missing details beyond what is explicitly provided. Do NOT attempt to debug or correct errors—if the pseudocode as given is incomplete, ambiguous, or logically flawed, it is NOT reproducible.

For each pseudocode snippet, output exactly one line with a single digit:

- `1` if the pseudocode is reproducible (i.e., guaranteed to pass all unit tests if correctly implemented), else

- `0` if it is not reproducible.

Output your answers in the exact order the pseudocodes are provided. Do not output any explanations, remarks, or extra text—only the digits 0 or 1, one per line.
