```
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each purportedly a full, standalone solution to a computational problem.

For each snippet, output a single digit on its own line:
- `1` if the snippet is fully **REPRODUCIBLE**: implementing it exactly as written, without adding, inferring, or assuming any information, will cause it to pass **all** relevant unit tests reliably.
- `0` otherwise.

No additional text, formatting, or explanation should be produced. Output digits must be in the same order as the input snippets.

---

To determine **REPRODUCIBILITY**, rigorously verify all the following aspects with no exceptions:

1. **Complete and Explicit Detailing**  
   - Every variable, data structure, input, output, and intermediate value must be fully defined or explicitly inferable with a single clear interpretation.  
   - All control structures—such as loops, conditionals, and recursion—must be fully specified including start/end conditions and indexing details.  
   - Initialization steps, updates, and final return or output statements must be explicitly and unambiguously stated.  
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions are visibly handled or inherently covered by the logic.  
   - No essential detail (types, sizes, scopes, base cases, termination criteria) may be omitted or left vague.

2. **Logical Soundness and Correctness**  
   - The algorithm must correctly solve the stated computational problem for every valid input—including typical, boundary, and edge cases—without logical errors or contradictions.  
   - There must be no possibility of infinite loops, dead code, or unreachable instructions under any valid input or during normal execution flow.  
   - The correctness of arithmetic, comparisons, and data manipulations must hold universally as stated.  
   - Simulate the pseudocode mentally or with examples to ensure behavior aligns exactly with expected results.

3. **No Ambiguity in Interpretation**  
   - Each step in the pseudocode must have exactly one unambiguous meaning and implementation path.  
   - All symbols, operators, functions, and notations must be defined or standard enough that no alternative interpretations exist.  
   - Variable scopes, indexing bases (0-based or 1-based), and data formats must be explicit or clearly implied and consistently applied.  
   - If auxiliary functions or libraries are invoked, their complete definitions or specifications must be included within the snippet or described in full.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The snippet must contain everything needed to implement the solution end-to-end.  
   - No external code, helper routines, or supplementary explanations beyond what is in the snippet may be required.  
   - References to standard functions or data structures must be accompanied by clear usage details or definitions sufficient for unambiguous implementation.

5. **Deterministic and Well-Defined Output**  
   - Output(s) or return values must be precisely specified in terms of data type, format, and content.  
   - The final output must be unequivocal, with no conditional or partial results that could differ by interpretation or partial execution.  
   - The return must be guaranteed for all valid inputs.

6. **Consistency and Structural Integrity**  
   - The pseudocode must be syntactically and semantically consistent throughout.  
   - Variables or data are never used before declaration or initialization.  
   - Control flow guarantees termination and proper progression without contradictions, infinite loops, or gaps.  
   - Any form of recursion or iteration must be clearly bounded or include base/termination conditions.

---

**Important:**  
- If you detect any missing detail, ambiguity, implicit assumption, logical flaw, or incompleteness, output `0` for that snippet.  
- Output `1` only if every single criterion above is unquestionably met — meaning the snippet fully and precisely specifies an algorithm that passes all tests if implemented exactly as given, nothing more or less.

Begin immediately and produce only the digits (one per snippet), in the order given.
