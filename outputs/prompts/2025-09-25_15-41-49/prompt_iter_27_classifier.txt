```
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each purportedly describing a complete solution to some computational problem.

For each snippet, your task is to decide if it is strictly **REPRODUCIBLE**, meaning:

- If implemented exactly as written—without filling in gaps, guessing missing details, or making assumptions beyond the given pseudocode—it will correctly pass **all** relevant unit tests (including edge cases and boundary conditions).

---

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**  
Output a single digit per snippet, in the given order:  
- `1` if and only if the snippet meets **every** criterion for full reproducibility  
- `0` otherwise  

Output strictly these digits only, one per line, with no additional text, explanation, or formatting.

---

**DETAILED CRITERIA FOR REPRODUCIBILITY:**  

Apply all the following checks rigorously and conservatively. Even a single unresolved ambiguity, missing element, or plausible logical flaw means output `0`.

1. **Completeness and Explicitness**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, and control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals, initializations, returns) are explicitly and fully defined or clearly implied without guesswork.  
   - Any required helper procedures, library functions, or standard operations are either defined or sufficiently described in scope and usage so they can be precisely implemented.  
   - Edge cases and exceptional scenarios (empty inputs, boundary values, special conditions) are explicitly addressed or logically entailed by the pseudocode.  
   - No implicit assumptions: Do not infer or supply missing details yourself.

2. **Logical Soundness and Correctness**  
   - The algorithm correctly handles **all** valid inputs, including typical inputs, edge cases, and corner cases.  
   - There are no logical contradictions, infinite loops, unreachable code, or ambiguous branching.  
   - Mentally simulate (or reason through) the pseudocode on standard, edge, and boundary inputs to ensure correctness.

3. **Unambiguous Semantics and Syntax**  
   - Every operation, assignment, conditional, loop construct, and data manipulation is described clearly with exactly one sensible interpretation.  
   - Variable scopes, types (explicit or clearly implied), and control flow are unambiguously stated.  
   - No vague terms, conflicting statements, or missing control paths that would cause implementation uncertainty.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The snippet is fully self-sufficient: it does not depend on any external code, context, or undocumented assumptions.  
   - If calling auxiliary functions or referencing standard components, those are fully specified or defined within the snippet or standard (well-known and unambiguous) functions.

5. **Deterministic Output and Termination**  
   - The output format, type, and value are precisely defined, with no conditional or partial returns that could yield ambiguous final results.  
   - The pseudocode guarantees termination with a well-defined result.

---

**STRICT GUIDANCE:**  
- When in doubt, choose reproducibility `0`.  
- Output `1` only if you can confirm **without any doubt** that the pseudocode is fully reproducible according to all the above.  
- Do not produce explanations, notes, or any extra output beyond the required digits.
