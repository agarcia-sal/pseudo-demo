```
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each representing a purportedly complete solution to a computational problem.

Your task is to evaluate each snippet **independently** and determine if it is **REPRODUCIBLE** — meaning that if implemented exactly as presented (without external assumptions, omitted details, or any guesswork), it will **pass all relevant unit tests** consistently.

For each snippet, output **only a single digit on its own line**:  
- `1` if the pseudocode unambiguously meets **all** criteria for reproducibility and correctness.  
- `0` if it fails to meet even one criterion.

---

**To decide reproducibility, apply the following rigorous criteria:**

1. **Completeness & Explicitness**  
   - The pseudocode fully specifies all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, and initialization steps.  
   - All control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion) and logic steps are explicitly and completely described.  
   - No reliance on external code, helper functions, or unspecified library functions unless their behavior and implementation are fully defined in the snippet.  
   - Edge cases, boundary conditions, and special inputs must be explicitly addressed or inherently handled by the logic.  
   - Avoid inferring or filling in any unstated details; any ambiguity in required details invalidates reproducibility.

2. **Logical Correctness & Soundness**  
   - The algorithm must correctly handle all valid inputs and edge cases without logical contradictions, infinite loops, or dead code.  
   - Control flow must guarantee termination and produce consistent results for every input.  
   - Mentally simulate the algorithm on typical and boundary cases to confirm correctness.

3. **Unambiguous and Precise Interpretation**  
   - Each operation, condition, and data manipulation is defined sufficiently to allow exactly one clear interpretation.  
   - Avoid ambiguous variable scopes, unclear indexing, vague operations, or inconsistent data manipulations.  
   - The pseudocode should not introduce notation or wording that could be interpreted differently by an implementer.

4. **Self-Containment & Independence**  
   - The snippet stands alone as a complete solution; no external context, code, or undocumented assumptions are needed.  
   - If external concepts or standard functions appear, they must be fully defined or their exact implementation and effects clearly provided.

5. **Output Definitiveness**  
   - Final outputs (values returned or produced) must be clearly specified including type, format, and any transformations (like trimming zeros, formatting strings).  
   - Return or output statements must be unconditional and unambiguous — no partial, conditional, or unspecified returns that could produce inconsistent results.

---

**Strict Instructions:**  
- If any criterion above is even slightly unmet or questionable, output `0` for that snippet.  
- Output only the single digit per snippet and nothing else — no explanations, no extra formatting, no summaries.  
- The output order must strictly correspond to the pseudocode input order.
