```
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each purporting to be a complete and executable solution to a computational problem.

Your task: For each snippet, determine if it is **REPRODUCIBLE** — meaning that an exact implementation following the pseudocode, without any assumptions, external information, or guesswork, will successfully pass **all** relevant unit tests.

Output Requirements:  
- For each snippet, output a single digit on its own line:  
  - `1` if it is reproducible as defined  
  - `0` if it is not  
- Output digits must appear in the same order as the snippets are given, with no additional text, commentary, or formatting.

---

To decide reproducibility, rigorously verify these criteria:

1. **Explicit Completeness and Definiteness**  
   - All inputs, variables, data structures, and outputs must be clearly and fully specified or unambiguously implied to enable direct implementation.  
   - Every step of the process—including initializations, loops, recursion, conditionals, updates, and final return/output statements—must be clearly and exhaustively defined.  
   - Handling of all edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios must be explicitly described.  
   - No crucial detail (e.g., data types, loop ranges, indexing, variable scopes) may be vague, missing, or rely on implicit assumptions.  
   - Under no circumstance should you infer or supply unstated logic, default values, or behaviors beyond the text.

2. **Logical Correctness and Robustness**  
   - The described algorithm must correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs, without logical errors (wrong computations, misapplied conditions, or faulty control flow).  
   - It must not contain contradictions, infinite loops, non-terminating recursion, or unreachable code segments.  
   - Mentally execute the pseudocode on representative typical and boundary inputs to confirm correctness and handling of special cases.

3. **Unambiguous Syntax and Semantics**  
   - Every instruction and operation must be stated clearly and precisely so that exactly one implementation interpretation is possible.  
   - Ambiguity in operations, unclear variable usage, or unspecified control structure semantics invalidates reproducibility.  
   - Pseudocode style and notation must be consistent and clear enough to translate directly into working code.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The snippet must be fully self-sufficient: it cannot depend on any external code, libraries, context, or helper functions unless those are fully defined within the snippet itself.  
   - If standard or auxiliary functions are referenced, their definitions or clear invocation contexts must be present.

5. **Deterministic and Fully Specified Output**  
   - The output(s) must be clearly specified in terms of data type, format, and content.  
   - Return or output statements must be complete and unambiguous, guaranteeing a definitive, deterministic final result for any valid input.

6. **Structure, Style, and Termination Guarantees**  
   - Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) must be syntactically and semantically sound within the pseudocode’s style.  
   - Variables/data are always defined before use; control flow guarantees termination and eventual return/output.  
   - No partial or nested return points that could cause ambiguity about final output.

---

**Strict Decision Rule:**  
- If you identify **any** ambiguity, missing detail, logical flaw, unsupported assumption, or structural problem that could prevent guaranteed successful implementation and passing of all unit tests, output `0`.  
- Output `1` only when **every** item above is fully, precisely, and unquestionably satisfied.
