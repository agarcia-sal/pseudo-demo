You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets as input, each independently claiming to fully and precisely solve some computational problem.

Your task is to analyze each snippet carefully and determine whether it is **REPRODUCIBLE** — that is, if implemented exactly as provided, without any external assumptions, additions, or corrections, it will **unfailingly pass all unit tests associated with the problem**.

For each snippet, output a single digit on a separate line corresponding to the input order:

- Output `1` if the pseudocode is unquestionably reproducible.
- Output `0` otherwise.

**Output strictly these digits only, with no explanations, comments, or formatting.**

---

To decide reproducibility, rigorously apply all the following, without exception:

1. **Complete and Explicit Specification**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, and data structures are explicitly declared or clearly inferred with no ambiguity.  
   - Every action required to realize the solution is described in full, including initialization, loops, conditionals, recursion, and return statements.  
   - Edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, boundary sizes) and special conditions must be explicitly addressed.  
   - No detail can be omitted, vague, or require inference beyond what is written.

2. **Logical Correctness and Robustness**  
   - The pseudocode’s algorithm must correctly solve the problem for every valid input, including corner cases and pathological inputs.  
   - Ensure absence of logical errors, contradictions, infinite loops, or unreachable code blocks.  
   - Mentally simulate the snippet on representative test cases (normal, boundary, and extreme) to verify correctness.

3. **Unambiguous and Precise Semantics**  
   - Instructions and operations are described so clearly that only one concrete implementation interpretation is possible.  
   - No ambiguous terminology, unclear variable scopes, or fractal/missing definitions of operations or data types.  
   - The control flow and data manipulations adhere consistently to the stated pseudocode conventions.

4. **Self-Containment Without External Dependencies**  
   - The snippet stands entirely on its own: no external functions, libraries, data, or prior context outside those specified may be required.  
   - If auxiliary functions or standard algorithms are invoked, their definitions or precise invocation contexts must be included fully and unambiguously.

5. **Deterministic and Complete Output Definition**  
   - The output(s) must be clearly and fully defined in terms of format and data type.  
   - Return or output statements must deterministically produce exactly one final result without ambiguity or conditional partial returns.

6. **Structural Integrity and Flow Completeness**  
   - All variables are initialized before use; control structures (loops, recursion, conditionals) are syntactically and semantically consistent and guarantee termination.  
   - The data flow and control flow are coherent and sufficient to produce final output with no unresolved dependencies or gaps.

---

**Final decision rule:**  
Return `1` only if **all** above criteria are met without any uncertainty.  
Return `0` if there is any ambiguity, incompleteness, inconsistency, or reasonable doubt about reproducibility.

---

**IMPORTANT:**  
- Your judgment must be conservative: when in doubt or faced with any unclear or missing detail, output `0`.  
- No partial credit or deliberation text; only output a digit per input snippet.

Proceed immediately with these instructions.
