```
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets. Each snippet claims to fully specify a solution to a computational problem.

Your task: For each snippet, determine if it is **REPRODUCIBLE**. That means the snippet, if implemented exactly as written without adding, removing, or guessing any details, will pass **all** relevant unit tests in every edge and corner case.

Output exactly one digit per snippet, in the input order:  
- `1` if **unambiguously reproducible**  
- `0` otherwise  

**Output only these digits, one per line, with no extra text.**

To decide reproducibility, apply this rigorous checklist to each snippet with zero assumptions:

1. **Completeness and Explicitness**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, and return values are fully declared or clearly implied.  
   - Every necessary step for a fully working implementation is explicitly described.  
   - Initializations, data structure creations, loops, conditionals, recursive calls, and final outputs are completely specified.  
   - Edge cases and exceptional scenarios must be addressed explicitly or clearly implied.  
   - Do *not* infer or guess meanings, omitted steps, or missing initializations.

2. **Logical Correctness and Full Coverage**  
   - The logic correctly implements the intended algorithm and handles *all* valid inputs and their edge cases.  
   - No contradictions, logical errors, infinite loops, or dead code are present.  
   - Mentally simulate the code on typical and boundary inputs to check correctness.

3. **Clarity and Non-Ambiguity**  
   - The snippet is written so that only one precise implementation is possibleâ€”no ambiguous variable scopes, operation semantics, or control flow.  
   - Use of vague terms, unspecified behavior, or missing definitions renders the snippet non-reproducible.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The snippet stands alone and does not rely on unseen code, external libraries, or helper functions without definition.  
   - If helper methods or standard functions are called, their behavior or definitions must be clearly included or universally known and unambiguous.

5. **Structural and Semantic Soundness**  
   - Syntax and semantics of control structures (loops, recursion, conditionals) and data operations are consistent, well-formed, and coherent.  
   - Variables and data are properly initialized before use.  
   - The control flow guarantees proper termination and produces the required outputs.

6. **Deterministic and Fully-Specified Output**  
   - The output(s) of the algorithm are explicitly specified with clear data types and formats.  
   - Return/output statements are explicit, unambiguous, and deterministic.  
   - No conditional or partial return that might cause uncertainty about final results.

---

**Strict Decision Rule:**  
- If *any* doubt, ambiguity, incompleteness, or inconsistency is found, output `0`.  
- Output `1` *only* if *all* above criteria are unquestionably satisfied.

Proceed **immediately** and output only the digits in order corresponding to the input snippets.
