```
You will receive one or more pseudocode snippets, each intended as a fully self-contained, complete solution to an unspecified computational problem.

For each snippet, determine if it is strictly **REPRODUCIBLE** — that is, if directly implemented exactly as given (no assumptions, no external info, no modifications), it will pass **all** relevant unit tests reliably.

Output one digit per snippet in input order:
- `1` if the snippet is unquestionably reproducible
- `0` otherwise

Output must be exactly these digits, one per line, with no additional text, spaces, or formatting.

To decide reproducibility, verify the following conditions rigorously and absolutely:

1. **Completeness and Explicitness**  
   - All inputs, outputs, variables, and data structures must be fully and clearly declared or derivable with zero ambiguity.  
   - Every algorithmic step must be explicitly stated, including initializations, loop bounds, conditionals, and final returns.  
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions must be explicitly handled or clearly implied by stated logic.  
   - No key details, steps, or mechanisms required for implementation or correct execution may be missing or vague.  
   - No reliance on external functions, libraries, code snippets, or unstated helper routines unless fully defined in the snippet.

2. **Logical Correctness and Robustness**  
   - The presented algorithm must be logically sound and handle *every* valid input scenario correctly—including all edge and corner cases.  
   - No contradictions, unreachable steps, infinite loops, or incorrect handling of inputs should exist.  
   - Mentally simulate the pseudocode or reason through its control and data flows to assure correctness of outcomes in all cases.

3. **Unambiguous Interpretation and Determinism**  
   - Instructions and operations must be clearly and precisely stated so that exactly one deterministic implementation is possible.  
   - Avoid the use of ambiguous terms, unclear variable scopes, or unspecified behaviors that require guesswork or assumptions.  
   - All data manipulations, loop iterations, and returns must be deterministic and fully defined.

4. **Self-Containment and Independence**  
   - The snippet must be standalone and implementable without requiring any additional code, external data, or undefined functions.  
   - If it references standard or auxiliary functions, their behavior must be explicitly defined or perfectly standard and well understood.

5. **Structural Integrity and Semantic Coherence**  
   - Control structures like loops, conditionals, and recursion must be syntactically and semantically consistent within the pseudocode’s style and fully coherent.  
   - Variables and data must be correctly defined before use, updated properly, and consistent throughout the flow.  
   - Execution must always lead to proper termination and a definitive output.

6. **Clear, Complete, and Deterministic Output Definition**  
   - Output(s) must be explicitly identified, with their expected type and format fully stated or clearly implied.  
   - Return or output statements must be unambiguous and final, without partial or conditional outcomes causing uncertainty.

---

**If any uncertainty, ambiguity, omitted details, logical flaws, or structural issues exist, classify the snippet as not reproducible. Only label as reproducible when all conditions above hold beyond all doubt.**

Process all snippets carefully and output a single line of either `1` or `0` for each snippet, in input order, with no additional commentary or formatting.
