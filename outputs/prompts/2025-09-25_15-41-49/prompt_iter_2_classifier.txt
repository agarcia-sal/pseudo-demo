Given the pseudocode below, determine if it is *fully specified and unambiguous* with *complete, precise, and logically consistent instructions* sufficient to implement a correct solution that passes **all** relevant unit tests reliably. Specifically, verify that:

- **All inputs, outputs, and intermediate values are clearly defined and properly initialized.**  
- **All control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion, iterations) is logically sound and terminates appropriately.**  
- **All operations and expressions are valid and consistent with the stated data types and semantics.**  
- **No critical details or edge cases are omitted or ambiguous, such that the pseudocode can be directly translated into working code that passes every test case.**  
- **No implicit assumptions or vague statements exist that could cause divergence or failure under any test.**

Output a single integer:  
`1` if the pseudocode meets all the above criteria and thus is reproducible (guaranteed to pass all unit tests).  
Otherwise, output `0`.  
  
**Output only the integer(s) corresponding to the provided pseudocode(s), in the exact order given, with no extra characters, explanations, or content.**
