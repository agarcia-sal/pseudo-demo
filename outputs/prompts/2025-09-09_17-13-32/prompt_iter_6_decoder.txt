Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and production-quality Python code that:

- strictly preserves the original class names, function names, signatures, and data structures as stated in the pseudocode;
- implements the exact logic and control flow deduced from the pseudocode with accuracy and completeness;
- is robust, handles common edge cases thoughtfully, and follows Python best practices including type hints if present;
- avoids unnecessary or redundant code while ensuring high readability and maintainability;
- optimizes performance as much as possible under the 5-second execution constraint without sacrificing correctness or clarity;
- includes appropriate comments only where they clarify complex logic extracted from the pseudocode;
- refrains from adding any code or logic not supported or implied by the pseudocode;
- encloses all the resulting Python code strictly inside a single code block using triple backticks with the language specifier `python` as shown below:

```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

Do not include any explanations, extra formatting, separator lines, or text outside the code block.
