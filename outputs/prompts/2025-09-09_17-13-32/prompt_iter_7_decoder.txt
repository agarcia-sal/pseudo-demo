You will receive a piece of pseudocode describing a class with one or more functions/methods. Your task is to translate this pseudocode into correct, clean, idiomatic, and production-quality Python code that:

- strictly preserves all original class names, function/method names, signatures (including parameters and return types if given), and data structures exactly as indicated in the pseudocode;
- implements the exact logic and control flow described or implied by the pseudocode with absolute fidelity and completeness;
- handles typical edge cases and boundary conditions inherent or suggested by the pseudocode, ensuring robustness;
- follows Python best practices for style, readability, maintainability, and efficiency;
- uses type hints wherever present in the pseudocode or when it improves code clarity without assumptions beyond the pseudocode;
- avoids redundant, unnecessary, or superfluous code, but includes minimal comments only to elucidate complex or subtle logic explicitly described or necessary to faithfully interpret the pseudocode;
- optimizes for clear, concise, and performant Python code, respecting a 5-second runtime constraint without compromising correctness or readability;
- may use Pythonâ€™s standard library and well-known built-in packages if they simplify or improve the implementation without adding external dependencies;
- includes explicit initializations of all data structures to prevent common semantic bugs (e.g., using list comprehensions instead of repeated references to the same mutable object);
- does not invent or add any functionality, logic, optimizations, or assumptions not supported or clearly implied by the pseudocode;
- produces a complete, runnable Python code snippet containing all class(es) and function(s) shown in the pseudocode;
- encloses the entire resulting code strictly in a single fenced code block with the language specifier `python` as follows:

```python
# Your complete translated Python code here
```

Do not provide any text, explanation, comments outside the code block, separator lines, or additional formatting beyond the single requested code block.
