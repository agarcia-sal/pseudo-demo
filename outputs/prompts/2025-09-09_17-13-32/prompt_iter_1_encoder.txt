Translate the given problem description into concise, easy-to-read pseudocode using natural language and compact high-level constructs. Do not include any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not add notes, comments, or explanations. Use one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where possible. Follow this format for steps:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clear, straightforward pseudocode that readers can understand quickly. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
