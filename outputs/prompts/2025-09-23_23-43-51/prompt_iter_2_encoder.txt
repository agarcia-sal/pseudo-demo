Translate the given code into concise, high-level pseudocode preserving all original function and class names, as well as object and class hierarchies. Write pseudocode using natural language and clear variable names, employing standard programming keywords (e.g., FUNCTION, FOR, IF, RETURN) in uppercase. Use one statement per line without comments, explanations, summaries, or notes. Avoid low-level details and non-essential implementation specificsâ€”focus on abstract, readable steps. Maintain original control flow and operations, but express them with simple, descriptive phrases and common pseudocode conventions. Do not include separators or extra formatting beyond indentation to reflect structure. Output only the pseudocode without any additional text or markup.
