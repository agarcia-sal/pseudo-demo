Translate the provided pseudocode into clear, efficient, and idiomatic Python code, strictly preserving all given function names, class names, and their object structures exactly as stated in the pseudocode. Your implementation should be complete, runnable, and optimized to operate within a 5-second timeout. Use any standard Python libraries as needed to enhance clarity and performance. Enclose your entire code response solely within a single Python code block, formatted as follows:

```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

Do not include explanations, comments beyond what's necessary for clarity, or any additional text outside the code block. Avoid any separator lines or extraneous formatting. Focus on correctness, exact structural fidelity, readability, and efficiency in your translation.
