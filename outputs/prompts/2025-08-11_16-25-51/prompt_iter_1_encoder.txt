Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be high-level, using natural language, one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only direct pseudocode instructions. Format it step-by-step as numbered lines like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and compactness, avoiding verbosity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best result within this limit.
