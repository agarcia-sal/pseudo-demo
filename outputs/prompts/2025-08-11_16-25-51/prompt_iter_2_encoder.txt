Generate clear, compact, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the problem description, using mostly natural language at a high level. Use concise statements, favoring one-liners, symbolic notation (like ← for assignment), and common abbreviations where appropriate. Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, or purpose statements—output only the direct pseudocode steps. Number each line sequentially, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include separator lines or extra formatting beyond numbered lines. The pseudocode should focus on clarity and brevity while fully expressing the algorithm’s logic in a high-level natural language style. Your output should prioritize speed and simplicity to fit within a 5-second processing time.
