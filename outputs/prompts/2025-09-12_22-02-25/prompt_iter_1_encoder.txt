Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use easy-to-read, natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate. Present the pseudocode in a numbered list, using mostly one-liners. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, or comments—only the pseudocode itself.

Follow this format example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and compactness. Always prioritize returning the best possible result within a 5-second timeout.
