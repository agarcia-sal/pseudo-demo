Write concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode that directly implements the given problem as a function named exactly as in the original code.  
Produce compact, high-level pseudocode using mostly natural language with symbolic operators and abbreviations. Prefer one-line statements and minimal verbosity without sacrificing clarity.  
Use the original function and variable names consistently. Avoid comments, explanations, summaries, extra formatting, or separator lines—only numbered pseudocode lines.  
Indent nested blocks clearly with two spaces per level, following this style:  

1. in function FuncName(args)  
2.  let x ← 0  
3.  while x < n: x++  
4.  return result  

Favor idiomatic pseudocode constructs, natural expressions, and symbolic forms to keep code succinct yet readable. Use direct assignments, control flow, and expressions as in standard pseudocode.  
Return the best, most compact, and readable pseudocode possible within 5 seconds.
