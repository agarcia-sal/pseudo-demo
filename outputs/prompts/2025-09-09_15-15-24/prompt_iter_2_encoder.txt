Write clear, compact pseudocode for the problem described, adhering to these rules:

- Output only pseudocode—no explanations, comments, or summaries.  
- Keep the original function name and signature intact as in the source code.  
- Use natural yet concise language; prefer high-level constructs, one-liners, symbolic operators (←, =, ≠, +, -, *, /, mod), abbreviations, and standard control flow keywords.  
- Minimize verbosity; merge simple statements when suitable but keep code readable.  
- Format with numbered lines starting at 1; indent blocks with consistent spacing or tabs.  
- Use simple, consistent variable names reflecting the original when clear; otherwise, keep short descriptive names.  
- Use customary pseudocode conventions for loops, conditionals, function calls, arrays, and data structures.  
- Follow this style exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

- Do not add any separators, metadata, or extraneous formatting.  
- Aim for the most streamlined, understandable pseudocode possible within a 5-second generation limit.
