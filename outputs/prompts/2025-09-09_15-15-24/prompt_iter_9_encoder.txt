Write pseudocode that directly implements the given problem as a function named exactly as in the original code.  
Produce concise, clear, and elegant pseudocode prioritizing natural language with symbolic notations and terse abbreviations. Use mostly one-line statements and a high-level style without sacrificing clarity or correctness.  
Keep variable and function names unchanged from the original code.  
Do not include any comments, explanations, summaries, notes, or extra formatting—only pure pseudocode steps.  
Number each line starting from 1, using indentation to indicate code blocks, following this pattern:

1. in function FuncName(args)  
2.  x ← 0  
3.  while x < n: x++  
4.  return result

Favor idiomatic constructs, symbolic operators, and compact expressions where it improves readability without losing precision. Avoid decorative separators or extraneous whitespace.  
Aim for the simplest and most direct expression of the logic, balancing readability and brevity.  
Your output must be the pseudocode only; do not add anything else.  
Completion time must not exceed 5 seconds.
