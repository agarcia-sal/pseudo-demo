Write pseudocode to directly implement the given problem’s code as a function named exactly as in the original code.  
Produce clear, high-level, and compact pseudocode using mostly natural language enriched with symbolic forms and concise abbreviations. Prefer one-line statements and minimal verbosity without losing clarity.  
Do not include purpose, comments, explanations, summaries, or extra formatting—only the pseudocode steps.  
Use exact original function and variable names consistently.  
Number each line starting from 1. Use indentation to denote blocks, with a syntax style like:  

1. in function FuncName(args)  
2.  let x ← 0  
3.  while x < n: x++  
4.  return result  

Favor straightforward constructs, symbolic operators, and idiomatic pseudocode forms to keep it succinct yet easy to read. Avoid separator lines or decorative formatting.  
Generate the best possible concise and readable pseudocode within 5 seconds.
