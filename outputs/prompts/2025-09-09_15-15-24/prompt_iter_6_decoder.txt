Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, idiomatic Python code that preserves the exact logic and structure of the pseudocode.  
- Keep the function name and signature exactly as specified in the pseudocode.  
- Use standard Python conventions, including appropriate data types, control flow, and imports if needed.  
- Optimize your code for readability, correctness, and efficiency within a 5-second runtime limit.  
- You may import and use any standard Python library or module if it improves clarity or performance.  
- Do not include any explanation, comments, or additional text outside the code unless explicitly necessary for correctness or clarity (e.g., defining a helper data structure used in the code).  
- Wrap your entire code solution in one Python code block as shown below:  

```python
# your translated code here
```
