Write pseudocode that directly implements the given problem specification as a function with the **same name** as in the original code.  
Produce clear, compact, and high-level pseudocode using natural language with concise statements and symbolic forms where appropriate. Prefer one-line statements and abbreviations to maintain brevity.  
Do not include any purpose, explanation, comments, notes, or overview—only the pseudocode steps.  
Use the exact function and variable names as in the original code for consistency.  
Number each line and use indentation to denote blocks, following this style:  

1. in function FuncName(arguments)  
2.  let x ← 0  
3.  while x < n: x++  
4.  return result  

Avoid extra separators or formatting lines. Generate the best possible pseudocode within 5 seconds.
