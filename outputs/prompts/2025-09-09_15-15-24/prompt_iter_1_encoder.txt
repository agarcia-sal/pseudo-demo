Write pseudocode for the given problem description following these rules:  
- Do not include purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only pseudocode.  
- Use easy-to-read, understandable language that is compact and high-level.  
- Prefer concise pseudocode with one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where suitable.  
- Avoid verbose constructions; keep it streamlined.  
- Follow this formatting style with numbered lines and indentation for blocks:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your output should be solely the pseudocode fulfilling these constraints. Your function has a 5-second timeout; generate the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
