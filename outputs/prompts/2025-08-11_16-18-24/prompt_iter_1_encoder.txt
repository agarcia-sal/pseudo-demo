Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a compact, high-level style with natural language, symbolic representations, abbreviations, and prefer one-liner statements. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second runtime constraint.
