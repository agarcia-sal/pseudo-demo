Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations, keeping it compact and high-level. Write pseudocode only—do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations. Prefer one-liner statements where possible. Follow this numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Your pseudocode should clearly express the algorithm logic and flow within a 5-second response limit.
