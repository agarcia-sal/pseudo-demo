Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code with optimal runtime (under 5 seconds). Your code must:

- Use only `input()` for inputs without any prompt strings.
- Avoid print formatting other than direct values as required.
- Follow best Python practices for readability and performance.
- Include concise but clear comments where needed to explain complex logic.
- Handle edge cases robustly as implied by the pseudocode.
- Enclose the entire code within a single triple-backtick Python code block as follows:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Pseudocode:
```
