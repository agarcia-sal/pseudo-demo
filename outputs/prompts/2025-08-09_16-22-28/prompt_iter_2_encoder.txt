Generate clear, concise, and easy-to-understand pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language in a compact, high-level style, favoring concise one-liners, symbolic operators (e.g., ←, ++), and standard abbreviations. Do not include any purpose, summaries, explanations, comments, or notes—output only the pseudocode itself. Ensure the pseudocode is readable yet brief, using indentation to show structure. Follow this exact numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include separator lines or extra formatting. Avoid verbosity by merging simple statements where clear. Use conventional pseudocode constructs and terminology, adapting typical programming syntax into a clean, abstract style.

Example pseudocode style to emulate:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
