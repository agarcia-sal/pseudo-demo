Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a compact, high-level style with natural language, one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and readability without verbosity. Your function runs within a 5-second timeout; return the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
