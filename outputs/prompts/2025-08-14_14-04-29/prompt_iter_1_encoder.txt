Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should avoid purpose, summary, or overview statements and contain no comments or explanations. Use simple natural language, symbolic forms, and abbreviations where helpful. Keep it compact and high-level, favoring one-liners and clear control structures. Follow this numbering format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Produce only the pseudocode, nothing else. Your function runs under a 5-second timeout, so optimize for clarity and brevity within that limit.
