Generate concise, clear, and easily understandable pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language combined with symbolic notations and common abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Express control flow and operations clearly, favoring one-line statements where possible. Use intuitive variable names without defining types explicitly unless helpful. Do not include purpose, summaries, comments, explanations, or notes—only pseudocode lines.

Number each line starting at 1, following this precise format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Write pseudocode that is straightforward and efficiently expresses the algorithm structure using simple loops, conditionals, assignments, and function calls. Avoid unnecessary verbosity or detail; focus on clarity and brevity to ensure understanding within a 5-second runtime constraint.

Output only the numbered pseudocode lines, nothing else—no titles, separators, or extra text.
