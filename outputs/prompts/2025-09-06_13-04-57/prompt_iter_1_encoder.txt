Write pseudocode that directly implements the given problem without any purpose, summary, or overview statement. Do not include notes, comments, or explanations—only provide the pseudocode itself. Make it easy to read and understandable by using natural language, concise expressions, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Prefer compact, high-level steps and use one-liners when possible. Follow this format for numbered steps:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Produce the best possible concise pseudocode within a 5-second time limit.
