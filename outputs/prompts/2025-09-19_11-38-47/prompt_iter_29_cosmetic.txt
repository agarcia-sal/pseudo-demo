Given input pseudocode, generate a logically equivalent version that preserves all original class names, function names, signatures, and hierarchies *exactly* but differs maximally in every other aspect. Your rewritten pseudocode must:

- Maintain identical external behavior: outputs, side effects, edge cases, and computational complexity must remain unchanged  
- Keep all class and function names, return types, parameters, and visibility intact and unmodified  
- Completely rename all internal variables, data structures, temporaries, counters, and iterators with unrelated names  
- Transform data structures freely **only where behaviorally safe** (e.g., switch lists for arrays, stacks for queues, hash maps for dictionaries) ensuring no semantic or complexity changes  
- Restructure control flow extensively by:
  - Replacing loops with other loop types or equivalent recursion  
  - Swapping conditional constructs among if, if-else, switch/case, and ternary expressions   
  - Altering statement/block order and nesting as long as correctness is unaffected  
  - Splitting, merging, or flattening code blocks or functions internally, without changing external scopes or APIs  
- Reformulate expressions using algebraic, logical, or bitwise equivalences (e.g., replace `a + b` with `b + a`, use De Morgan’s laws, rewrite boolean expressions logically equivalent)  
- Avoid any comments, explanations, or extraneous text — output only the rewritten pseudocode  
- Output clean, consistently styled pseudocode in your own favored style, ensuring valid syntax  
- Respect the full original class/object hierarchy and do not alter or remove any declared classes, methods, or their signatures  
- Do **not** introduce new functions, remove existing ones, rename functions, or modify function parameters  
- Do not alter input/output behavior, method of receiving or returning data, or computational complexity beyond the original code  
- Do not use any constructs or optimizations that change algorithmic logic or difficult-to-verify behavioral nuances (e.g. probabilistic or lazy evaluation)

Your final output must be *only* the rewritten pseudocode, preserving all functionality with maximal lexical, structural, and idiomatic divergence from the input pseudocode, adhering strictly to the constraints above.
