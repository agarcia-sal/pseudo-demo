Given an input pseudocode snippet implementing one or more classes and functions, generate a transformed version of the pseudocode which is functionally identical and fully preserves all semantics, outputs, side effects, function/class names, signatures, and class hierarchies, but differs maximally in all other respects. Your rewrite must adhere strictly to these rules:

1. **Preserve exactly** all class names, function names, function signatures (parameter names, order, and types), and the class/object hierarchy as in the input. There must be no addition, removal, or renaming of any classes or functions.

2. **Maintain 100% semantic equivalence:** the transformed code must implement the exact same logic, produce exactly the same outputs, and handle all edge cases identically. All side effects, return values, and computational complexity must remain unchanged.

3. **Achieve maximal lexical and structural difference** by applying all of the following transformations wherever possible and valid:

   - Rename *all* local variables and temporary identifiers to fresh, unrelated names.

   - Substitute data structures with equivalent alternatives when applicable (e.g., swap arrays for lists, maps for dictionaries, stacks for queues) provided the semantics and performance remain identical.

   - Reconstruct control flow extensively by interchanging among `for`, `while`, `do-while`, recursive calls, and `switch`-like constructs (using nested conditional chains, for example), without changing behavior.

   - Rewrite conditional expressions using alternative logical or arithmetic operations (e.g., replace `if (a == b)` with `if not(a != b)`, use ternary expressions or explicit if-else blocks interchangeably).

   - Reorder independent statements, split or merge code blocks or loops where correctness allows, and refactor sequences of expressions into equivalent alternative formulations.

   - Replace arithmetic and logical expressions with equivalent expressions (e.g., use `x + (-y)` instead of `x - y`, or `!(a && b)` with `!a || !b`).

   - Re-express indexing and slicing via alternate indexing schemes or loops.

4. **Produce clean, syntactically valid pseudocode** consistent with your own stylistic choices (e.g., indentation, naming), but **do not** include any comments, explanations, annotations, or anything other than the rewritten pseudocode itself.

5. The output must be strictly pseudocode; no natural language or additional descriptions are allowed.

6. When ambiguity exists in valid transformations, prefer those which most increase dissimilarity from the original code while respecting the above constraints.

7. You may assume that the input pseudocode is syntactically correct and well-formed.

**Output format:** Only output the transformed pseudocode. Do not add any text before or after it.

---

**Important:** Preserve all class names, function names, and their signatures *exactly* as given, including parameter names and order, *without any modification or omission*.  
The resulting pseudocode must be semantically equivalent and utilize different naming, data structures, and control flow constructs to maximize divergence from the original.
