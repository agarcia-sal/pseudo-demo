Given input pseudocode, generate a logically equivalent pseudocode transformation that preserves every functional detail—including all behavior, outputs, edge cases, side effects, function signatures, and class hierarchies—while maximizing lexical, structural, and stylistic divergence from the original. Your rewritten pseudocode must:

- Retain all original class names, function names, and their exact signatures and nesting without any additions, removals, or renamings.
- Preserve original input/output behavior and algorithmic complexity exactly.
- Consistently change all variable names to new, unrelated identifiers.
- Systematically transform data structure types where possible (e.g., swap arrays, lists, stacks, queues, maps and sets interchangeably, provided functional equivalence is maintained).
- Rewrite all control flows by extensively varying between loops (for, while, recursion), conditionals (if-else, switch-case, ternary operators), and statement restructuring (splitting/merging/reordering blocks) without affecting semantics.
- Reformulate expressions using alternative but equivalent arithmetic, logical, and boolean constructs.
- Use different coding idioms and control abstractions if they do not alter correctness or outcome.
- Avoid any comments, explanations, or extra output; only output the rewritten pseudocode.
- Produce clean, fully valid pseudocode in a consistent style of your own choice, clearly distinct from the input style.

Strict prohibitions:

- Do not modify or reorder the class/object hierarchy or function signatures.
- Do not add or remove functions or classes.
- Do not alter function names or class names.
- Do not introduce new behavior or change computational complexity.
- Do not not output anything beyond the rewritten pseudocode.

Output ONLY the transformed pseudocode that is semantically identical but lexically and structurally maximally distinct from the input.

Remember: preserve all functional equivalences perfectly, but rewrite everything else aggressively to produce a new, highly distinct pseudocode version.
