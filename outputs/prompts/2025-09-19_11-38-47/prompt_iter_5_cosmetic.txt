Given the pseudocode below, rewrite it into a fully equivalent version that preserves all functionality, logic, control flow, and edge case handling exactly as in the original, while maximizing syntactic, lexical, structural, and idiomatic differences. Keep all original class names, function names, and their signatures intact, and maintain the original class and object hierarchy without any alteration. The output must be strictly pseudocode without any added commentary, explanation, or formatting beyond the code itself.

To achieve maximal diversity:  
- Rename all local variables and loop indices consistently but differently from the originals; however, do not rename function or class names.  
- Replace all loops with different kinds of loops (e.g., convert FOR loops to WHILE, WHILE to FOR, use recursion where applicable).  
- Transform conditionals to use alternative logical forms, e.g., invert conditions and adjust branches accordingly, or replace IF-ELSE with SWITCH or nested conditions.  
- Reorganize control flow: reorder independent statements, inline simple expressions or extract them as intermediate variables as suits increased difference but with full correctness.  
- Use alternative arithmetic and boolean expressions (e.g., replace `a + 1` with `1 + a`, or `NOT (a == b)` for `a != b`) as long as semantic equivalence is guaranteed.  
- Express data structures using different conceptual descriptions (e.g., use “dictionary with default empty list” phrasing instead of “map”, or describe arrays dynamically rather than statically if possible).  
- Avoid adding, removing, or renaming functions besides the strictly local variables or parameters; do not add helper functions or change function signatures.  
- Preserve exact return values, outputs, and side effects.  
- The final output should be concise pseudocode only, formatted similarly to the original but distinctly different in wording and style.

Your output must be solely this rewritten pseudocode and nothing else.
