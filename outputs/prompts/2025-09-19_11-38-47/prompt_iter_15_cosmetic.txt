Given input pseudocode, produce a logically equivalent pseudocode version that preserves all original class names, function names, signatures, and class/object hierarchies exactly, with identical behavior, outputs, return values, and side effects, but that differs as much as possible in all lexical and structural aspects.

Your rewrite must:

- Keep class and function names and their signatures unchanged, maintaining all input/output and hierarchical structures exactly  
- Retain the exact computation, logic, and output semantics across all cases, including edge scenarios  
- Maximize differences by thoroughly renaming all variables (avoid original names), consistently changing data structures and container types within valid equivalence (e.g., transform arrays into linked lists, stacks, or queues where semantics permit; replace maps with nested structures or equivalent lookups)  
- Aggressively diversify control flow: replace loops with recursion and vice versa, use alternative looping constructs (for, while, do-while, recursion), deploy different conditional forms (if-else, nested ifs, switch/case, ternary operators), reorder independent statements or merge/split blocks to disrupt original flow without changing meaning  
- Reformulate expressions extensively, such as rewriting arithmetic and boolean logic using equivalent but different forms, change operator styles, exploit algebraic identities, and rewrite truth conditions with De Morgan’s laws or alternative logical equivalents  
- Restructure code blocks by splitting, merging, reordering, or abstracting portions without altering correctness or outputs  
- Strictly omit all comments, explanations, print statements, or any extra text—output only the transformed pseudocode  
- Use a consistent, clean, well-formed pseudocode style of your own choosing, but do not replicate the input style  
- Avoid introducing any additional functions, classes, or altering function names or signatures  
- Do not add, remove, or change functionality or algorithmic complexity, nor alter input/output behavior beyond formatting and renaming  
- Ensure all renamed identifiers and data structures maintain consistent usage throughout the rewritten pseudocode  

Your final output must be solely the fully rewritten pseudocode text meeting all above requirements, maximizing lexical and structural divergence from the input while preserving perfect functional equivalence.
