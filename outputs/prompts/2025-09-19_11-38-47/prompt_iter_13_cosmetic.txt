Given the input pseudocode, produce a rewritten version that is fully equivalent in all functionality, corner cases, and outputs, but maximally distinct in every superficial and structural detail. Your rewrite must:

- Preserve all original class and function names exactly, along with their class/object hierarchies and function signatures  
- Implement the same logic and behaviors with identical side effects and return values  
- Severely diversify variable names, data structures (e.g., use arrays, lists, maps, stacks, queues interchangeably where valid), expressions, and operators  
- Vary control flow extensively by substituting among loops (for, while, recursion), conditionals (if-else, switch-case, ternary expressions), and restructuring statement order where semantics allow  
- Apply alternative expression formulations (e.g., use different arithmetic or boolean logic constructs equivalently)  
- Rearrange, split, or merge code blocks when it does not affect correctness or output  
- Eschew comments, explanations, or any output other than the rewritten pseudocode itself  
- Output clean, syntactically valid pseudocode using a consistent style of your own choosing

Do not:

- Change any class or function names  
- Add, remove, or rename functions  
- Alter function signatures or class hierarchy  
- Introduce any additional constructs that modify input/output behavior or computational complexity beyond the original logic  

Your output must be strictly pseudocode, containing only the transformed code that is logically identical but lexically and structurally maximally different from the input.
