Given the following pseudocode, rewrite it to produce a version that differs as much as possible in structure, style, and expression while preserving all original functionality. Maintain the exact same function names and class names, and ensure that the class and object hierarchies remain unchanged. Your output should contain only the revised pseudocode without any explanations or additional text.
