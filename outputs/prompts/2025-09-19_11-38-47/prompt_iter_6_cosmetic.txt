Given the pseudocode below, rewrite it as a functionally identical pseudocode that maintains all original class names, function names, and the class hierarchy exactly as in the input. Your output must consist solely of this rewritten pseudocode, without any additional text, comments, explanations, or markup.

Transform the code to maximize its syntactic and structural divergence by extensively varying:

- Control flow constructs (e.g., convert between `for`, `while`, recursion, conditional expressions),
- Variable and temporary identifier names (except class and function names, which must remain unchanged),
- Data structures and their usage styles,
- Expression order and style (including inlining or decomposing expressions),
- Statement ordering, where semantics allow reordering without changing behavior,
- Logical constructs (e.g., switch to equivalent boolean algebra, nested conditionals to flat ones, etc.),
- Looping styles and iteration methods (index-based, element-based, enumerators, recursion, etc.),
- Method of state updates and accumulations.

Do not add, remove, or alter any functions or their signatures, nor alter the input/output interface.

Preserve all edge case handling and exact return values.

Your rewritten pseudocode should reflect a thorough structural and lexical overhaul to the greatest extent possible while producing an output identical in behavior to the input.

Output only the transformed pseudocode as your answer, nothing else.
