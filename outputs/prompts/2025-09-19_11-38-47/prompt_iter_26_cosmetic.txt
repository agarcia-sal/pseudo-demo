Given an input pseudocode, your task is to produce a transformed version of this pseudocode that meets the following criteria:

1. **Exact Functional Equivalence**: The rewritten pseudocode must preserve all original behaviors, outputs, edge case handling, side effects, and computational complexity without any addition or removal of functionality.

2. **Unaltered Signature and Hierarchy**: Keep all original class names, function names, method signatures, and their placement within class/object hierarchies unchanged.

3. **Maximal Lexical and Structural Diversity**:  
   - Rename all local variables and internal identifiers aggressively, using semantically distinct names.  
   - Replace data structures with alternate but functionally equivalent choices where possible (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ queues ↔ stacks ↔ maps), provided logical integrity is maintained.  
   - Radically rearrange control flow constructs by converting between loops (for, while, recursion), conditionals (if-else, ternary, switch-case), and reorganize code blocks including splitting, merging, or reordering statements, wherever semantics allow.  
   - Reformulate expressions using equivalent mathematical, logical, or boolean identities and transformations (e.g., rewrite `a + b` as `b + a`, use De Morgan’s laws, replace increment/decrement by explicit addition/subtraction).  
   - Vary iteration methods: use indexed loops, iterators, recursion, or functional-style traversal interchangeably as valid.

4. **No Commentary or Explanations**: Output only the transformed pseudocode, ensuring it is clean, syntactically valid, and consistently styled in your own clear pseudocode dialect.

5. **Strict Constraints**:  
   - Do not change or remove any class or function definitions, nor add new ones.  
   - Do not modify function parameter lists or return types.  
   - Do not introduce any new global or external state, or alter computational complexity or runtime behavior.  
   - Do not insert debug output, comments, or annotations.

6. **Output Format**:  
   - Provide only the complete pseudocode with no additional preamble, postamble, or explanation.  
   - Maintain the original class and function hierarchy and their exact names to ensure codebase consistency.

Your solution will be evaluated based on passing functional correctness tests and maximizing dissimilarity from the input pseudocode at lexical and structural levels while obeying the above rules. Prioritize sophisticated control flow transformation and data structure substitution techniques, combined with aggressive renaming and expression reworking, to maximize distinctness without impairing behavior.
