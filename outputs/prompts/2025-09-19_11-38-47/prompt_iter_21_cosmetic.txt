Given pseudocode input, produce a rewritten version that is functionally identical in all respects—including handling of corner cases, output values, side effects, and computational complexity—but intentionally differs as much as possible from the original in all lexical, syntactic, and structural facets. Your rewrite must adhere to the following constraints:

- **Class and function names, including their containment hierarchy and signatures, must be kept exactly as in the original pseudocode.** Do not add, remove, or rename any classes or functions.

- **Preserve all program logic, behaviors, and semantics perfectly:** The rewritten pseudocode must produce identical results on all valid inputs.

- **Maximally diversify every other element:** Change all variable names completely with no semantic overlap; replace data structures where logically equivalent alternatives exist (e.g., stack ⇄ queue ⇄ list ⇄ map), making sure behavior remains unchanged.

- **Transform control flow extensively:**  
  - Replace loops with different loop types or recursion where possible.  
  - Transform if-else chains to switch or ternary expressions when valid.  
  - Reorder, merge, or split code blocks freely as long as functional correctness is unaffected.  
  - Introduce short-circuit logic or other equivalent constructs that alter flow without changing outcomes.

- **Rewrite expressions in alternative semantically equivalent forms:**  
  - Use different arithmetic, boolean, and logical operators with the same effect.  
  - Substitute equivalent expressions (e.g., `x * 2` → `x << 1`, or `!(a && b)` → `!a || !b`) where valid.

- **Avoid any comments or extraneous explanation**—output exactly one block of clean, syntactically correct pseudocode, formatted consistently in any clear style you choose.

- **Do not change the input/output interface, complexity class, or any side effects.** Do not add new functions, change parameters or signatures, or alter the order of function definitions inside classes.

- **Maintain or improve readability within your style, but prioritize maximum lexical and structural difference from the input.** The goal is to produce a logically equivalent yet lexically and structurally distinct pseudocode variant.

Your final output must be only this rewritten pseudocode, preserving all class and function names and structures unchanged but otherwise transformed as radically as possible while maintaining perfect functional equivalence.
