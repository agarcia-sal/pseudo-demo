Given the original pseudocode as input, generate a transformed pseudocode version that preserves *all* original functionality, edge cases, input/output behavior, and exact function signatures, but differs maximally in every lexical and structural detail. Your output should:

- Retain **all class and function names exactly**, including their complete hierarchy, object relationships, and signatures without any modification, addition, or deletion.
- Implement the *same* algorithm and produce *identical* results, including side effects, return values, and performance characteristics.
- Aggressively diversify:
  - Variable, parameter, and local identifiers (use new, unrelated names).
  - Data structures used for equivalent purposes (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ maps ↔ stacks ↔ queues, wherever semantics allow).
  - Control structure paradigms by intermixing or replacing `for` loops, `while` loops, recursion, and iterator-based traversals.
  - Conditional forms and logic: transform `if-else` into `switch-case` or ternaries; rewrite boolean expressions with logically equivalent alternatives (De Morgan’s laws, double negations, alternate arithmetic forms).
  - Code organization: reorder, split, merge, encapsulate or inline blocks without changing semantics, respecting scoping rules.
  - Expressions and statements: rewrite arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators with alternative but equivalent constructs.
- Avoid:
  - Changing or renaming classes or functions themselves.
  - Adding or removing functions or methods.
  - Altering function signatures, visibility, arguments, or return types.
  - Introducing extraneous functionality or changing time/space complexity.
  - Producing comments, explanations, or any output other than the rewritten pseudocode.
- Output only *clean*, syntactically correct pseudocode adhering to a consistent style of your choice.

**Additional explicit instructions to maximize correctness and variation while minimizing errors:**

- Ensure all container initializations match the chosen data types after transformation (e.g., if replacing stacks with queues, preserve correct push/pop or enqueue/dequeue semantics).
- Carefully preserve iteration bounds and termination conditions with equivalent but varied idioms.
- For recursion, implement tail calls or memoization where applicable, or convert loops to recursion and vice versa as long as correctness is guaranteed.
- Use varied indexing and slicing styles—zero-based, one-based, offsets, or pointer-style indexing consistently.
- Employ multiple syntactic rearrangements and restructuring passes in your transformation to maximize lexical and structural divergence.
- Guarantee the final output is strictly pseudocode without any extraneous content or syntax errors.

**In summary, produce a transformed pseudocode version that is:**

- *Functionally identical* and *semantically equivalent*,
- *Class and function names unchanged*,
- *Lexically and structurally maximally different*,
- *Free from comments or explanation*,
- *Valid pseudocode with consistent style*,
- *Only the rewritten pseudocode as output.*
