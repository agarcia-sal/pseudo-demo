Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a fully functionally equivalent pseudocode version that adheres strictly to the original API: keep all class names, function names, function signatures, and inheritance hierarchies exactly as in the input. Your output pseudocode must produce identical outputs, cover all edge cases, and preserve all side effects without any deviation from the original logic or complexity.

Your rewritten pseudocode must satisfy the following criteria *simultaneously*:

- **Lexical variation:** rename all local variables, parameters, and temporary identifiers to semantically neutral but distinct names from the original. Do not change class or function identifiers.
- **Data structure substitution:** where possible, replace data structures (e.g., arrays, lists, stacks, queues, maps, sets) with alternative valid structures that do not alter algorithmic behavior or output.
- **Control flow transformation:** extensively refactor loops (for, while, recursion), conditionals (if-else, switch-case, ternary), and logical constructs while preserving execution semantics. Rearrange, merge or split code blocks freely so long as correctness remains intact.
- **Expression and operation rewrites:** reformulate arithmetic, logical, and boolean expressions using equivalent alternative constructs (e.g., change `a + b` into `b + a`, use De Morgan’s laws, replace explicit increments with equivalent assignments).
- **Structural reorganization:** reorder independent statements when safe to do so, inline or extract helper logic within functions without changing function signatures or external behavior.
- **Style and formatting:** output clean, syntactically valid pseudocode styled consistently but distinct from the input style. Avoid copying indentation, spacing, or comment style.

Do **not**:

- Rename, add, remove, or reorder any classes or functions in the class hierarchy.
- Modify class definitions, function signatures, return types, or their parameter lists.
- Alter the overall algorithmic complexity or introduce behaviors changing input-output semantics.
- Add comments, explanatory text, or output anything other than the rewritten pseudocode.
- Use any external libraries or language-specific constructs not implied or present in the original pseudocode.

**Your final output must only be the transformed, standalone pseudocode — no commentary, explanation, markdown formatting, or additional text.**
