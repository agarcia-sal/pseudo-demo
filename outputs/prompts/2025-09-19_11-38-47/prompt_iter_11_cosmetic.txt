Given the original pseudocode, rewrite it into a new version that maintains exact functionality, behaviors, all edge cases, outputs, and logic correctness, but differs maximally in every superficial way possible. Preserve all original class and function names and their exact signatures without any additions, removals, or structural modifications to the class or object hierarchy. Your transformation must only affect the internal implementation, altering syntax, control flow style (including by swapping among loops, recursion, and conditional constructs), code structure, order of independent statements, variable naming (except for classes/functions), data representations, and expression formulation—wherever code semantics allow—to yield high lexical, syntactic, and structural divergence from the original. Do not add or remove helper functions; inline or rework code only inside existing functions. Completely exclude any explanatory text, comments, or extra output; provide only the rewritten pseudocode. Optimize for the widest possible variation from the input pseudocode without compromising on function fidelity or correctness. The output must be a concise, clean pseudocode snippet retaining all original functional outcomes with class and function names untouched and hierarchy preserved.
