Given any input pseudocode, rewrite it into a functionally identical yet lexically and structurally maximally divergent version. Your transformed pseudocode must adhere to the following constraints:

- **Preserve all class names, function names, their exact signatures, and class/object hierarchies without any additions, removals, or renamings.**
- **Produce code with the same behavior, logic, output, and side effects in every edge case.**
- **Radically rename all local variables, parameters, and internal identifiers with consistent but unrelated names, ensuring no clashes or shadowing.**
- **Extensively vary the control flow by replacing loops with recursion or vice versa, swapping among `for`, `while`, and recursion, and using different conditional structures—including nested if-elses, switch-cases, and ternary-like expressions where applicable.**
- **Interchange equivalent data structures where possible (e.g., lists ⇄ arrays ⇄ stacks ⇄ queues ⇄ maps), reorganizing code to use alternative valid abstractions without changing the core algorithmic complexity or semantics.**
- **Rearrange, split, or combine code blocks logically to produce different structural grouping, provided correctness and output do not change.**
- **Rewrite all expressions and operations using alternative but logically equivalent forms (e.g., `a + b` → `b + a`, `!(a && b)` → `!a || !b`, `x / y` → `x * (1/y)` if valid in pseudocode, or other algebraic/logical transformations).**
- **Avoid any comments, explanatory text, or annotations; the output must be strictly clean pseudocode only.**
- **Use a uniform, consistent pseudocode style of your own choosing, different from the input’s style, but clearly readable and syntactically correct.**

Do not:

- Alter or omit class or function declarations or hierarchies.
- Add or remove any functions or methods.
- Change function parameter lists or return types.
- Introduce calls to external functions or libraries not present in the input.
- Modify any input/output behavior or computational complexity beyond logically equivalent rewrites.

**Output only the rewritten pseudocode respecting all above rules and constraints.**
