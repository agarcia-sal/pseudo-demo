Given the pseudocode below, generate a functionally identical pseudocode version that differs as much as possible from the original in all surface aspects—syntax, control flow constructs, variable names, statement order (where semantics allow), expression formats, and data representations—while strictly preserving complete logic, behavior, edge cases, and return values. You must keep all original class and function names intact, as well as the original class and object hierarchy without any modifications. Do not alter function signatures or introduce new functions. Avoid any explanatory text, comments, or output other than the rewritten pseudocode itself. Strive for maximal lexical and structural diversity by freely substituting loops (for, while, recursion), conditionals (if-else, switch, ternary), data structures, and expression styles, and by reorganizing code blocks where they do not affect execution correctness. Your output should be clean, concise, and contain only the transformed pseudocode preserving all original functional outcomes.
