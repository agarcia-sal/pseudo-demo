Given the original pseudocode input, rewrite the entire code to produce a functionally identical pseudocode version that passes all tests with exactly the same outputs, edge case handling, and side effects, but is transformed as drastically as possible in every lexical, structural, and stylistic aspect—maximizing difference from the original. 

Your rewrite must adhere strictly to these rules:

1. **Preserve all class names, function names, function signatures, and the exact class/object hierarchy/structure with no changes.**  
2. **Functionality and behavior including all inputs, outputs, return values, and side effects must remain perfectly identical. No logic or semantic changes are allowed.**  
3. **Thoroughly rename all non-function/class identifiers (variables, parameters, temporaries, constants) to completely different names with no reuse from original identifiers.**  
4. **Transform all data structures to valid alternatives wherever possible without changing semantics (use arrays, lists, maps/dictionaries, stacks, queues interchangeably if valid for the situation).**  
5. **Rewrite all control flow constructs aggressively: replace for-loops with while-loops or recursion, invert conditionals, use switch-case or ternary operators where suitable, reorder independent statements, split or merge blocks, etc.**  
6. **Rewrite all expressions and operators into alternative but logically equivalent forms: use different arithmetical transformations, boolean algebra equivalences, different comparison styles, alternate indexing, and so forth.**  
7. **Do not add any comments, print statements, or explanations—output only the transformed pseudocode.**  
8. **Use a clean, consistent, well-structured pseudocode style of your choice that differs from the input style (e.g., different indentation, keyword casing, or statement format), but maintain readability and syntactic validity for pseudocode.**  
9. **Do not add, remove, rename, or reorder any functions or class declarations. Do not modify function signatures or class hierarchies.**  
10. **Do not introduce new helper constructs or modules outside what is strictly necessary to preserve exact behavior.**  
11. **Do not change input/output specification (no changes to input parameters or returned results).**  
12. **Maximize lexical, syntactic, and structural divergence from the input pseudocode while preserving semantics perfectly.**

**Final output should be ONLY the transformed pseudocode code fulfilling the above criteria, without any further text or explanation.**
