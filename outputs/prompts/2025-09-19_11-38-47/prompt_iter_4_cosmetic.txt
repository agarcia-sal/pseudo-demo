Given the pseudocode below, produce a fully equivalent pseudocode rewrite that differs as extensively as possible from the original in syntax, control structures, variable names, flow, and style, while strictly preserving all logic and semantics. Retain all original class and function names exactly, and preserve the entire class and object hierarchy without any alteration. Do not add any comments, explanations, or extraneous textâ€”your output must be solely the rewritten pseudocode. Achieve maximal structural and lexical diversity by employing varied loop constructs, conditional forms, data representations, and expression styles. Feel free to reorder independent statements or decompose/inline logic as long as functionality is identical and all original behaviors, edge cases, and return values are faithfully maintained. Avoid introducing new functions or changing function signatures. Your response must be concise and only contain the transformed pseudocode.
