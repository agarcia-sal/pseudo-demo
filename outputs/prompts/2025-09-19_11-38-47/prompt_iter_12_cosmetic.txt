Given the pseudocode below, produce a fully functionally equivalent pseudocode version that differs from the original as radically as possible on all surface dimensions—this includes but is not limited to: variable and parameter renaming, reordering of independent statements and code blocks, substituting control flow constructs (e.g., replacing loops with recursion or different loop types), altering expression and data representation styles, restructuring conditionals (including usage of if-else, switch, ternary, or pattern-matching styles), and using alternative data structures where safe to do so. You must preserve the original class names precisely and maintain all class and object hierarchies unchanged. Similarly, all function names and their signatures must remain exactly as given, with no new functions added or existing ones removed or renamed. The logic, behavior, edge case handling, and output must remain strictly identical in semantics and results. Your output should contain only the rewritten pseudocode—no comments, explanations, notes, or extraneous text. Aim to maximize lexical, syntactic, and structural divergence while guaranteeing consistent and correct execution results. The output pseudocode should be concise, clear, and directly runnable as a conceptual blueprint matching the original functionality exactly.
