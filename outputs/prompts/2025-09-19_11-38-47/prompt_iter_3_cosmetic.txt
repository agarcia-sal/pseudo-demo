Given the input pseudocode, produce a rewritten pseudocode version that is functionally identical but exhibits maximal divergence in the following aspects: syntax, variable and parameter names, control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion), data structures used, expression formulations, and overall structural organization. Rigidly preserve all original function names, class names, and maintain the exact class and object hierarchy without any renaming or restructuring. Avoid adding any comments, explanations, or extraneous text—output only the transformed pseudocode. Strive for comprehensive stylistic, idiomatic, and structural variation, such as inverting conditions, replacing loop types (e.g., replacing WHILE loops with FOR loops or recursion), altering expression evaluation order, using alternative constructs or algorithmic equivalents, renaming all local variables and parameters thoroughly, and reordering logically independent statements wherever possible, **while guaranteeing that the final pseudocode’s runtime behavior and output remain perfectly equivalent to the original.** The entire response must consist solely of this rewritten pseudocode.
