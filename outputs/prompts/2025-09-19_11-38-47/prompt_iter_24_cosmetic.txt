Given the input pseudocode, generate a rewritten version that is functionally identical in every respect—producing the same outputs for all inputs, handling all edge cases identically, and preserving all side effects—while making it as lexically, syntactically, and structurally distinct from the original as possible. Your rewriting must adhere strictly to the following constraints:

1. **Class and Function Identity Constraints**  
   - Keep all class names unchanged and maintain their original class/object hierarchies exactly.  
   - Keep function names and their signatures unchanged without adding, removing, or renaming any functions.  
   - Preserve exact function signatures, including parameter names and types where specified.  

2. **Functional Equivalence**  
   - The rewritten pseudocode must implement precisely the same core logic and produce identical results for every input, including correctly handling all corner cases.  
   - Do not introduce any functional changes, additional side effects, or alter the original computational complexity or I/O behavior.  

3. **Maximum Lexical and Structural Variation**  
   - Rename all local variables, loop counters, and temporary identifiers to completely different names from the original (stick to consistent, valid pseudocode naming conventions).  
   - Replace each data structure from the original code with a semantically compatible alternative, wherever possible (e.g., swap arrays for lists, maps for dictionaries, stacks for queues, sets for lists, or vice versa), *but only if this preserves correctness exactly*.  
   - Change all control flow constructs extensively: transform loops (for ↔ while ↔ recursion), expand or contract conditional branches (if-else ↔ switch-case ↔ ternary expressions), reorder statements legally, and restructure code blocks defensibly.  
   - Rewrite expressions and operations using mathematically or logically equivalent alternatives (e.g., use De Morgan’s laws, replace arithmetic operators with equivalent expressions, use different comparison operators, rearrange associative operations).  
   - Break down complex statements into simpler steps, merge multiple statements where valid, or reorder commands without changing semantics.  

4. **Style & Output Requirements**  
   - Use a consistent and clean pseudocode style of your choice, but avoid any comments, explanations, or output other than pure rewritten pseudocode code.  
   - Ensure the output is valid pseudocode and fully self-contained.  
   - Do not include any debug statements, metadata, or auxiliary text outside the pseudocode rewrite.  

Summary: Produce **only** the rewritten pseudocode as output, strictly preserving class and function names/signatures and functional behavior, while applying maximal renaming, alternate data structures, diverse control flow transformations, equivalent expression rewrites, and code restructurings to achieve maximal difference from the input.
