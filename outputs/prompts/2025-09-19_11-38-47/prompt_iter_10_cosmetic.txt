Given the pseudocode below, produce a rewritten version that precisely preserves **all** functional aspects—including logic, control flow semantics, edge case handling, and outputs—but differs maximally in all **surface-level** elements. Your transformation must maintain identical function names, class names, and the exact class/object hierarchy; you must not alter function signatures or add/remove any functions or classes.

Your rewritten pseudocode should exhibit radical diversity by:

- Renaming all local variables, parameters, and intermediate identifiers arbitrarily.
- Replacing every control flow construct freely (e.g., interchange for, while, recursion; substitute if-else chains with switches or ternaries; reorder independent statements or branches).
- Reformulating expressions syntactically (use alternative arithmetic/logical expressions, swap operator precedence styles, convert index-based access to iterator style if consistent).
- Transforming data structure usage within the given constraints (e.g., replace arrays with lists, stacks with queues, or maps with dictionaries where feasible).
- Restructuring loop bodies and internal sequencing where it does not affect the final behavior or output.

Do **not** include any comments, explanations, or extraneous text. Your output must be clean pseudocode only.

Remember:

- **Function and class names must remain exactly as in the original.**
- The original class/object structural hierarchy cannot be changed or flattened.
- Function signatures and interfaces remain untouched.
- No additional functions/methods or classes beyond the original scope may be added.
- Fully reproduce all logic and outputs exactly.
- Maximize syntactic, lexical, structural, and idiomatic variation to minimize similarity to the input pseudocode.

Output solely the fully transformed pseudocode. No extra formatting or notes.
