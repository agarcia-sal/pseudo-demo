Given an input pseudocode snippet, output a transformed version of that pseudocode that is strictly functionally equivalent—matching all behaviors, outputs, and edge cases exactly—but is syntactically, lexically, and structurally maximally distinct from the original. Your transformation must adhere to these rules and priorities:

- **Preserve all class names, function names, function signatures, and class/object hierarchies exactly.**  
- **Maintain all input/output behaviors, return values, side effects, and control flow semantics without any deviation.**  
- Severely vary all other elements, including but not limited to:  
  - Variable names, renaming all identifiers except functions, classes, and fixed signatures  
  - Data structures usage, substituting with alternative structures allowed by semantics (e.g., replace lists with queues, stacks, sets, maps, arrays, etc. where logically feasible)  
  - Control structures, applying diverse refactorings such as:  
    - Replacing loops with equivalent recursion and vice versa  
    - Switching if-else chains into switch-case or ternary conditionals  
    - Reordering or splitting/merging code blocks without changing meaning  
  - Expressions and operators, rewriting logic and arithmetic with equivalent alternatives (e.g., different boolean algebra forms, alternate arithmetic expressions, bitwise variations)  
  - Algorithmic step rearrangements or decompositions that do not alter computational complexity or external behavior  
- Exclude any comments, explanations, or outputs beyond the rewritten pseudocode itself.  
- Produce clean, syntactically valid pseudocode according to a consistent style of your own choosing.  

**Do not:**  
- Rename or remove any function or class definitions, or change their signatures or the class hierarchy  
- Modify or introduce any calls, operations, or constructs that change how inputs are processed or outputs produced  
- Alter the algorithmic complexity or fundamental algorithmic approach implicitly (e.g., don’t replace an O(n) solution with an O(n^2) one)  
- Add comments, metadata, or non-pseudocode content  

**Output only the transformed pseudocode.**  
Maintain the exact class and function names and structures as in the input, but otherwise vary everything maximally while guaranteeing perfect functional equivalence.
