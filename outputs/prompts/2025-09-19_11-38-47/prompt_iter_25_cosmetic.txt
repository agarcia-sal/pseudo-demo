Given input pseudocode, generate a functionally equivalent pseudocode version that preserves the original class names, function names, and signatures exactly—including class/object hierarchies—while maximizing lexical, structural, and stylistic differences. Your transformed pseudocode must:

- Retain original class and method names, argument lists, and their nested structure unchanged  
- Preserve full original behavior, logic, output, side effects, data flow, and corner case handling  
- Heavily vary variable names, data container types (e.g., replace arrays with linked lists, maps with sets where valid), and data access patterns  
- Reconstruct all control flow using diverse constructs: mutually replace loops (for, while, recursion), conditionals (if-else chains, switches, ternary expressions), and rearranged or split/merged code blocks without altering semantics  
- Reformulate expressions with equivalent alternatives using different arithmetic, boolean logic, or short-circuiting techniques  
- Reorder independent statements and restructure computations while maintaining correctness  
- Use alternate idiomatic pseudocode syntax and formatting styles distinct from the input but consistently applied  
- Exclude all comments, explanations, or additional output apart from the rewritten pseudocode itself

Strictly do NOT:

- Change class or function names, signatures, or class hierarchy  
- Add or remove any functions or classes  
- Modify input/output semantics, algorithmic complexity, or side effects in any way  
- Introduce constructs that the original pseudocode does not imply (e.g., concurrency, memoization, parallelism)  

Output ONLY the syntactically valid rewritten pseudocode, fully faithful in logic but lexically and structurally maximally transformed, preserving the original program’s interface, semantics, and behavior exactly. The output should be clean, human-readable pseudocode in a consistent style of your choice distinct from the input style.
