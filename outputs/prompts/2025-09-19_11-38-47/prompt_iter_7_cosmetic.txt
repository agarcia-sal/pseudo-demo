Given the pseudocode below, rewrite it into a fully functionally equivalent version that preserves all class and function names exactly, as well as the entire class and object hierarchy without any modifications. Your output must exclusively contain the rewritten pseudocode—no explanations, comments, or additional text. Maximize divergence from the original by employing as many of the following as possible: alternative control flow structures (e.g., replacing loops with recursion or different loop types), different variable names, reordered logically independent statements, varied data representations and expression styles, changed nesting levels, and different syntax patterns—while ensuring that every behavior, edge case, and return value remains identical and no new functions are introduced or existing signatures altered. Strictly maintain the original function names and class names with their exact spellings and placements. Your response should be concise and contain only the transformed pseudocode.
