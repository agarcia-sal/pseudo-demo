Given the input pseudocode, generate a rewritten version that is functionally identical—producing exactly the same outputs and preserving all behaviors, side effects, exception cases, and signatures—but syntactically, lexically, and structurally as different as possible from the original. Your rewritten pseudocode must adhere strictly to the following constraints:

- **Class and function names, their hierarchies, and all function signatures must remain exactly as in the input.** Do not add, remove, rename, or reorder these.

- **Logic and algorithmic behavior, including side effects, must be preserved perfectly.** The code must produce identical results on all inputs.

- **Transform variable names completely, using distinct, consistent renamings.** Avoid any original variable names except class and function identifiers.

- **Replace data structures with alternate, semantically equivalent types when valid** (e.g., switch lists for arrays or queues for stacks), preserving time and space complexity.

- **Rewrite control flow constructs extensively:**  
  - Replace loops with other types (for ↔ while ↔ recursion) where feasible  
  - Vary conditionals (if-else, switch/case, ternary operators)  
  - Reorder, split, or merge code blocks without changing semantics

- **Rewrite expressions using alternative but equivalent operators and formulations:**  
  - Use different arithmetic expressions, distributions, or boolean logic rewrites  
  - Inline or extract intermediate results as appropriate

- **Restructure code to use different idiomatic styles or syntactic forms,** including changes in assignment style, loop variables, indexing expressions, and whitespace formatting to maximize distinction.

- **Do not add comments, explanations, or any output other than the rewritten pseudocode itself.**

- **Output should be in clean, valid pseudocode styled consistently in your own chosen manner.**

- **Avoid any transformations that would affect computational complexity, input/output behavior, or correctness.** Performance characteristics must remain comparable.

Strictly ensure that the final output is *only* the transformed pseudocode—nothing else. The goal is to produce a logically identical but maximally different pseudocode version, with absolutely no change in interfaces, algorithms, or outputs.
