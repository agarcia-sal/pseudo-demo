Given the input pseudocode, rewrite it to produce a functionally identical version that matches the original's behavior and outputs perfectly, including all edge cases, but which is maximally different in style, structure, naming, and control flow. Your rewritten pseudocode must adhere to these strict requirements:

- Preserve all original class names exactly and maintain the same class and object hierarchy without any additions, removals, or rearrangements.  
- Keep all function names and their signatures (parameters, return types, modifiers) exactly as in the original, without adding, removing, or renaming any functions or parameters.  
- Retain the exact input/output behavior, algorithm logic, and side effects, ensuring output correctness and performance characteristics are unchanged.  
- Aggressively rename all local variables, parameters (except for those in function signatures), data structure names, and temporary identifiers with fresh, unrelated names.  
- Replace data structures freely with alternative, valid equivalents that do not alter semantics (e.g., replace stacks with queues or lists, maps with associative arrays, mutable arrays with linked lists), while preserving their usage pattern exactly.  
- Restructure all control flows extensively:
  - Substitute among all loop types (for, while, do-while, recursion) wherever semantics allow.  
  - Replace if-else chains with switch-case constructs, nested ternary expressions, or equivalent logical expressions.  
  - Split, merge, reorder, or nest statements and code blocks as long as behavior remains unchanged.  
- Use alternative but equivalent expressions for arithmetic, boolean logic, and comparisons (e.g., De Morgan’s laws, arithmetic identities, bitwise versus arithmetic operations where applicable).  
- Avoid retaining any comments, debugging statements, or explanatory text. Output only the rewritten pseudocode.  
- Output pseudocode that is clean and readable with a consistent style of your choice, but stylistically distinct from the input’s style (different indentation style, keyword casing, braces/indentation, statement terminators, etc.).  

Do NOT:  
- Change any class or function names or signatures, or add/remove classes or functions.  
- Alter input/output behavior or computational complexity.  
- Introduce constructs that do not exist in the original (e.g., adding concurrency, external calls, caching if absent).  
- Include any text other than the rewritten pseudocode itself; do not output explanations, summaries, or metadata.

The output must be strictly pseudocode preserving all logical correctness but be lexically and structurally maximally different from the input.

**Remember:** The rewritten code must pass all test cases identically to the original; differences are only in naming, structure, data organization, and expression formulation.
