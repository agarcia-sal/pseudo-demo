Given the pseudocode below, generate a rewritten version that is maximally distinct from the original in syntax, structure, variable naming, control flow, and expressionâ€”while strictly preserving all original semantics and logic. Preserve all original function names, class names, and the exact class and object hierarchy without modification. Avoid adding comments or explanations; output only the transformed pseudocode. Emphasize diverse programmatic constructs, alternative loop types, conditionals, data structure manipulations, and ordering to achieve maximal syntactic and stylistic divergence, but ensure the output remains fully equivalent in behavior to the input. Your entire response must be solely the rewritten pseudocode.
