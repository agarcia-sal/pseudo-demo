Given the input pseudocode, rewrite it into a logically identical pseudocode version that preserves **all functionality, behaviors, side effects, outputs, function signatures, class names, and inheritance hierarchies exactly as in the original**, but is **maximally different in all other respects**.

Your rewrite must:

- Keep all class names, function names, their signatures, and class/object relationships **unchanged**.
- Retain identical input/output behavior and cover all corner cases with no deviation.
- Radically alter all other details, including but not limited to:
  - Renaming variables consistently and thoroughly using distinct, unrelated names.
  - Replacing each data structure with an alternative valid structure whenever feasible (e.g., stacks ↔ queues, arrays ↔ lists ↔ maps).
  - Transforming all control flows: interchange `for`, `while`, `do-while` loops, replace iteration with recursion where possible, substitute `if-else` chains with `switch-case` or ternary-like constructs (where supported), and reorder or restructure code blocks without breaking logic.
  - Reformulating expressions using mathematically or logically equivalent but syntactically different constructs (e.g., using De Morgan’s laws, different arithmetic operations or boolean logic expressions).
  - Splitting, merging, or reorganizing code blocks and statements as long as program correctness and output remain exactly the same.
  - Avoiding comments, explanations, or any text other than pseudocode.
  - Selecting your own consistent, clean pseudocode style and syntax conventions distinct from the original.

You must **not**:

- Change or rename any classes or functions.
- Add or remove any functions or alter their signatures or inheritance structures.
- Introduce new input/output mechanisms or modify computational complexity beyond the original logic.
- Output anything other than the rewritten pseudocode itself (no summaries, notes, or metadata).

The output must be **strictly valid pseudocode**, fully self-contained, containing only the transformed code that behaves identically but is lexically and structurally maximally distinct from the input.

Emphasize creative and systematic divergence in naming, structure, data representations, and control flow, all while safeguarding *bitwise* functional equivalence.

Output only the final pseudocode rewriting — no additional text.
