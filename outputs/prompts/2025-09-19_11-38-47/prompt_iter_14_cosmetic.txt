Given the input pseudocode, generate a semantically identical but lexically and structurally maximally divergent pseudocode version according to these explicit directives:

- **Preserve exactly** all class names, function names, and their complete class/object hierarchies as well as all function signatures, including parameters and return types.
- Implement **identical logic, side effects, return values, and behavior for all inputs and edge cases** with zero functional deviation.
- **Strongly diversify naming:** rename all local variables, parameters (except function signature parameters), and internal identifiers to new, unrelated names.
- **Vary data structures** freely but only when behavior remains identical (e.g., swap arrays, lists, stacks, queues, maps, sets where interchangeable).
- **Thoroughly restructure control flow:** substitute loops (for, while, recursion), conditionals (if-else, switch-case, ternary expressions), and reorder, split, or merge code blocks without affecting observable correctness.
- **Reformulate expressions:** use equivalent but syntactically different arithmetic, logical, and boolean expressions (e.g., replace `a + b` with `b + a`, use De Morgan’s laws, change loop increments/decrements, etc.).
- **Change code formatting and ordering** as much as possible while preserving semantics (e.g., replace explicit index-based loops with iterator-based loops, unroll or roll loops, invert conditions).
- **Do not introduce any new functions or classes,** do not remove or rename existing ones, and do not modify function signatures or class inheritance.
- **Maintain the original input/output interface exactly,** including argument order and return statements.
- **Do not add, remove, or reorder comments** – in fact, completely omit comments and any non-code output.
- **Output only syntactically valid pseudocode** in a consistent, clean style of your own choosing, with no explanation or additional text.
- You must ensure that the rewritten pseudocode is robust: it should pass strict equivalence tests on all inputs identical to the original pseudocode’s behavior.

**Important:**

- Your output must contain solely the rewritten pseudocode—nothing else.
- Class and function declarations and signatures remain fixed and recognizable.
- Any auxiliary or internal identifiers (variables, temporaries, loop counters, internal data structure names) must be replaced by fresh, unrelated identifiers.
- Control flow and data structure transformations must not alter algorithmic complexity or input/output characteristics.
- Avoid trivial renaming alone; aggressively diversify all code aspects while preserving semantics.
- Do not add, remove, or reorder function/class definitions.
- Comments or explanations are disallowed in the output.

Produce your output accordingly.
