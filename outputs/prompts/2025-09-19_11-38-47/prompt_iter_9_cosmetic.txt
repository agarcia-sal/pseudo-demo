Given the pseudocode below, generate a functionally equivalent pseudocode that differs maximally from the original in style, structure, and syntax, while strictly preserving all behavior, logic, edge cases, output values, and return types. Your transformed version must:

- Retain all original class names, function names, signatures, class hierarchies, and object structures exactly as given.
- Not introduce new functions or modify existing function signatures.
- Avoid any explanatory comments, text, or output beyond the rewritten pseudocode itself.
- Apply comprehensive lexical, structural, and syntactic diversity, including but not limited to:
  - Renaming all local variables and parameters arbitrarily.
  - Replacing one control flow construct with others (e.g., for ↔ while ↔ recursion, if-else ↔ switch/case ↔ ternary expressions).
  - Reordering independent statements and blocks where it does not affect correctness.
  - Using alternative data representations, expressions, and idioms.
  - Transforming loops into recursive calls or vice versa.
  - Varying conditional guard styles and rearranging branches logically.
- Eliminate superficial resemblance by diversifying code layout, expression grouping, and iteration/control constructs, while keeping semantics intact.
- Ensure the output is syntactically clean, concise, and self-contained pseudocode containing only the transformed code.

Output exclusively the rewritten pseudocode preserving exact functional equivalence and API contract, aiming for maximal structural and lexical divergence from the input.
