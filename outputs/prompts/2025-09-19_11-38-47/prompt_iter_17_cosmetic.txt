Given an input pseudocode, generate a fully equivalent version that preserves **all original function names, class names, signatures, and class/object hierarchies exactly**, while ensuring the output pseudocode is **maximally different** in all other aspects including:

- Variable names replaced comprehensively with different, consistent alternatives  
- Data structures substituted with alternative valid types wherever applicable (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ stacks ↔ queues ↔ maps), choosing semantically valid replacements  
- Control flow aggressively transformed by interchanging loops (for, while, recursion), branching statements (if-else, switch-case, ternary), and by splitting, merging, or reordering independent statements while maintaining semantic equivalence  
- Expressions restructured using alternative but logically identical formulations, including arithmetic identities, boolean logic reformulations, and different ordering of operations when safe  
- Code blocks reorganized by grouping, ungrouping, or flattening nested constructs if semantics allow  
- Removal of all comments, explanations, or anything besides executable pseudocode  
- Syntax polished to a consistent, clean pseudocode style of your own design (you may deviate from input formatting)  
- Preservation of all side effects, outputs, and computational complexity exactly as in the original  

**Do NOT:**

- Modify any function or class names, their signatures, or class/object hierarchies  
- Add or remove functions, methods, or classes  
- Change any input/output behaviors or add new constructs that would alter runtime complexity or functionality  
- Output anything other than the transformed pseudocode  

Your output must be purely pseudocode representing a logically identical implementation but structurally and lexically maximally distinct from the original.

**Important:**  
- Keep original function and class names unchanged, exactly as in input  
- Keep class and object hierarchies unchanged  
- Only replace internal implementation details  

Output only the complete rewritten pseudocode — no explanations, no commentary, no extra text beyond the valid pseudocode.
