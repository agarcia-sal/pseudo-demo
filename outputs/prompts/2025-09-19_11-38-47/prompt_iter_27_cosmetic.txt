Given an input pseudocode snippet, rewrite it to produce a functionally identical pseudocode version that matches all behaviors, outputs, and edge cases precisely, but differs maximally in naming, structure, style, and flow. Your rewritten code must adhere strictly to these rules:

**Mandatory:**  
- Preserve every **class name**, **function name**, **class/object hierarchies**, and **function signatures** exactly as in the original. Do NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder functions or classes beyond original order.  
- The rewritten pseudocode must have exactly the same functional semantics, side effects, outputs, and handle all corner cases identically to the original.  
- Variable names, parameter names (except those in function signatures), and local identifiers must be changed substantially and consistently.  
- You must change data structures wherever possible with semantically-equivalent alternatives (e.g., replace arrays with linked lists, stacks with queues, maps with dictionaries, sets with boolean arrays, etc.), only if they preserve exact behavior.  
- Control flow should be restructured heavily: substitute for-loops with while-loops or recursion where possible; replace if-else chains with switch-case or ternary expressions; reorder independent statements; split or merge blocks where semantics allow.  
- Rewrite expressions using alternate but equivalent logical and arithmetic representations (e.g., replace `a + b` with `b + a`, use De Morgan’s laws, replace increments with equivalent assignments).  
- Use different styles/idioms consistently throughout (e.g., prefix/postfix increments, different loop constructs, alternate indexing strategies).  
- Remove all comments and any extraneous outputs, explanations, or text. Output only the cleaned, rewritten pseudocode.

**Forbidden:**  
- Do NOT rename, remove, add, or reorder any classes or functions other than adjusting body internals as specified. Signature names and hierarchical structure must remain exactly intact.  
- Do NOT introduce any new behaviors, side effects, changes to the computational complexity beyond what the logic already implies.  
- Do NOT produce any code or output besides the rewritten pseudocode itself.

**Additional instructions:**  
- Your output must be valid pseudocode, consistent in style, clear, and syntactically plausible, but need not match any particular language syntax.  
- Focus on maximizing lexical and structural dissimilarity while preserving identical functionality.  
- Assume the input pseudocode contains only imperative constructs, declarative data typing, and basic control flows typical in algorithm descriptions.  
- Ensure any recursion or iteration you substitute is semantically sound and terminates under the same conditions as the original.  
- When altering data structures, ensure equivalent semantics (e.g., order of iteration over a map’s keys preserved if order is relied upon).  
- Use meaningful but changed variable names that do not hint at their originals.  
- Avoid subtle bugs: the generated pseudocode must be executable and logically equivalent.

**Output only** the rewritten pseudocode fulfilling all the above requirements. No additional text, explanations, or markup.
