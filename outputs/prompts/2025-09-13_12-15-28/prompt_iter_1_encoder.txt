Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read, high-level pseudocode that uses natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. The pseudocode should be formatted as numbered steps with simple one-liners where possible. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and compactness within a 5-second generation limit.
