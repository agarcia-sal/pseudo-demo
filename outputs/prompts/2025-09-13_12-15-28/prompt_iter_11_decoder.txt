Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, efficient, and idiomatic Python code as follows:

- Implement every detail of the pseudocode exactly, preserving **all class names, method names, function signatures, input/output conventions, and data structures** without any changes.
- Place your entire answer strictly within one Python code block marked by triple backticks and `python` at the start and triple backticks at the end, with **no additional text, comments, or explanations** outside this block.
- Write clean, concise, and optimized Python code targeting high performance and correctness, able to run within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- You may freely import and employ any Python standard libraries or built-in modules to improve clarity, efficiency, and readability, but do not import unused libraries.
- Do not add any debug, print, logging statements, or comments of any kind.
- Produce ready-to-run code that would pass all typical and edge test cases implied by the pseudocode, ensuring faithful and comprehensive logic translation.
