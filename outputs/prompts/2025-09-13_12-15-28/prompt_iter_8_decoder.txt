Translate the given pseudocode into precise, complete, and executable Python code that strictly retains all class names, method names, signatures, and the overall program structure exactly as described in the pseudocode. Your Python implementation must:

- Be enclosed entirely within a single Python code block delineated by only ```python at the start and ``` at the end, with no additional text, comments, or explanations.
- Prioritize idiomatic Python style emphasizing concise, clear, and highly performant code capable of running within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Implement the full logic of the pseudocode thoroughly and accurately; partial or approximate translations are unacceptable.
- Preserve input/output method signatures, class hierarchies, and data structure definitions without modification.
- Import and utilize standard Python libraries or built-in modules as needed to ensure correctness, readability, and efficiency.
- Avoid adding any logging, debugging code, explanatory comments, or extraneous outputs.
- Ensure your output code is ready for immediate use, passing all typical tests implied by the pseudocode.
