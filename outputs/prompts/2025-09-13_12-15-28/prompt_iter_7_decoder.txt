Translate the provided pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and idiomatic Python code that strictly preserves all function names, class names, and structural compositions exactly as presented in the pseudocode. Your implementation must:

- Return **only** the complete Python code enclosed inside a single Python code block delimited **only** by ```python and ``` with no added commentary, explanation, or extraneous text.
- Optimize for both clarity and high runtime efficiency, ensuring the code executes correctly within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Leverage any relevant and standard Python libraries or packages to improve correctness, readability, and performance as needed.
- Implement the entire pseudocode completely and preciselyâ€”partial or incomplete translations are unacceptable.
- Maintain code readability aligned with Python best practices without adding debug output, logging, or comments.
