Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, clean, and idiomatic Python code that preserves all function and class names exactly as stated in the pseudocode, including maintaining the same class structures and object compositions. Your solution must:

- Return only the final Python code enclosed strictly within a single Python code block delimited by ```python and ``` with no additional explanation or comments.
- Ensure the code is efficient and can execute within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Use any standard Python libraries or packages as needed to maximize correctness and performance.
- Fully implement all aspects of the pseudocode; partial solutions are not acceptable.
- Maintain readability, clarity, and correctness without sacrificing performance.
- Avoid adding any debugging prints, logging, or commentary inside the code.
