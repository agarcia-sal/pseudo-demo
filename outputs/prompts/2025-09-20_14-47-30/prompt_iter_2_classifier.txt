Given the pseudocode below, analyze it thoroughly to determine if it is **fully reproducible**, meaning the pseudocode contains **all necessary information with unambiguous, complete, and logically correct steps to pass every possible unit test for the described functionality** without error or omission.

Output **only a single digit** with **no extra text or formatting**:

- Output **1** if the pseudocode meets all of the following criteria:  
  - Complete: defines all operations, variables, inputs, and outputs clearly  
  - Unambiguous: free from any vagueness, inconsistency, or missing details  
  - Correct: logically sound and aligns with expected behavior to pass *all* relevant unit tests  

- Output **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, logically flawed, or otherwise insufficient to guarantee passing all unit tests.

No explanation, no whitespace or newline other than the single character output.

Process multiple pseudocode inputs in order; the output digits must correspond exactly to the input order.  
Strictly provide only the reproducibility digit (1 or 0) per input.

You have up to 5 seconds to analyze and respond per inputâ€”prioritize precision and completeness within this time.
