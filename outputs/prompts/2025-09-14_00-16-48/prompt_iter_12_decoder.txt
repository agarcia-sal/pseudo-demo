Translate the given pseudocode into complete, fully executable, and idiomatic Python 3 code that strictly preserves all original class names, method names, signatures, and class inheritance exactly as described in the pseudocode, without adding, removing, or modifying them in any way.

Your implementation **must** follow these detailed requirements:

- Convert all pseudocode literals such as `null`, `None`, or equivalents to proper Python `None` in all contexts, including input data for helper functions.
- Automatically create full implementations for all helper classes or data structures implied or explicitly named by the pseudocode (e.g., `TreeNode`, `ListNode`, `Node`) with commonly expected constructors, `__repr__` (or `__str__`), and utility functions for easy instantiation from lists or other serialized forms. For example:
  - For trees, implement a robust level-order builder accepting lists with `None` placeholders.
  - For linked lists, implement a builder from a list and a method to convert back to list.
- Use only Python Standard Library and the widely accepted builtin modules available by default (e.g., `collections`, `typing`, `math`, `heapq`, `itertools`, `functools`, `operator`).
- Your code must be fully annotated with type hints wherever reasonable, without altering original signatures.
- Focus on correctness and a one-to-one mapping of pseudocode semantics first; then ensure idiomatic, readable, and efficient Python code.
- Handle common edge cases gracefully (e.g., empty inputs, singleton inputs, `None`-containing inputs) in your helper structures and main code.
- When pseudocode uses operators or constructs that differ from Python syntax, translate them correctly (e.g., `++` to `+= 1`, `‚Üê` to `=`, `=` for comparison to `==`, etc.).
- Do not invent additional abstractions, design patterns, unit tests, main functions, or I/O code beyond what the pseudocode requires.
- Do not include any code related to testing frameworks, printing, or reading inputs.
- Provide a well-structured, single contiguous Python code block wrapped exactly as follows:

```python

```
