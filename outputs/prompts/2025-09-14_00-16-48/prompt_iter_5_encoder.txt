Generate concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode that directly represents the original code’s logic, preserving all original class and function names with identical class-object structure.  
Use mostly one-line statements blending natural language, symbols, and common abbreviations to be compact yet readable.  
Focus on clear control flows, assignments, data structures, and expressions without extra comments, explanations, summaries, or notes—output only pure pseudocode.  
Retain the same function signatures as in the source. Keep pseudocode easy to read with moderate use of natural language, avoiding overly terse or cryptic expressions.  
Number each step sequentially starting with 1, strictly following this format for all lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not add any separators, blank lines, or extraneous formatting beyond numbered lines and code.  
Aim for completeness and correctness within five seconds.
