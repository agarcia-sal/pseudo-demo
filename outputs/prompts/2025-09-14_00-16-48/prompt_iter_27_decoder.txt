```python
Translate the given pseudocode into a single, fully executable, and idiomatic Python solution enclosed within one contiguous Python code block like this:

```python
# your complete solution here
```

Your translation must adhere strictly to these enhanced requirements:

1. **Exact Structural Fidelity:**  
   - Preserve all class names, method names, signatures (including parameter names and default values), return types, and class hierarchies exactly as stated in the pseudocode.  
   - Do not rename, remove, reorder, or add any methods, classes, or members.  
   - Maintain method decorators like `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod` if present.

2. **Accurate Literal and Symbol Translation:**  
   - Convert pseudocode literals `null`, `nil`, `None`, or equivalents to Python’s `None` consistently in all contexts — parameters, variables, data structures, and nested collections.  
   - Correctly translate operators and control keywords from pseudocode to Python equivalents (e.g., assignment arrows ← to `=`, logical operators, loops, and conditionals).  
   - Detect and handle any pseudocode-specific syntactic sugar or shorthand transparently into Pythonic constructs.

3. **Full Contextual Helper Code Generation:**  
   - Automatically include complete, robust definitions of all referenced helper data structures (e.g., `TreeNode`, `ListNode`, `Interval`), fully typed using Python type hints (`typing` module).  
   - Provide standard constructors and utility functions (e.g., list-to-tree, list-to-linked-list converters, equality checkers) with careful handling of `None` in nested elements.  
   - Implement these helpers idiomatically, following common community conventions (such as LeetCode style), only if they are implied or required.

4. **Self-Contained, Clean Code:**  
   - Provide only the translated code without any test scaffolding, debug prints, input prompts, comments beyond minimal necessary clarifications, or explanation texts.  
   - Abstain from any extraneous outputs; produce exactly one Python code block.

5. **Permitted Libraries and Compatibility:**  
   - Use only Python standard libraries and broadly accepted built-ins minimally and idiomatically, such as `collections`, `typing`, `heapq`, `itertools`, `math`, `functools`, and `operator`.  
   - Do not import or rely on any third-party or non-standard packages.

6. **Idiomatic, Readable, and Efficient Python:**  
   - Use modern, clear Python features and style, including comprehensions, context managers, data classes (if appropriate), and type annotations.  
   - Preserve original variable and parameter names for clarity and traceability.  
   - Ensure consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks for enhanced readability.

7. **Robust Input and Edge Case Handling:**  
   - Insert minimal necessary input validation or data conversions only when required to faithfully implement the logic described by the pseudocode.  
   - Avoid assumptions about input types—correctly handle cases when inputs are passed as Python native types (e.g., lists for linked lists or trees) or as custom objects if indicated.  
   - Guarantee safe attribute accesses and method calls to prevent runtime errors.

8. **Performance and Correctness:**  
   - Focus first on correctness and faithfulness. After correctness, optimize only lightly to maintain clarity without premature complexity.  
   - Ensure the translated code executes within 5 seconds on typical problem inputs typical for coding challenges.

9. **Explicit Handling of Pseudocode Input Placeholder:**  
   - Where indicated, replace the pseudocode placeholder `[Insert pseudocode here]` with the actual input for translation without alteration.

10. **Output Format:**  
    - Provide only one Python code block encapsulated by triple backticks and the `python` tag (```python ... ```).  
    - Do not output any additional text before, after, or within the code block.
