Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that clearly captures the original code’s logic, preserving all original class and function names and exactly the same class-object structure.  
Use mostly one-line statements combining natural language, symbols, and common abbreviations to keep it compact but readable.  
Prefer symbolic control flows, assignments, data access, and expressions; avoid verbose explanations, comments, summaries, or notes. Output only pure pseudocode.  
Retain all original function signatures exactly. Keep readable structure with moderate natural language; do not produce overly terse or cryptic lines.  
Number each line sequentially starting from 1, strictly following this exact format for all lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not add blank lines, separators, or any extra formatting beyond numbered lines containing pseudocode.  
Ensure correctness and completeness, and fit all output within 5 seconds.
