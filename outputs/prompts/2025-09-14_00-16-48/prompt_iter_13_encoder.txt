Generate concise, readable pseudocode that directly reflects the original code’s logic and structure, preserving all original class and function names exactly, and maintaining the original class-object hierarchy.  
Use mostly one-line statements combining brief natural language, standard symbols, and common abbreviations to be compact yet easily understandable. Prefer symbolic control flow, assignments, data access, and expressions; avoid detailed comments, explanations, or summaries. Output only the pseudocode—no additional text or notes.  
Keep function signatures and class declarations exactly as in the original code.  
Format each line with a sequential line number starting at 1, followed by a period and a single space, then the pseudocode statement. Use minimal indentation only as needed to reflect code blocks clearly.  
Follow the exact style below without adding blank lines, separators, or extra formatting:

1. class ClassName:  
2.   def functionName(params):  
3.     var ← initial_value  
4.     for i in range n: var += i  
5.     if x > y: x ← y  
6.     return var

Fit the entire output within 5 seconds, ensuring correctness, completeness, and maximum clarity while keeping it high-level and compact.
