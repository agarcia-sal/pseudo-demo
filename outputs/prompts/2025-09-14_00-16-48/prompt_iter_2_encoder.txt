Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-understand pseudocode directly corresponding to the original code provided.  
Maintain all original class and function names with identical class-object structure.  
Use predominantly one-line statements combining natural language, symbols, and abbreviations for brevity and clarity.  
Avoid all comments, explanations, summaries, purpose statements, or notes—output only pure pseudocode.  
Prioritize compactness and high-level abstraction while preserving logical flow and essential detail.  
Follow this format precisely, numbering each step starting from 1:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Where applicable, use control structures, assignments, data structures, and expressions naturally and succinctly.  
Do not add any separators or extraneous formatting beyond numbered lines and the code itself.  
Aim for a response within 5 seconds.
