Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that clearly and compactly captures the original code’s logic at a high level, using mostly one-line statements with a balanced mix of natural language, symbols, and common abbreviations.  
Preserve all original class names, function names, and their exact signatures, as well as the original class-object structure without alteration.  
Prefer symbolic control flows, assignments, and data manipulations; avoid verbose explanations, commentary, or summaries.  
Number each pseudocode line consecutively starting at 1, strictly in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include blank lines, separators, or any formatting beyond these numbered pseudocode lines.  
Focus on correctness and completeness, keeping pseudocode compact but understandable without being overly terse or cryptic.  
Use straightforward natural language only to the extent needed for clarity, avoiding unnecessary detail.  
Ensure the output is purely pseudocode and produced within 5 seconds.
