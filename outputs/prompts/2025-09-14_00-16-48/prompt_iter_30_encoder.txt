Generate clear, concise, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given code that preserves all original class names, function names, and the exact class-object hierarchy.  
Keep all function and class signatures exactly as in the original code.  
Express the logic primarily in compact one-line statements, blending natural language, common abbreviations, and symbolic notation to balance readability and brevity.  
Use symbolic control flow and data operations (e.g., ←, =, ++, --, &, |, <, >) and natural language verbs (e.g., let, set, read, print, return, call) only where clarity demands.  
Show recursive calls and data structure manipulations clearly but succinctly, without verbose commentary, explanations, or summaries.  
Number each line starting at 1 with no blank lines, separators, or extra formatting, exactly as in the example below:  

1. class Solution:  
2.   def functionName(args):  
3.     let x ← 0  
4.     while x < n: x++  
5.     return x  

Do not add any notes, purpose statements, or extraneous text; output only the pseudocode capturing the full logic, structure, and flow efficiently and understandably.  
Focus on correctness of control flow and data expressions, maintaining original naming and structural fidelity.  
Your response must fit within 5 seconds execution time.
