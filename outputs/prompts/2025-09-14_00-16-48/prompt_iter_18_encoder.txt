Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode that captures the original code’s logic at a high level, using mostly one-line statements with symbolic notation, common abbreviations, and moderate natural language to remain compact but understandable. Keep all original class names, function names, signatures, and their full class-object hierarchy exactly as in the source. Prefer symbolic control flows, assignments, and expressions; avoid detailed explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting—output only pure pseudocode. Follow this strict line-number format (no blank lines or separators):

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Number lines sequentially from 1. Use indentation to express blocks clearly but concisely. Always preserve function signatures and class structure as in the original code.  
Do not output any notes, summaries, or text other than the numbered pseudocode lines.  
Ensure the pseudocode is complete, correct, fits within 5 seconds runtime, and reflects original logic faithfully.
