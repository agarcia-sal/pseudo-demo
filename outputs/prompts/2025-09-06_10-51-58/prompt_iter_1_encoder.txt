Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation, keeping it compact and high-level. Write pseudocode without purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not include notes or comments. Prefer one-liners, abbreviations, and symbolic assignments. Follow this format precisely:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Your output should be only the pseudocode steps, numbered sequentially. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim for the best possible output within this limit.
