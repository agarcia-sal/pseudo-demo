Given any input pseudocode snippet, produce a fully functional pseudocode rewrite that is **maximally distinct** from the original code in all possible ways—syntax, control flow, expressions, naming, formatting, and style—while **strictly preserving all original functionality and semantics**. Adhere to the following comprehensive directives:

1. **Class and Function Structure Preservation:**  
   - Maintain all original **class names**, their exact nesting, and their declaration order unchanged.  
   - Keep all **function and method names, parameter names, types, order, and signatures exactly as in the input**, without modification or reordering.  
   - No changes outside function/method bodies are allowed; only modify the contents *inside* bodies of functions/methods.

2. **Inside Function/Method Bodies: Aggressive Transformation Scope**  
   Apply deep, diverse, and thorough rewrites inside bodies ONLY, including but not limited to the techniques below (combine multiple simultaneously for maximal divergence):

   - **Radical Local Variable & Inner Parameter Renaming:**  
     Replace all local variables and any parameters that appear inside bodies (including shadowed or re-bound parameters) with entirely new, unrelated, non-derivative names employing heterogeneous schemes (random alphanumeric mixes, varied cases, prefixes/suffixes). Consistently rename each distinct variable throughout the scope to maintain correctness and avoid collisions or ambiguity.

   - **Control Flow Overhaul & Logic Refactoring:**  
     Transform and restructure control flow across multiple dimensions:  
     • Swap among `for`, `while`, recursion, and comprehensions.  
     • Break down or merge nested conditionals arbitrarily; re-associate logical clauses applying equivalences (e.g., De Morgan’s laws, contrapositives, double negations).  
     • Invert if-conditions and toggle early returns vs nested conditionals seamlessly.  
     • Reorder independent or non-dependent statements.  
     • Split compound statements into multiple steps or combine simple sequential operations into single lines, ensuring semantic retention.

   - **Expression & Statement Diversification:**  
     Rewrite all expressions freely by:  
     • Changing assignment syntaxes among variants like `LET x BE y`, `DECLARE x AS y`, `x := y`, `SET x TO y`, etc.  
     • Represent constants by equivalent computed forms or symbolic substitutes.  
     • Reorder operands in commutative operations arbitrarily.  
     • Toggle notation styles where valid (infix, prefix, postfix).  
     • Inline expressions as anonymous/lambda functions inside bodies or abstract complex expressions into callable inner functions strictly scoped within methods.

   - **Data Structure & Collection Manipulation Variation:**  
     While class attributes and global variables must remain intact and ordered, vary internal manipulations by:  
     • Transforming standard loops into comprehensions, map/filter/reduce-inspired constructs, or vice versa.  
     • Using intermediate caching variables for repeated collection accesses.  
     • Switching direct indexing with indirect or iterator-based approaches.  
     • Alternating mutable and immutable update styles wherever possible without altering functionality.

   - **Stylistic and Formatting Randomization:**  
     Vary indentation styles arbitrarily (mix tabs and spaces), scatter or relocate comments freely (rewrite, add, remove, reposition), mix blank line distribution, and arrange statements across lines differently (combine or split). Maintain entirely valid pseudocode syntax at all times.

3. **Maintain Consistency & Correctness:**  
   - Renamings must be consistent throughout each function/method body.  
   - All semantic equivalences and original logic behavior must be preserved perfectly.  
   - The rewritten pseudocode must be syntactically valid and ready for immediate direct substitution in place of the original.  

4. **Output Constraints:**  
   - Output **only** the fully rewritten pseudocode snippet, with no additional text, explanation, metadata, or commentary.  
   - The external structure—class declarations and function/method signatures—must be exactly as in the input.  
   - All visible modifications and transformations must be confined strictly within function/method bodies.

**In essence:** Keep the *outer skeleton*—class hierarchy, function signatures, parameter lists, and class/object arrangements—unaltered. Inside function and method bodies, unleash radical, comprehensive rewrites combining variable renaming, control flow refactoring, syntax diversification, structural reorganization, and formatting variations to create a pseudocode rendition that is maximally lexically, syntactically, and stylistically distinct yet perfectly semantically identical, and immediately drop-in replaceable.

**Your sole output MUST be the transformed pseudocode snippet only.**
