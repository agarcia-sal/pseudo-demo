Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce a functionally identical but thoroughly rewritten version with maximal syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence, while strictly preserving:

1. All **class names, function names, and their exact hierarchical nesting** and **class/object structural relations** without any modification or rearrangement.

2. The **exact function signatures** and parameter lists, unchanged.

Transform everything else as follows to maximize difference yet maintain semantic equivalence:

- Rename **all variables and temporary identifiers** using semantically consistent but distinct names, employing varied casing styles (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, UPPER_CASE), synonyms, or abstract descriptors. Different occurrences of the same original variable must be renamed consistently but distinct from original naming.

- Rewrite **all control flow constructs** by substituting equivalents:
  - Replace `for` loops with equivalent `while` loops, recursion, or iterator-based constructs.
  - Convert conditionals freely among `if`, `unless`, guard clauses, early returns, logical negations, and De Morgan’s transformations.
  - Reorder instructions and blocks where safe, ensuring overall behavior is unchanged.
  - Replace increments/decrements with explicit assignment, or vice versa.
  - Use alternative loop exit criteria or structure transformations that preserve logic.

- Reformulate all **expressions and statements** using algebraic/logical equivalences and alternate phrasing:
  - Syntactic variants for math: e.g., `LET x BE y PLUS z` instead of `x = y + z`.
  - Logical expressions inverted or restated (`NOT (a AND b)` → `(NOT a) OR (NOT b)`).
  - Use synonyms or alternative natural language constructs for assignments (`SET`, `DECLARE`, `INITIALIZE`, `ASSIGN`, `LET ... BE`, `UPDATE`).
  
- Modify layout comprehensively:
  - Change indentation style and level diversity arbitrarily.
  - Insert/remove blank lines or grouping lines strategically.
  - Vary comment presence freely – can be omitted or relocated.
  - Break or merge statements, but preserve statement atomicity.
  
- Keep **all data structures and method calls identical in semantics and usage** but you may refactor the way they are constructed or accessed internally, as long as it does not alter functionality.

- Do **not** change any function or method signatures, class declarations, or their ordering; only rewrite bodies.

- The output must contain **only the rewritten pseudocode snippet**, no additional text, explanation, or metadata.

- Guarantee the output is syntactically valid pseudocode and can serve as a drop-in replacement preserving exact behavior.

Your rewritten pseudocode should be stylistically and syntactically as distinct as possible from the input, achieving minimal overlap in code patterns, variable names, control structures, and layout, while respecting all the constraints above.
