Given a pseudocode snippet as input, produce a fully reimagined pseudocode version that retains exact functionality and semantic equivalence while maximizing syntactic, stylistic, and structural divergence from the original. Follow these strict constraints and transformation guidelines:

- **Preserve exactly all class names, nesting levels, and the hierarchical structure of classes and objects.**  
- **Keep every function and method name unchanged, together with their parameter lists (order and names). No renaming or reordering of these.**  
- **Every alteration must occur exclusively inside function/method bodies: variable names (local and parameters except in signatures), control flows, expressions, statements, comments, formatting, and code layout may be transformed arbitrarily.**

To maximize divergence while preserving semantics, perform these comprehensive transformations before output:

1. **Variable and Identifier Renaming:**  
   - Completely rename all local variables and non-signature parameters with newly generated, non-overlapping identifiers dissimilar in style and spelling to the original.  
   - Keep the renaming consistent across the entire code snippet. Use diverse schemes such as: abstract labels (var1, tmpA), synonyms, randomized letter patterns, alternate casing (snake_case, camelCase, ALLCAPS), numeric suffixes/prefixes.  
   - Avoid any resemblance or partial reuse of original names.

2. **Control Flow Recomposition:**  
   - Convert all loops (`for`, `while`, `repeat`, etc.) into semantically equivalent alternatives, e.g., change iteration type, unroll into recursion with accumulator parameters, use sentinel loops, or implement loop bodies differently.  
   - Rewrite conditions via logical negations, De Morgan’s laws, switch between `if`, `unless`, early returns, guard clauses, and nested or flattened blocks arbitrarily.  
   - Reorder independent statements and split or merge blocks of code without changing observable effects.  
   - Replace increments/decrements with explicit arithmetic assignments and vice versa, or equivalent compound assignments.  
   - Inline simple functions/callables where possible and extract complex expressions into functions if applicable (without changing signatures).

3. **Expression and Statement Variation:**  
   - Express all assignments and declarations with interchangeable keywords and phrases: e.g., `LET x BE y`, `DECLARE x AS y`, `x := y`, `SET x TO y`, etc.  
   - Recast arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions algebraically or logically (e.g., use `(NOT a) OR b` instead of `IF a THEN b ELSE c` patterns).  
   - Shuffle operands when commutative, rewrite constants as expressions (e.g., `TEN MINUS FIVE` instead of `5`), or symbolize constants via sums/products.  
   - Use multiple syntactic styles for the same construct and alternate between infix, prefix, and postfix notations if the original style allows.

4. **Data Structures and Calls:**  
   - Do not alter the types of class-level variables, attribute names, or method signatures or calls (names and arguments must remain the same and in order).  
   - Internally, initialize, populate, or traverse collections using different idiomatic approaches (e.g., comprehensions vs. explicit loops, accumulating results via maps or filters).  
   - Access elements via equivalently indexed expressions, indirect references, or temporary variables.

5. **Formatting and Style:**  
   - Randomly vary indentation style and level (tabs, spaces, mixed), intersperse or remove blank lines.  
   - Rearrange, relocate, paraphrase, insert, or remove comments anywhere, or drop comments totally.  
   - Join multiple statements on one line or break single statements into multiple lines, preserving correctness.  
   - Use varied whitespace patterns generously.

6. **Output Requirements:**  
   - Provide only the rewritten pseudocode snippet as output. Do not output explanations, metadata, or any text beyond the final pseudocode.  
   - The output pseudocode must be syntactically correct and conventionally consistent to serve as a drop-in replacement preserving all original functionality exactly.

In summary:  
**Maintain the original classes and functions’ names and their exact hierarchical structures intact. Rewrite everything else — local variable names, all control and data flow logic inside functions, expressions, statements, comments, and style — to produce a maximally different yet semantically identical pseudocode substitute. Output solely the rewritten pseudocode snippet, ready for direct use.**
