Given any input pseudocode snippet, fully rewrite all function and method bodies into a semantically identical pseudocode version that maintains the original behavior perfectly but is maximally distinct in all lexical, structural, and stylistic aspects. Follow these strict directives:

1. **Preserve all class and object declarations exactly**, including their names, nesting, and order. Never rename, reorder, merge, or split classes or objects outside method bodies.

2. **Preserve all function and method signatures exactly**, including function/method names, parameter names and their order, and return types. Only modify code inside function/method bodies.

3. **Rewrite all function and method bodies exclusively.**  
   No changes permitted outside bodies.

4. **Within all function/method bodies, perform these transformations exhaustively and consistently:**

   - **Local Variable and Parameter Renaming:**  
     Rename every local variable and shadowed parameter inside bodies to unique, non-derivative, semantically unrelated identifiers. Use varied styles such as random alphanumeric strings, mixed upper/lower case, prefixes/suffixes, or symbolic names. Apply one-to-one consistent renaming throughout each body, avoiding collisions and any lexical similarity to original names.

   - **Control Flow Reconstruction:**  
     Transform loop types (for ↔ while, iterative ↔ recursive), reorder or restructure independent statements, flatten or deepen conditional nesting, invert logical conditions using equivalences (including De Morgan’s laws, double negation), merge multiple branches or split complex conditions into multiple steps, and interchange early returns with guard clauses—all while preserving exact semantics.

   - **Expression Rewriting:**  
     Replace constant literals with equivalent expressions (e.g., `2*3` for `6`), reorder operands of commutative operations arbitrarily, toggle between prefix/infix/postfix notation when valid, inline or extract sub-expressions into anonymous inner functions or lambdas within bodies only, and vary assignment syntaxes (e.g., `LET x BE y`, `DECLARE x AS y`, `x := y`, `SET x TO y`).

   - **Data Structure Manipulation Variants:**  
     Keep all class attributes and global variables unchanged outside bodies. Inside bodies, transform data structure handling by converting loops over collections into comprehensions, map/filter/reduce styles, caching repeated access in temporary variables, indirect vs direct indexing interchange, and toggling between mutable and immutable update styles where semantics remain intact.

   - **Formatting and Comments:**  
     Randomize indentation (spaces vs tabs, varying levels), reflow line breaks (combine multiple statements on one line or split one into multiple lines), insert, remove, relocate, or rewrite comments freely. Preserve syntactic correctness and readability as pseudocode.

5. **Maintain global and class-level state intact:**  
   No rename or reordering of global variables, class attributes, or method declarations outside bodies.

6. **Output only the rewritten pseudocode snippet:**  
   - Must be fully syntactically valid pseudocode, usable as a direct drop-in replacement.  
   - Preserve all original class and function/method names, nesting, and signatures exactly, without modification.  
   - Confine visible changes strictly to function/method bodies.

7. **Consistency and correctness:**  
   - Ensure uniform variable renaming per variable throughout each affected body—no inconsistent or ambiguous renaming.  
   - Preserve exact semantics, logic, and functionality of the original pseudocode in every detail.  
   - Ensure no inadvertent logic changes or subtle semantic differences occur.

**In summary:**  
Provide an aggressively rewritten, syntactically diverse, structurally transformed, semantically identical pseudocode version of the input snippet, modifying only function/method bodies without altering class hierarchy or function signatures. Output only the transformed pseudocode, ready for direct usage.
