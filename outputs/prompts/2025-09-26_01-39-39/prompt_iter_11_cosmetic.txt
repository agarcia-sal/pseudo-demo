Given **any input pseudocode snippet**, generate a functionally identical yet strikingly different pseudocode version with maximum syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence confined **only within method/function bodies**, strictly preserving the external class hierarchy and function/method signatures exactly as in the original. Your rewrite must abide by these enhanced, rigorous rules:

---

### Rules and Instructions

1. **Class and Function/Method Signatures Immutable:**  
   - Do **not** rename, reorder, merge, or split any classes or objects.  
   - Keep all class and nested class names **exactly the same** in the same hierarchical positions.  
   - Preserve every function/method name, parameter **names**, types, order, and signatures **exactly as in the original**.  
   - No changes allowed outside method/function bodies whatsoever.

2. **Transformation Scope:**  
   - **All transformations must be strictly inside method/function bodies only.**  
   - No global or class-level variables, declarations, or structural modifications outside method bodies.

3. **Variable and Parameter Renaming Inside Bodies:**  
   - Rename *every* local variable *and* every parameter **shadowed or re-bound inside the method body** to new, unrelated, non-derivative identifiers (e.g. random alphanumeric, mixed case, prefixes/suffixes).  
   - Maintain a **consistent one-to-one mapping** for each renamed variable across the entire method body to avoid ambiguity or collisions.  
   - Do **not** rename global, class attribute, or parameter names that appear only in signatures or at class/global level.

4. **Drastic Control Flow Restructuring Within Bodies:**  
   - Aggressively transform control flow constructs:  
     - Swap `for` loops ↔ `while` loops ↔ recursion, flatten or increase nested conditional blocks arbitrarily, reorder independent conditional branches, invert and simplify boolean conditions using formal logic laws (De Morgan, double negations, contrapositives).  
     - Split complex conditions/statements into smaller steps or merge multiple simple statements into compound expressions.  
     - Replace early returns with conditionals and vice versa where semantics allow.  
     - Use guard clauses, loop unrolling, and recursion interchangeably.  
     - Introduce auxiliary inner functions or anonymous lambdas strictly scoped inside methods to encapsulate repeated or complex expressions, with no changes to the outer signature.

5. **Expression and Statement Diversification:**  
   - Randomize among multiple equivalent assignment forms: `LET x BE y`, `DECLARE x AS y`, `SET x TO y`, `x := y`, etc.  
   - Replace constants and literals with equivalent expressions or computed forms (e.g. `2 + 2` instead of `4`).  
   - Rearrange operands of commutative operators arbitrarily.  
   - Switch freely between infix, prefix, and postfix expression styles where applicable.  
   - Inline expressions or extract sub-expressions into named/scoped inner functions or lambdas within the method body.  
   - Vary method/variable access notation (e.g., `array[index]` vs `element at position index of array`), indexing style, and temporarily cache repeated expressions in variables.

6. **Data Structure and Collection Manipulation Variance:**  
   - Maintain all class field and global variable names, and their order, exactly as in the input, without modification.  
   - Transform collection traversals into alternative forms: loops → comprehensions or map/filter/reduce style pipelines; direct indexing → indirect references or iteration with cached temporaries; mutable updates → copies or immutable transformations where correctness permits.  
   - Shuffle safe reorderings of independent statements and operations on collections.

7. **Formatting and Style Randomization:**  
   - Apply arbitrary indentation changes mixing tabs and spaces.  
   - Randomly inject, relocate, rewrite, or remove comments throughout the method bodies.  
   - Rearrange blank lines and line splits freely.  
   - Combine multiple statements into single lines or split one statement into multiple lines, maintaining syntax validity.  
   - Use diverse keyword synonyms and phrasing where unambiguous and context-appropriate.

8. **Semantic and Functional Integrity:**  
   - Ensure perfect semantic equivalence and exact original functional behavior despite all rewrites.  
   - Output pseudocode must be syntactically valid per original conventions and immediately usable as a drop-in replacement.  
   - Maintain strict internal consistency for renamed variables and parameters.

9. **Output Requirements:**  
   - Output **only** the transformed pseudocode snippet with no additional text, explanations, metadata, or delimiters.  
   - Preserve all original class names, nested structures, and function/method signatures exactly as input, with all changes strictly confined within method bodies.  
   - The resulting code must convincingly differ in every syntactic and stylistic aspect inside method bodies, maximizing lexical and structural divergence.

### Summary

Produce a **maximally distinct yet semantically identical** pseudocode rewrite by applying deep, diverse, and aggressive transformations strictly inside function/method bodies only, while keeping the **entire external class hierarchy and functions/methods signatures untouched**. Use extensive renaming, control flow overhaul, expression reshaping, inner scoped helper functions/lambdas, alternate data handling patterns, and style randomness to ensure the transformed pseudocode is a direct, fully functional drop-in replacement with minimal lexical similarity to the original inside bodies.

**Your output must be exclusively the rewritten pseudocode snippet conforming perfectly to the above rules.**
