Given the input pseudocode, rewrite it into a functionally identical version that preserves all original function names, class names, and the exact class and object structure, but is maximally distinct in syntax, layout, naming style, control flow, and expression from the source. Avoid changing the identifiers of functions and classes. Your rewrite should employ alternative phrasing, reorder statements when safe, substitute control constructs with semantically equivalent ones, alter variable naming styles, use equivalent logic transformations, and vary indentation and comment styles to create a substantially different appearance and structure. Do not include any explanation, commentary, or extraneous textâ€”output only the rewritten pseudocode.
