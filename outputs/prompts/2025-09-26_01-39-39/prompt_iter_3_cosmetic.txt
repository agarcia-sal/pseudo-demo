Given the input pseudocode, produce a rewritten version that preserves **exactly the same class names, function names, and class/object hierarchy** but transforms **all other aspects** of the code to be as fundamentally distinct as possible while maintaining complete functional equivalence. Your rewriting must:

- Use alternative yet semantically equivalent control structures (e.g., replace `for` loops with `while` loops or recursion, switch between conditional forms).
- Apply diverse styles of variable naming (change variable names everywhere except for functions and classes), including different casing conventions, synonyms, or descriptive names.
- Rearrange independent statements or code blocks when it does not alter behavior.
- Modify expression forms by introducing algebraic or logical equivalences, operator substitutions, or equivalent function calling patterns.
- Variegate code layout: reorder declarations, alter indentation depth and patterns, change comment style or placement, and add or remove blank lines.
- Substitute common programming constructs with equivalent alternatives (e.g., use early `return` instead of nested `if`, replace incremental updates with explicit assignment expressions).
- Introduce alternative phrasing in assignments and conditions (e.g., use “SET”, “ASSIGN”, “INITIALIZE”, or natural language phrases).
- Avoid preserving exact sequences of statements when reorderings are safe and do not affect semantics.
- Do **not** change any function or class identifier names or their structural position.
- Do **not** add any explanations, commentary, or extra text—output only the rewritten pseudocode.

Your output should be a fully self-contained pseudocode snippet, syntactically and stylistically distinct from the input, but functionally identical, retaining all original class and function names exactly in their original class structures.
