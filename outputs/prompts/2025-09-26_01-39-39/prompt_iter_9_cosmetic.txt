Given a pseudocode snippet as input, rewrite it to produce a semantically identical, fully functional version that maximizes syntactic, structural, and stylistic difference from the original. Strictly adhere to the following rules:

- Preserve exactly all original **class names**, **class/object nesting**, and **function/method names** along with their full parameter lists **(names and order unchanged)**. The hierarchical organization of classes and their methods must remain intact.

- All modifications must be confined **strictly inside function/method bodies**. Outside these bodies, no renaming, reordering, or structural change is permitted.

Within the function/method bodies, apply aggressive and comprehensive transformations including but not limited to:

1. **Variable and Parameter Renaming:**  
   - Rename every local variable and every parameter (except those in function signatures) to entirely new, unrelated identifiers.  
   - Use varied naming conventions within the same snippet (e.g., randomized strings, abstract labels, mixed casing styles, numerical suffixes/prefixes) that share no partial substring or semantic similarity with original names.  
   - Maintain consistent renaming across the snippet to avoid confusion.

2. **Control Flow Restructuring:**  
   - Replace every loop construct (`for`, `while`, `repeat-until`, etc.) with semantically equivalent alternatives, such as converting loops to recursion or vice versa, unrolling loops partially, switching from index-based to iterator-based traversal, or changing loop guards.  
   - Invert and rewrite all conditional expressions using logical identities (De Morgan’s laws, negations), swap `if`/`unless`/early return patterns arbitrarily, flatten or nest branches, reorder independent statement sequences within logical constraints.  
   - Merge or split blocks, transform increment/decrement statements into equivalent arithmetic assignments, or vice versa.

3. **Expression and Statement Diversification:**  
   - Rewrite assignments, declarations, and initializations using diverse synonymous syntaxes (e.g., `LET x BE y`, `DECLARE x AS y`, `x := y`, `SET x TO y`).  
   - Algebraically or logically transform expressions, rewrite constants as expressions or symbolic computations, reorder commutative operands randomly, change notation style (infix, prefix, postfix) where allowable.  
   - Inline simple expressions or extract complex sub-expressions into new local functions or lambdas **without altering any signature**.

4. **Data Structure and Collection Handling Variants:**  
   - Do not rename or reorder class attributes, global variables, or method signatures.  
   - Internally vary collection initialization, iteration, and manipulation strategies, e.g., replace explicit loops with comprehensions or functional patterns (map, filter, reduce), use temporary variables for element access or indexing equivalently.  
   - Replace direct indexing with indirect referencing or temporary caches as long as semantics remain unchanged.

5. **Formatting, Comments, and Style Variations:**  
   - Randomly alter indentation style and depth (spaces, tabs, mixture), interleave or remove blank lines freely.  
   - Rearrange, rewrite, add, remove, or omit comments arbitrarily.  
   - Break or join complex statements into multiple lines or compound multiple statements on single lines, keeping syntax valid.

6. **Output Requirements:**  
   - Output only the fully transformed pseudocode snippet. No explanations, metadata, comments about the rewrite process, or anything else.  
   - The output must be syntactically valid pseudocode that can be used as a **drop-in replacement** retaining exact original semantics and functionality.

**In short:**  
Keep original class and function/method names and structure intact as is. Rewrite everything else inside method bodies—variable names, control flow, expressions, statements, data handling, formatting, comments—to produce a maximally distinct yet behaviorally identical pseudocode version. Output **only** the rewritten pseudocode.
