Given an input pseudocode snippet, rewrite the entire pseudocode to produce a version that is functionally equivalent but exhibits maximal syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence. Your rewritten pseudocode must strictly conform to the following:

1. **Preserve the original class and function names, as well as their hierarchical nesting and declaration order, exactly as in the input.** No renaming, reordering, or altering of these identifiers or their declarations is allowed.

2. **Do not change any function or method signatures:** keep all parameter names and their order precisely unchanged.

3. **Everything else—including all local variables, temporary identifiers, function/method bodies, control flow constructs, expressions, statements, comments, and formatting—must be transformed aggressively to maximize difference while maintaining exact behavior and semantics.**

To accomplish this, apply a wide-ranging combination of the following transformation strategies:

- **Variable and Identifier Renaming:**  
  Consistently rename every local variable and temporary identifier, using naming schemes completely disjoint in spelling and style from original names. Use systematic and contrasting casing styles, abstract labels, synonyms, random unique tokens, or numeric indices — never partially resembling originals.

- **Control Flow Restructuring:**  
  Replace all looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) with alternative semantics-preserving forms, such as recursion, iterator-style loops, sentinel-controlled loops, or inverted loop conditions.  
  Convert conditionals freely between `if`, `unless`, guard clauses, early returns, boolean negations, De Morgan transformations, nested conditionals, or logical combinations.  
  Reorder independent statements and code blocks when safe. Merge or split blocks or statements arbitrarily as long as semantics remain intact.  
  Express increments and decrements using explicit assignment statements and vice versa.

- **Expression and Statement Diversification:**  
  Re-express assignments with diverse keywords and phrasing (`LET ... BE`, `ASSIGN`, `DECLARE`, `SET`, `PUT`).  
  Transform arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions via algebraic identities, logical equivalences, or operator substitutions.  
  Rewrite constants and literals into equivalent expressions (e.g., `TEN MINUS NINE` for `1`, or `ONE BILLION PLUS SEVEN` for `1000000007`).  
  Alter operand order or expression grouping when harmless.  
  Use alternative syntactic forms for constructs, varying operator notation, and expression structure.

- **Data Structures and Method Usage:**  
  Maintain identical method calls and parameter usage exactly.  
  Change internal handling of data structures freely (e.g., build or access collections differently) without changing external behavior.  
  Reorder construction or usage sequences internally.

- **Formatting and Style Variation:**  
  Apply random and diverse indentation styles (spaces, tabs, mixed).  
  Vary line breaks liberally — split or merge code lines arbitrarily but validly.  
  Insert, remove, relocate, or transform comments arbitrarily (including omission).  
  Introduce random blank lines or remove existing ones.

- **Additional Guidelines:**  
  Avoid any renaming or refactoring of classes, methods, and their organization.  
  Ensure the output is syntactically valid pseudocode consistent with the conventions of the original snippet.  
  Guarantee that the rewritten snippet can serve as a direct, drop-in replacement without altering its runtime behavior or semantics.

**Output ONLY the fully rewritten pseudocode snippet, without any explanations, metadata, or additional text.**  
**Your rewritten pseudocode must preserve all original class names, function names, and their structures exactly, and differ as much as possible in all other respects while remaining semantically identical.**
