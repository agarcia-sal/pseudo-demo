Given the input pseudocode, generate a rewritten version that preserves all **class names, function names, and their hierarchical structure exactly as in the original**, but transforms **every other element** to be as syntactically, stylistically, and structurally distinct as possible while preserving **full functional equivalence**. Your output must:

- Emit **only** the rewritten pseudocode—no explanations, commentary, or extra text.
- Keep **all class and function identifiers unchanged**, including their exact nesting and class/object structure.
- Replace all variable names with semantically equivalent alternatives, changing casing styles, using synonyms, or more descriptive/abstract forms.
- Substitute all control flow primitives with valid alternatives:
  - convert `for` loops to `while` loops or recursion;
  - switch between `if`, `unless`, early `return`, guard clauses, or logical equivalents;
  - reorder independent statements or blocks wherever safe, avoiding any semantic impact.
- Reformulate expressions via algebraic/logical equivalences, operator substitutions, or alternative function-call patterns (e.g., use `ADD x TO y` instead of `y = y + x`, invert conditions using De Morgan's laws).
- Vary code layout dynamically: rearrange declarations, alter indentation styles and levels, insert/remove blank lines strategically, modify comment style/location (or omit comments altogether).
- Use diverse phrasing in assignments, conditions, and declarations including phrases like `SET`, `ASSIGN`, `INITIALIZE`, `DECLARE`, or natural language expressions (e.g., "LET counter BE zero").
- Introduce alternative control structures such as replacing nested conditionals with guard clauses or early exits, substituting increments/decrements with explicit assignment operations.
- Rigorously avoid repeating exact original statement sequences when order does not affect the logic.
- Maintain the same data structures and their usage semantics but apply equivalent restructuring or renaming internally.
- Do not alter or add any function signatures, class names, or their relative positions—the hierarchy must remain intact exactly as in the source.
- Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text in the output.

The output must be a fully self-contained pseudocode snippet that is syntactically valid and stylistically distinct from the input but functionally identical, strictly retaining the original class names, function names, and class/object structure verbatim.
