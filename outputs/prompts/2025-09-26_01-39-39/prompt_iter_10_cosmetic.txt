Given any input pseudocode snippet, generate a semantically equivalent and fully functional pseudocode rewrite that differs as much as possible in syntax, structure, and style while strictly abiding by these detailed rules:

1. **Preserve all original class names and their nesting hierarchy exactly.**  
   Do not rename, reorder, merge, or split classes or objects outside method bodies.

2. **Retain all function and method names with their exact parameter names, types, order, and signatures intact, including the class/object method organization.**  
   No changes permitted outside their bodies.

3. **Restrict all changes strictly to within function/method bodies only.**  
   No modifications allowed in function signatures, class declarations, or global scopes.

4. **Within function/method bodies, apply aggressive, comprehensive, and diverse transformations including—but not limited to:**

   - **Variable and Parameter Renaming:**  
     Rename all local variables and *all parameters inside bodies* (i.e., shadowed or re-bound variables), using unrelated, non-derivative, and heterogeneous styles (random alphanumeric strings, mixed cases, prefix/suffix patterns) to ensure zero semantic or substring overlap with original identifiers. Maintain consistent renaming per variable throughout the snippet, avoiding collisions.

   - **Control Flow Variability:**  
     Profoundly restructure control flows—replace `for` with `while` or recursion, flatten nested conditionals or introduce additional nesting, invert logic conditions applying logical equivalences (De Morgan’s laws, double negations), reorder independent statements safely, merge multiple condition branches or split complex statements into simpler parts, and interchange early returns with conditionals, ensuring semantic equivalency.

   - **Expression and Statement Reformulation:**  
     Use a rich variety of assignment syntaxes (`LET x BE y`, `DECLARE x AS y`, `x := y`, `SET x TO y`), transform constants into equivalent expressions or symbolic computations, reorder commutative expressions arbitrarily, toggle between infix/prefix/postfix notation where valid, inline small expressions or abstract complex expressions as newly defined (anonymous) inner functions or lambdas strictly inside the method body with no signature modifications.

   - **Data Structure and Collection Handling:**  
     Maintain all class attribute and global variable names and orders without change. Internally, vary data structure operations: convert loops over collections into comprehensions, map/filter/reduce style operations, cache frequently accessed elements in temporary variables, use indirect vs. direct indexing interchangeably, and interchange mutable vs. immutable style manipulations wherever correctness is preserved.

   - **Formatting and Style Randomization:**  
     Randomize indentation levels and styles (mix spaces/tabs arbitrarily), inject, reformat, or remove comments freely—including rewriting and relocating them—rearrange blank lines or statement line breaks, combine multiple statements in single lines and vice versa, ensuring fully valid pseudocode syntax.

5. **Consistency and Correctness Constraints:**  
   - Variable renaming consistency must be maintained *throughout all affected bodies* to avoid ambiguity.  
   - All transformations must preserve exact semantics and functionality of the original pseudocode.  
   - The rewritten pseudocode must remain fully syntactically valid and immediately usable as a direct drop-in replacement.

6. **Output Requirements:**  
   - Output **only** the fully rewritten pseudocode snippet — no explanations, notes, metadata, or extraneous text.  
   - The output must preserve original class and function/method names and structures exactly as in the input.  
   - All visible changes must be confined strictly within method bodies as described.

**In summary:**  
Keep the external class hierarchy and function/method names and signatures strictly unchanged. Within method bodies only, produce an extremely distinct, syntactically rich, stylistically diverse version of the original logic, maximizing structural and lexical divergence while preserving exact behavior. Output only the transformed pseudocode suitable for direct substitution.

**Your sole output MUST be the rewritten pseudocode snippet.**
