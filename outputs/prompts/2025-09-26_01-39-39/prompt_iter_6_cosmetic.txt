Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a rewritten version of the pseudocode that is semantically identical but maximally divergent from the original in syntax, structure, and style, while strictly observing these rules:

- **Preserve all class names, nested class/object hierarchies, and function names exactly as in the input** — no renaming, reordering, or restructuring of these identifiers or their declarations.

- **Retain every function/method signature unchanged** (parameter names and order must be identical).

- In all other aspects (bodies of functions/methods, variable declarations, control flow, expressions, comments, indentation, spacing, and formatting), rewrite freely to maximize difference while preserving exact behavior and semantics.

To achieve this maximal divergence, apply the following transformations before producing the output pseudocode:

1. **Variables and Identifiers:**  
   - Rename every local variable, parameter (except those in signatures), and temporary identifier consistently throughout the code, using substantially different naming schemes (e.g., switch casing styles, use synonyms, numerical indices, or abstract labels). Use a single consistent rename per original name but ensure they share no overlap or spelling resemblance with the original names.

2. **Control Structures:**  
   - Replace all iterations (`for`, `while`) with alternate equivalent constructs, such as recursive calls, iterators, sentinel-controlled `while` loops, or transformed loop conditions.  
   - Convert conditional forms arbitrarily between `if`, `unless`, guard clauses, early returns, nested conditions, and employ logical negations or De Morgan’s laws where possible.  
   - Reorder statements and blocks within safe limits when semantic equivalence can be guaranteed (e.g., reorder independent statements or merge/split blocks).  
   - Substitute increments/decrements with equivalent explicit assignments and vice versa.

3. **Expressions and Statements:**  
   - Rewrite assignments with alternative phrasing (`SET`, `DECLARE`, `LET ... BE`, `ASSIGN`, etc.) and reorder expression elements algebraically if valid.  
   - Transform all logical, arithmetic, and comparison expressions into equivalent forms using logical identities, algebraic rearrangements, or alternate operators.  
   - Use diverse syntactic styles for the same constructs (e.g., `LET x BE y PLUS z` versus `x = y + z`).  
   - Express constants and literals differently within semantic equivalence (e.g., `one billion PLUS seven` instead of `1000000007`).

4. **Data Structures and Method Calls:**  
   - Do not modify the types, class-level attributes, or method invocations **semantically** (method calls must remain with same parameters intact), but restructure their internal handling freely (e.g., build collections through different means or access elements using different but equivalent logic).

5. **Formatting and Style:**  
   - Apply varied indentation styles (tabs, spaces, mixed), randomize indentation levels, and alter line breaks liberally.  
   - Insert, remove, or relocate comments arbitrarily, or omit them entirely.  
   - Merge multiple statements into a single line or split one statement across multiple lines if it preserves semantics.  
   - Vary whitespace abundantly.

6. **Output Requirements:**  
   - Provide only the fully rewritten pseudocode snippet as output, with no explanations, metadata, or additional text.  
   - Ensure the output is syntactically valid pseudocode, consistent with the conventions of the original input, and able to serve as a drop-in replacement maintaining exact original functionality.

In summary:  
**Keep all class and function names and their hierarchy intact. Alter everything else—variable names, control flows, statements, expressions, formatting—to achieve maximal semantic-preserving divergence. Output only the rewritten pseudocode, ready for direct substitution.**
