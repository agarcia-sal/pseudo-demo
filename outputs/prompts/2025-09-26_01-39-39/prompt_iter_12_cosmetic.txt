Given any input pseudocode snippet, produce a **maximally distinct yet fully equivalent** pseudocode rewrite subject to these strict guidelines:

1. **Class and Function/Method Signature Integrity**  
   - Preserve **all original class names, nesting, and hierarchy exactly** with no changes in order or structure.  
   - Keep **all function/method names, parameter names, their types, orders and full signatures exactly as in the original**, without any alteration outside their bodies.

2. **Absolute Restriction of Changes to Method Bodies**  
   - Apply all transformations **only inside the bodies** of functions and methods.  
   - Do **not modify any code outside method/function bodies**, including global declarations, class declarations, or function signatures.

3. **Aggressive Structural and Lexical Diversification within Method Bodies**  
   Perform extensive and heterogeneous rewriting inside method bodies, including but not limited to the following transformation categories:  
   
   a) **Identifier Renaming:**  
   - Rename all local variables and *all parameters as referenced inside method bodies* (including shadowing or rebinding), using names with no semantic or substring overlap with originals.  
   - Use diverse naming schemes (random alphanumeric strings, mixed casing, prefixes/suffixes, non-English characters, or made-up tokens).  
   - Maintain consistent renaming throughout a given method body, avoiding collisions and preserving referential correctness.  
   
   b) **Control Flow Recomposition:**  
   - Rewrite loops interchangeably between `for`, `while`, recursion, and comprehensions where semantically valid.  
   - Reshape and reorder conditionals: flatten nested conditions, add or remove nesting, split or merge complex expressions, invert logical conditions with equivalences (e.g., apply De Morgan’s laws, double negations).  
   - Switch between early returns and conditional guards.  
   - Rearrange independent statements safely to maximize divergence in order and grouping without changing semantics.

   c) **Expression and Statement Reformulation:**  
   - Use varied pseudocode syntaxes for assignments and declarations, e.g., `LET`, `DECLARE`, `SET TO`, `:=`, or inline anonymous functions/lambdas for complex expressions internal to bodies.  
   - Replace constants with mathematically equivalent expressions or symbolic computations.  
   - Rearrange operands in commutative expressions arbitrarily.  
   - Switch expression notations (infix, prefix, postfix) where applicable.  
   - Inline or abstract subexpressions as helper anonymous functions inside methods if it improves distinction.

   d) **Data Structure Manipulation Variations:**  
   - Internally convert iterations over collections between explicit loops, comprehensions, map/filter/reduce paradigms, caching repeated accesses in temporaries.  
   - Vary indexing styles (direct vs. indirect), mutable vs. immutable updates, or intermediate temporary data structures, ensuring no semantic impact.  
   - Keep **all class/attribute/global variable names and their orders intact absolutely** (no renaming or reordering).

   e) **Formatting, Commenting, and Stylistic Disorder:**  
   - Randomize code formatting aggressively: mixing tabs and spaces, varying indentation levels arbitrarily, changing line breaks and statement combinations freely.  
   - Reposition, rewrite, insert, or remove comments liberally. Use diverse comment styles (block, inline, different phrases).  
   - Introduce or remove blank lines unpredictably.

4. **Consistency and Semantic Preservation:**  
   - Maintain perfect semantic equivalency and identical program behavior.  
   - Ensure consistent renaming and transformations within each method to avoid variable aliasing or semantic confusion.  
   - Resulting pseudocode must be syntactically valid and immediately usable as a direct, drop-in replacement for the original.

5. **Output Constraints:**  
   - Output **only** the rewritten pseudocode snippet.  
   - Keep the exact class and function/method names, and the original class/method nesting and organization.  
   - All modifications must be inside method bodies exclusively, with zero changes elsewhere.

**Summary:**  
Strictly preserve external class and method names, signatures, and hierarchy. Apply powerful, diverse, and systematic rewriting *only inside method bodies* to achieve maximal structural, syntactic, lexical, stylistic, and semantic equivalence divergence. The output should be valid pseudocode ready to replace the original code without any adaptation.
