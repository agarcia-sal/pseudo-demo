Translate the given pseudocode into fully executable, clean, and optimized Python code.  
- Enclose **only** the code in a single Python code block with triple backticks and the language tag, like this:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

- Use `input()` for all inputs without prompt strings.  
- Focus on writing clear, idiomatic, and efficient Python that runs within a 5-second timeout.  
- You may import and use any standard or well-known Python libraries to maximize correctness and performance.  
- Do **not** include any commentary, explanations, or output beyond the code block.  

Here is the pseudocode:
