Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description without providing any purpose, summary, or overview statements. Use natural language with symbolic and abbreviated expressions, favor one-liners and high-level constructs. Avoid comments or explanations. Follow this numbering and formatting style:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode is compact, understandable, and focused solely on the algorithm steps. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best results within this limit.
