Write concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode directly from the given problem description. Use predominantly natural language combined with symbolic and abbreviated expressions to keep it compact and high-level. Prefer one-line statements and simple control structures. Strictly avoid any purpose, summary, explanations, comments, or notes—output only the pseudocode steps.

Number each line starting at 1, using the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use indentation to show block structure consistently but keep the style minimal and uniform. Do not use separator lines or extra formatting beyond numbering and indentation.

Example style your pseudocode should exemplify:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
