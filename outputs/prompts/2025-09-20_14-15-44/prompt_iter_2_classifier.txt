Given a piece of pseudocode, evaluate whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”i.e., whether it unambiguously specifies a complete, logically consistent, and executable algorithm that, without any assumptions or external context, is guaranteed to pass all relevant unit tests. Reproducibility requires that the pseudocode includes all necessary steps, clear control flow, defined inputs and outputs, and no missing or contradictory information.  

For each pseudocode input, output **1** if it meets these criteria and is therefore reproducible; output **0** otherwise. Your response must contain **only** the sequence of 1s and 0s corresponding exactly in order to the pseudocode inputs provided, with no extra text, formatting, or explanation.  

Focus strictly on the logical completeness and unambiguous executability of the algorithm described by the pseudocode. Assume no external context beyond what is given in the pseudocode itself.
