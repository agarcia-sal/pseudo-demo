Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Write compact statements, preferring one-liners where possible. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format example strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure your pseudocode is clear, structured, and efficiently expresses the solution within a 5-second generation time limit.
