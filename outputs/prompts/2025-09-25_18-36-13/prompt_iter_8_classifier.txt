Given one or more independent pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully solve a problem, output exactly one digit (`1` or `0`) per snippet, concatenated in input order with no spaces, punctuation, or extraneous characters.

---

**Output `1` if and only if the snippet is fully reproducible**, defined as rigorously and unconditionally passing _all valid unit tests_ for the stated problem, meaning:

- The snippet is a **complete, deterministic, self-contained executable specification** that:
  - Covers every valid input scenario including all edge, boundary, and corner cases explicitly or by sound structural logic.
  - Completely and unambiguously defines all variables, data structures, control flows, and algorithmic steps from start to finish without missing cases or relying on external, hidden, or implicit state.
  - Ensures no possible runtime failure modes (e.g., infinite loops, crashes, exceptions, undefined behavior) exist.
  - Executes deterministically with clearly defined outputs for identical inputs, forbidding any implicit randomness, concurrency conflicts, or nondeterminism.
  - Presents algorithmic logic demonstrably sound and aligned with problem specifications or standard known correct algorithms — no partial sketches, incomplete or inconsistent logic, or critical undefined helper functions.
  - Includes explicit or logically guaranteed handling of faults, invalid inputs, and extreme or boundary values (e.g., empty inputs, minimum or maximum values, error conditions).
  - Has consistent and coherent state updates and data integrity throughout without contradictory or unreachable code.

**Otherwise, output `0`.**

### Analysis criteria (apply strictly and independently to each snippet):

1. **Completeness & Termination**  
   - All input cases and branches are comprehensively addressed—no gaps or silent assumptions.  
   - All loops and recursion terminate for every valid input; no infinite or partial executions.

2. **Self-Containment & Determinism**  
   - All identifiers (variables, arrays, helpers) are explicitly declared and initialized.  
   - No reliance on external context, runtime state, or unspecified side effects.  
   - Given same input, output is always identical.

3. **Algorithmic Correctness**  
   - The logical approach conforms fully to the problem requirements or follows a standard proven method in complete detail.  
   - No partial or heuristic fragments lacking crucial steps or definitions.  
   - Any auxiliary function/invocation is fully defined or validly included.  
   - No contradictory, unreachable, or illogical operations.

4. **Robustness & Error Handling**  
   - Explicit or logically sound coverage of invalid input, empty or edge cases, numerical limits, or failure modes.  
   - Prevents exceptions, overflows, or undefined results.

5. **Consistency & Integrity**  
   - Logical coherence in state changes and data updates — no conflicting or silent errors.  
   - No ambiguous or vague semantics in state transitions or output.

### Strict assessment instructions:

- Evaluate **only the literal pseudocode provided**—ignore comments, formatting, naming, style, or anything external.  
- If any one of the above criteria fails, output `0` for that snippet.  
- Only output `1` if the snippet clearly and completely fulfills _all_ criteria beyond reasonable doubt.  
- The output must be the concatenation of `1`s and `0`s for all snippets in order, nothing else.

### Efficiency notes:

Your evaluation must be semantically rigorous but sufficiently expedient to handle all snippets within a 5-second total runtime budget.  
Favor logically sound completeness over guesswork or superficial heuristics.

---

### Summary:

You are entrusted with certifying whether given pseudocode snippets are **fully reproducible** solutions guaranteed to deterministically pass all valid unit tests, producing a 1 for reproducible and 0 otherwise, output as a compact digit string reflecting input order, with no extra text.
