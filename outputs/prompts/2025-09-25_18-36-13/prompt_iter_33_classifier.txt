Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each purporting to fully solve a problem, your sole task is to output a single digit (`1` or `0`) per snippet, concatenated into a single string reflecting the input order, with no spaces, punctuation, or any other characters.

**Output a `1` if and only if the snippet is strictly reproducible — meaning it will deterministically pass _all possible valid unit tests_ for the stated problem, with no exceptions, failures, or undefined behavior under _any_ valid input scenario. Otherwise, output `0`.**

### Core evaluation principles (apply independently to each snippet):

#### A. **Complete, Terminating, and Exhaustive Logic**  
- The snippet fully specifies behavior covering all inputs, including edge and corner cases (empty, minimal, maximal, boundary).  
- All control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals) conclusively terminate or produce defined results without infinite loops, deadlocks, or partial evaluations.  
- No input branch or case is left unspecified, ambiguous, or partially handled.

#### B. **Unambiguous, Self-contained Semantics**  
- All variables, data structures, and operations used are explicitly declared, initialized, and updated within the snippet—there are no hidden external dependencies, implicit states, or assumptions about a runtime environment.  
- Data transformations and outputs are deterministic and consistent on identical inputs — no randomness, concurrency issues, or nondeterminism.  
- No vagueness or underspecification in how computations proceed.

#### C. **Algorithmic Correctness and Completeness**  
- The snippet fully embodies a valid end-to-end algorithm that logically aligns with the problem requirements or can be soundly inferred as correct for the intended task.  
- Partial outlines, incomplete heuristics, or mere sketches that omit critical steps or helper procedures cause failure.  
- All auxiliary functions and procedures invoked are fully defined in the snippet or validly included in-context.  
- Recognizable standard algorithms must be logically and structurally correct in core details (correct initialization, updates, and state transitions).

#### D. **Robustness and Fault Handling**  
- The snippet explicitly accounts for invalid inputs, exceptional/fault conditions, boundary values, numeric overflows/underflows, empty structures, and other corner cases.  
- It either handles or explicitly excludes error conditions to avoid runtime failures, crashes, or undefined results.

#### E. **Consistent Control Flow and Data Integrity**  
- State changes occur in a logically consistent manner; there are no contradictory updates, unreachable code segments, or silent logical errors.  
- Data dependencies and side effects are accounted for clearly within the snippet.

### Strict rules for assessment:

- **Limit your analysis purely to the snippet itself, ignoring comments, formatting, variable naming, or any external context not explicitly given.**  
- **Do not assess style, syntax variants, or superficial issues.**  
- **If any single principle is violated, output `0` for that snippet.**  
- **Only output `1` if the snippet meets _all_ the criteria beyond reasonable doubt.**

---

### Output format reminder:

- Output exactly one `1` or `0` digit per snippet in input order, no spaces, no newlines, no extra text.

---

### Performance considerations:

- Your judgment must be logically sound yet efficient enough to complete within 5 seconds per all snippets combined.  
- Prioritize decisive, semantically precise evaluation over guesswork or partial heuristics.

**Summary**: Your role is a meticulous semantic verifier of reproducibility—that is, if given these pseudocode snippets, can they be confidently regarded as fully correct, self-contained, terminating, error-free solutions guaranteed to pass _every_ valid unit test. Your output string encodes thus, per snippet, `1` for reproducible, `0` for otherwise, no more, no less.
