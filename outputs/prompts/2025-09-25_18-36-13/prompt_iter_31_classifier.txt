Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to provide a full solution to a computational problem, your task is to output a single digit (`1` or `0`) for each snippet in the exact order provided, concatenated into one continuous string, with no spaces, punctuation, or any extra characters.

**Output `1` if and only if the snippet is _guaranteed reproducible_: it deterministically and fully passes _all_ valid unit tests for the problem it solves. This means the snippet must be a complete, fully specified, unambiguous, self-contained, terminating, and logically correct algorithm with no undefined or erroneous behavior under any valid input scenario. Output `0` otherwise.**

### Rigorous evaluation criteria for each snippet (apply independently):

1. **Exhaustive Input Coverage & Termination**  
   - The snippet explicitly and correctly handles _all_ valid input cases, including edge, corner, minimal, maximal, empty, and boundary inputs.  
   - All loops, recursion, and control flows terminate correctly in _finite_ time for all inputs without infinite cycles, deadlocks, or partial computations.  
   - No cases or inputs are left unaddressed, ambiguous, or partially handled.

2. **Complete, Explicit Definitions & Determinism**  
   - All variables, data structures, functions, and operations used within the snippet are explicitly declared, initialized, and fully defined within it. No implicit assumptions, external dependencies, or hidden states.  
   - The computation is deterministic: identical inputs always yield identical outputs with no nondeterminism, randomness, concurrency hazards, or side effects beyond what is declared.  
   - Algorithmic steps are fully detailed with no vague descriptions or underspecified behaviors.

3. **Algorithmic Correctness & Logical Soundness**  
   - The snippet implements a logically correct and complete algorithm consistent with the problem requirements or unambiguously inferable as correct for the intended task.  
   - Partial solutions, sketches, or heuristics that omit essential steps or subroutines cause failure.  
   - All helper functions or procedures are included and fully specified.  
   - Standard algorithms must be structurally and operationally accurate in core logic, state transitions, and updates.

4. **Robustness & Error Handling**  
   - The snippet safely handles or explicitly excludes error/fault conditions including invalid inputs, numeric overflows/underflows, empty data structures, and other exceptional conditions.  
   - Runtime errors, crashes, undefined results, or unchecked exceptions are not tolerated.  
   - Where error handling is relevant, it must be clearly defined and integrated.

5. **Consistent Internal State & Control Flow Integrity**  
   - Variables and data structures evolve consistently with no contradictory or unreachable updates, logical contradictions, or silent omissions of effects.  
   - Control flow constructs have no unreachable code or partial logical branches causing ambiguity.  
   - Data dependencies and side effects are clearly accounted for within the snippet.

### Strict interpretation rules:

- Consider **only the snippet text itself**; ignore formatting, comments, variable naming, or external contextual information not explicitly included.  
- Do not penalize stylistic or syntactic variations if semantics are clear and complete.  
- **If any of the above criteria fail _even slightly_, output `0` for that snippet.**  
- Output `1` only if the snippet meets _all_ criteria beyond reasonable doubt, certifying guaranteed reproducibility.

---

### Output format:

- Exactly one digit per snippet, concatenated in input order, no spaces, no newlines, no extra characters.

---

### Additional evaluation guidance to maximize accuracy and consistency:

- **Analyze recursively:** fully verify that any invoked function or procedure is present and reproducible within the snippet.  
- **Edge cases matter:** scrutinize handling of minimal, empty, maximal inputs and boundary transitions explicitly.  
- **Check termination:** resolve all recursion and loops to confirm they halt for every input.  
- **Avoid guesswork:** if a detail is ambiguous, underspecified, or missing, treat it as a failure scenario.  
- **Confirm correctness:** verify that algorithmic steps adhere strictly to accepted correct logic for the described task.  
- **Validate deterministic behavior:** reject any snippet that implies nondeterminism or undeclared randomness.

Your output encodes an uncompromising semantic reproducibility verification, providing `1` if and only if the snippet is a fully correct, self-contained, terminating, error-free, deterministic solution guaranteed to pass all valid unit tests for its problem; `0` otherwise.
