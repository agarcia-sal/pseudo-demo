Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully solve a problem, output a single digit (`1` or `0`) for each snippet, concatenated into one string in input order, with no spaces or delimiters.

**Output `1` if and only if the snippet is strictly and fully reproducible—meaning it will pass every valid unit test for its problem without exception or failure under all circumstances. Otherwise, output `0`.**

To decide reproducibility, perform an exhaustive, precise, and deterministic semantic analysis of each snippet alone, ignoring comments, formatting, or any external context. Use the following refined, rigorous criteria:

---

### 1. **Exhaustive Coverage and Termination**  
- The snippet covers every input case explicitly or through sound general logic, including edge cases (empty inputs, minimal, maximal, boundary values).  
- All control constructs (loops, recursion, conditionals) terminate or yield well-defined results without infinite execution or unresolved states.  
- No implicit assumptions, missing cases, or undefined branches remain.

### 2. **Deterministic, Precise Semantics**  
- Variables, functions, and state changes are fully and unambiguously declared, initialized, and updated within the snippet—no reliance on external state, hidden variables, or unstated context.  
- Operations and data transformations produce consistent, repeatable outputs on every valid input.  
- No nondeterministic constructs or vague specifications exist.

### 3. **Complete and Correct Algorithmic Implementation**  
- The code embodies a logically sound and complete algorithm matching known or inferable problem requirements, not a partial outline or heuristic.  
- All helper functions or procedures are correctly and fully defined within the snippet or context.  
- When recognizable (classic algorithms or patterns), the pseudocode logically replicates the full correct algorithmic flow and result.

### 4. **Robustness to Fault and Edge Conditions**  
- The snippet explicitly handles invalid or special inputs, boundary values, numeric limits (overflow/underflow), empty structures, or other corner cases, avoiding undefined or erroneous states.  
- Error conditions—if applicable—are addressed or logically excluded to ensure no run-time failures.

### 5. **Control Flow and Data Integrity**  
- State variables and data structures evolve coherently, with all dependencies and side effects accounted for.  
- There are no logical contradictions, unreachable code, or disallowed operations.

---

### Strict instructions:

- **Analyze solely the code as given**, without assuming unstated input/output formats, libraries, or environment details.  
- **Do not evaluate style, syntax variants, or comments.**  
- **If the snippet fails any single one of these criteria, output `0`.**  
- **If the snippet meets all criteria beyond reasonable doubt, output `1`.**

---

### Output format:

- A single string composed only of `1` and `0` digits, corresponding exactly to the input order of pseudocode snippets.  
- No spaces, newlines, explanations, or any text besides the digit string.

---

### Performance note:

- The evaluation is time-limited to 5 seconds per batch. Strive for a logically sound but efficient analysis.
