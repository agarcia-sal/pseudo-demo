Given one or more input pseudocode snippets, each representing a full proposed solution to an unspecified programming problem, determine for each if it is **guaranteed to unconditionally pass every valid unit test** for that problem—i.e., if it is fully reproducible. For each snippet, output exactly one digit:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is logically complete, precise, and deterministic so that it will always produce correct results on all valid inputs;  
- `0` otherwise.  

**Key Instructions and Criteria for Evaluation:**  
  
1. **Full logical completeness:** The pseudocode must explicitly cover all input cases, edge cases, and termination conditions. No part of the problem domain may be omitted or left ambiguous. This includes handling empty or boundary inputs, special cases, and avoiding infinite loops.  
  
2. **Deterministic correctness:** Every operation, condition, update, function call, and return value must be unambiguously specified and logically sound, yielding correct output without contradiction or ambiguity for any valid input.  
  
3. **Self-contained and explicit:** All variables, functions, data structures, and recursive/memoization elements must be clearly defined, initialized, and maintained within the snippet itself. No hidden assumptions, unspecified external dependencies, or implicit knowledge may be required.  
  
4. **Consistent and valid control and data flow:** Control structures (loops, recursion, conditionals) must be logically correct and terminate properly. Data dependencies and updates must maintain consistency and correctness for all execution paths. Mutually recursive or iterative flows must not introduce ambiguity or incompleteness.  
  
5. **Precision in edge and corner cases:** Explicit conditionals must handle minimum and maximum inputs, empty or minimal data structures, sign and overflow cases for numerical algorithms, and other known special inputs relevant to general algorithms.  
  
6. **Faithful, complete algorithmic representation:** If the pseudocode encodes a known algorithm or technique, it must implement it fully and correctly, not just outline or sketch the approach. Partial or high-level conceptual pseudocode is insufficient.  
  
7. **No partial, ambiguous, or informal logic:** Vague descriptions, symbolic placeholders without concrete logic, incomplete or dangling statements, or reliance on unstated inference result in non-reproducibility.  
  
8. **No contradictions or logical flaws:** The pseudocode must not contain contradictory updates, unreachable code, off-by-one errors, or incorrect use of data structures that would cause failure on some valid inputs.  
  
**Assessment Process:**  
- Analyze each pseudocode snippet **in isolation**, ignoring comments, formatting differences, or stylistic variations.  
- Apply rigorous stepwise reasoning on code logic, control and data flow, initialization, and value propagation for correctness across all inputs.  
- Identify any missing cases, logical holes, ambiguous operations, unspecified variables/states, or scenarios that may cause incorrect results or non-termination.  
  
**Output Format:**  
- For N input pseudocode snippets fed sequentially, produce a single contiguous string of exactly N digits (each either `1` or `0`), in the exact order of inputs, with no spaces, line breaks, or additional text.  
- `1` indicates the snippet is fully reproducible and guaranteed to pass all valid test cases.  
- `0` indicates failure of any above criterion, meaning the snippet is incomplete, ambiguous, or incorrect.  
  
**Strictly no other outputs, explanations, or delimiters—only the concatenated string of binary digits.**  
  
**Time Constraint:**  
- Complete evaluation efficiently within a 5-second limit per overall input batch.  
  
This prompt is designed to maximize precision and avoid false positives or negatives by enforcing exacting logical rigor, explicit completeness, and deterministic correctness without relying on any external knowledge beyond the provided pseudocode itself.
