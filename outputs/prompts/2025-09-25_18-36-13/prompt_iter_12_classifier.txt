Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully solve a problem, your task is to output a single digit (`1` or `0`) per snippet, concatenated into one continuous string, in the order the snippets are provided, with no spaces, punctuation, or extra characters.

**Output `1` if and only if the snippet is _strictly reproducible_ — meaning it will deterministically pass all _valid unit tests_ for the stated problem under every valid input scenario, with no exceptions, runtime errors, undefined behavior, or probabilistic outcomes of any kind. Otherwise, output `0`.**

### Rigorous evaluation checklist (apply independently and exhaustively to each snippet):

1. **Problem Coverage and Correctness**  
    - The snippet implements a *complete, well-defined* algorithm or procedure that conclusively solves the declared problem.  
    - It explicitly handles **all possible valid inputs**, including edge, corner, minimal, maximal, empty, and special cases relevant to the problem domain.  
    - Logical correctness is fully evident or soundly inferable—it contains no partial steps, missing logic, or unsupported assumptions.  
    - If multiple functions or helpers appear, all are fully and explicitly defined or validly included in the snippet.  

2. **Termination and Determinism**  
    - All control structures (loops, recursions, conditionals) guarantee termination without infinite cycles or undetermined halting.  
    - The snippet executes deterministically: identical inputs always produce identical outputs.  
    - No randomization, concurrency, or side effects causing nondeterministic behavior are present.

3. **Clarity and Self-containment**  
    - All variables, data structures, constants, and operations are clearly declared and initialized within the snippet’s scope.  
    - There are no external dependencies, implicit states, or unstated runtime assumptions.  
    - All data transformations and side effects are explicit, unambiguous, and fully traceable in the snippet.  

4. **Robustness and Fault Tolerance**  
    - The snippet explicitly considers or safely excludes invalid inputs and exceptional cases, avoiding runtime errors, crashes, or undefined results (e.g., out-of-bounds access, null references, overflow).  
    - Boundary conditions, numeric limits, empty or null inputs, and special structures are managed with no gaps.

5. **Data Integrity and Consistency**  
    - State updates, variable assignments, and data mutations are logically consistent with no contradictions or unreachable code.  
    - Control flow paths cover all cases without ambiguity or silent failures.

### Assessment rules:

- Consider **only the given snippet itself. Ignore comments, stylistic elements, formatting, naming choices, or any unstated external context.**  
- Do **not** evaluate syntax nuances or language-specific features—focus solely on semantic reproducibility.  
- The presence of **any deficiency or ambiguity, no matter how small, requires output `0`** for that snippet.  
- Output `1` **only if all above criteria are strictly satisfied beyond reasonable doubt**.

---

### Output format:

- Output a single string of digits: one `1` or `0` per snippet, in input order, concatenated with no separators or extra characters.

---

### Performance guidance:

- Your evaluation must be logically decisive and semantically precise, completing analysis efficiently within 5 seconds for all snippets combined.  
- Avoid partial heuristics or guesswork; prioritize sound reasoning rooted in the snippet’s explicit content.

**In sum:** You act as a rigorous semantic correctness and reproducibility validator interpreting the snippet’s logic and structure. Your output signifies with absolute confidence whether each snippet is fully self-contained and formally guaranteed to satisfy all unit test cases, error-free, and deterministic—output `1` for such reproducible snippets, otherwise `0`.
