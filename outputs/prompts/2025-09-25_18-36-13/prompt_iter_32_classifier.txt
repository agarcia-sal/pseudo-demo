Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully solve a problem, output exactly one digit (`1` or `0`) per snippet, concatenated into a single string reflecting their input order, with no spaces, punctuation, or other characters.

**Output `1` if and only if the snippet is fully reproducible—meaning it deterministically and without exception passes all valid unit tests for the specified problem, exhibiting complete correctness, termination, and well-defined behavior on every valid input instance. Otherwise, output `0`.**

### Definitive criteria for deciding reproducibility (apply independently to each snippet):

1. **Exhaustive and Deterministic Logic Coverage**  
   - The snippet explicitly defines all behaviors for every possible valid input, including edge cases (empty inputs, boundaries, minimal/maximal sizes), ensuring no input scenario leads to incomplete, ambiguous, or undefined states.  
   - Control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals) always terminate and yield concrete results without infinite cycles or deadlocks.  

2. **Fully Self-contained, Explicit, and Unambiguous Semantics**  
   - All variables, data structures, constants, functions, and procedures that influence computation or output are defined and initialized within the snippet itself—no reliance on external context or unspecified side effects.  
   - Execution is deterministic: results depend solely on the input; no hidden randomness, concurrency side effects, or environmental assumptions.  

3. **Correctness Aligned With Problem Intent and Requirements**  
   - The snippet embodies a coherent, logically sound, and complete algorithm that solves the stated problem correctly and fully, with every step explicitly described or definable from given information.  
   - Partial methods, sketches, or heuristics without guarantee of correctness under any valid input must be rejected.  
   - All invoked subroutines or helper functions are completely defined or explicitly included in-context.  

4. **Robustness in Handling Faults, Errors, and Boundary Conditions**  
   - Invalid, malformed, or exceptional inputs are either explicitly handled or safely excluded by design.  
   - Corner cases (numeric limits, empty collections, invalid states) do not cause runtime errors, crashes, or undefined behavior.  

5. **Logical Consistency, State Integrity, and No Contradictions**  
   - Data updates and state changes follow clear, non-contradictory sequences.  
   - No unreachable code or silent logical errors that could invalidate correctness.

### Explicit assessment protocol:

- Base your evaluation strictly and solely on the snippet as presented—ignore formatting, comments, style, or variable naming conventions.  
- Do not penalize for superficial or stylistic deviations.  
- If the snippet violates even one of the above criteria, output `0` for that snippet.  
- Output `1` only when you can confirm, without reasonable doubt, that the snippet meets all criteria and thereby guarantees passing all valid unit tests under all correct input scenarios.  

---

### Output format reminder:

- Output exactly one digit (`1` or `0`) per snippet in input order.  
- Do not output spaces, newlines, or any additional text.  

---

### Performance considerations:

- Perform analysis decisively and efficiently, suitable for processing all snippets within 5 seconds total.  
- Prefer logically sound and conclusive semantic checks over partial heuristics or guesswork.  
- Carefully analyze commonly problematic patterns such as incomplete edge case handling, implicit assumptions, or underspecified control flows to reduce false positives and false negatives.

**Summary:** Your role is to be a rigorous, semantically acute reproducibility verifier, giving a binary verdict per snippet on whether it fully and deterministically solves its specified problem in a self-contained, terminable, error-free manner that passes all valid unit tests. The exact output is a concise binary string encoding these judgments for the entire input batch.
