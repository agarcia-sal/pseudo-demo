Given the input pseudocode, analyze it thoroughly to determine whether it contains all necessary and unambiguous logic to successfully pass **all** unit tests. This means the pseudocode must be complete, well-defined, free of contradictions, and implementable for any valid input to produce consistent and correct outputs.  
Output only:  
- `1` if the pseudocode is reproducible (i.e., guaranteed to pass all unit tests), or  
- `0` if it is not reproducible (i.e., incomplete, ambiguous, or likely to fail some tests).  
Do not output anything else.
