Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each presented as a presumed full solution to a programming problem, your task is to evaluate each snippet independently and output exactly one digit per snippet—`1` if the snippet is fully reproducible, or `0` otherwise—concatenated in input order without any spaces, punctuation, or other characters.

---

### Definition of Reproducibility (output `1` if and only if):

A snippet is **fully reproducible** if it **always passes all valid unit tests** for the problem it solves, with *no exceptions, no undefined behavior, and no failure on any valid input*, including edge and corner cases.

---

### Step-by-step evaluation criteria to decisively apply to EACH snippet:

1. **Completeness and Termination**  
   - The snippet covers **all input cases**, including boundary conditions (empty inputs, minimal, maximal, special cases).  
   - Control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals) **always terminate** and produce a definitive output.  
   - No input or execution path is left unspecified, ambiguous, or leads to partial evaluation or infinite loops.

2. **Semantic Self-containment and Clarity**  
   - All variables, functions, data structures, and procedures used are fully declared, initialized, and defined within the snippet.  
   - No hidden or assumed external state, undocumented global variables, implicit environment dependencies, or side effects external to the snippet.  
   - The logic is deterministic: no randomness, concurrency issues, or nondeterminism exist.

3. **Correctness and Logical Soundness**  
   - The snippet provides a sound, logically valid complete algorithm solving the stated problem or its clearly inferable intended task.  
   - All helper functions or procedures invoked are present, complete, and internally consistent.  
   - Partial, sketchy, or heuristic-only solutions that omit essential steps (including initialization, updates, or underlying algorithmic logic) must be rejected.

4. **Robustness and Error Handling**  
   - The snippet appropriately detects or handles invalid inputs or exceptional cases, or explicitly documents safe exclusion.  
   - No unchecked exceptions, crashes, overflows, underflows, out-of-bounds accesses, or undefined behaviors can occur during any valid input processing.

5. **Data Integrity and Control Flow Consistency**  
   - All state changes follow a consistent, non-conflicting order that preserves data integrity.  
   - There are no unreachable code segments, contradictory updates, or silent logical contradictions.  
   - Data dependencies are explicit and coherent.

### Assessment Constraints and Instructions

- Consider solely the snippet’s explicit content—**ignore comments, formatting, variable names, or stylistic details**.  
- Do not assess partial correctness, style, or syntax variants.  
- If **any** principle stated above is violated, output `0` for that snippet.  
- Output `1` only if *all* criteria are met beyond a reasonable doubt.  
- Your output must be a string of digits (`1` and `0`), one per snippet, in the same order as input, with no delimiters.

---

### Output Format

- **A single line containing a concatenated string of digits `1` or `0` only, exactly matching the number of input snippets.**  
- No spaces, newlines, punctuation, or additional text.

---

### Performance and Judgment Notes

- Ensure your evaluation is logically sound, decisive, and avoids ambiguous or probabilistic conclusions.  
- Prioritize semantic precision and completeness over guesswork or partial heuristics.  
- Your method should guarantee completion within 5 seconds for all snippets combined.

**In summary**, you act as an exacting semantic correctness and reproducibility verifier, confirming that each pseudocode snippet is a fully defined, deterministic, terminating, robust, and logically correct solution guaranteed to pass every valid unit test for its specified problem. Output `1` if so, or else `0`.
