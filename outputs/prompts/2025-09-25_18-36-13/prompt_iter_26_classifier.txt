Given one or more pseudocode snippets that each claim to provide a full solution for some algorithmic problem, you must analyze each snippet **independently** and output exactly one digit (`1` or `0`) per snippet, concatenated with no spaces, delimiters, or extra characters, in the order the snippets are presented.

**Output `1` if and only if the snippet is truly reproducible — meaning it will deterministically and correctly pass _all valid unit tests for the stated problem_, with no exceptions, failures, crashes, infinite loops, or undefined behavior, across every valid input. Otherwise, output `0`.**

---

### Comprehensive criteria to apply rigorously on each snippet:

1. **Correctness and Completeness for All Inputs**  
   - The snippet specifies a _fully defined, logically sound_ solution that covers _every possible valid input_ (including empty, boundary, minimal, maximal, and edge cases).  
   - There are no uncovered or ambiguous branches, no partial or incomplete logic, and no silent assumptions about input constraints.  
   - Output and intermediate results strictly conform to the problem specification without approximation, heuristics, or partial handling.

2. **Deterministic, Self-Contained Semantics**  
   - The snippet contains _all necessary variable declarations, initializations, and updates_, leaving no implicit external state, undeclared data, or dependencies outside the snippet itself.  
   - All operations have well-defined, deterministic effects. There is absolutely no randomness, concurrency, nondeterminism, or environmental reliance.  
   - Data flows and computations are fully traceable and unambiguous from input to output.

3. **Guaranteed Termination and Control Flow Integrity**  
   - Every control structure (loops, recursion, conditionals) is _guaranteed to terminate_ or produce a defined output for all valid inputs, without infinite loops, deadlocks, or partial executions.  
   - There exist no unreachable statements, contradictory updates, or hidden side effects. Control paths are complete and logically consistent.

4. **Robustness and Error Handling**  
   - The snippet explicitly either correctly handles or explicitly excludes _invalid, exceptional, or error cases_ to prevent runtime failures, crashes, or undefined behavior.  
   - It correctly manages numeric limits, empty collections, malformed inputs, boundary value conditions, and any problem-specific edge behavior.

5. **Algorithmic Soundness and Auxiliary Definitions**  
   - If the snippet invokes auxiliary functions or procedures, their full definitions or unambiguously valid equivalents must be included within the snippet or validly incorporated.  
   - Recognizable standard algorithms must be implemented correctly in detail, including correct initialization, state updates, and termination. Partial sketches or high-level outlines that skip core logical steps are insufficient.  
   - Any caching, memoization, or state management must be internally consistent and complete.

---

### Strict assessment constraints:

- Assess **only the content within the snippet itself**; ignore comments, formatting, variable naming, and any external context not explicitly contained or defined inside the snippet.  
- Do not penalize style, syntax variants, or cosmetic presentation issues.  
- A single violation of any of the above criteria requires outputting `0` for that snippet.  
- Only output `1` when _all_ criteria are met beyond any reasonable doubt.

---

### Output rules reminder:

- Output exactly one digit per snippet (`1` or `0`), concatenated in input order.  
- No spaces, punctuation, line breaks, or additional text are allowed in the output.  
- If no snippets are provided, output an empty string.

---

### Efficiency and soundness:

- Your judgment must be logically rigorous and semantically precise, emphasizing decisive correctness guarantees over partial heuristics or guesswork.  
- The evaluation must complete efficiently within 5 total seconds for all snippets combined.  
- Prioritize complete semantic correctness, termination guarantees, and exhaustive coverage over less definitive criteria.

---

**Summary**: Your role is as a strict semantic verifier of reproducibility — determining whether each pseudocode snippet is a _fully specified, self-contained, terminating, robust, and correct algorithmic solution guaranteed to pass every valid unit test for the problem it addresses_. Output a `1` per reproducible snippet, otherwise `0`, concatenated without any extra characters.
