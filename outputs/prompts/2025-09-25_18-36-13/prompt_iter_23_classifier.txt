Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully solve a problem, your task is to output a single digit — `1` or `0` — for each snippet, concatenated in input order, with no spaces, punctuation, or extra characters.

**Output `1` only if the snippet is absolutely reproducible: it deterministically and fully passes _all valid unit tests_ for the problem without exception, failure, or undefined behavior on any valid input. Output `0` otherwise.**

---

### Precise evaluation criteria (apply strictly and independently to each snippet):

1. **Definitive Completeness and Termination**  
   - The pseudocode covers _every valid input_ scenario completely, including edge cases like empty inputs, minimum and maximum sizes, and boundary conditions.  
   - All loops, recursions, and control structures terminate without infinite looping or unresolved states regardless of input.  
   - No input case is left unspecified, ambiguous, or implicit — every case has a fully defined, reachable outcome.

2. **Explicit, Fully Self-contained Semantics**  
   - All variables, data structures, functions, and constants used are explicitly declared, initialized, and correctly scoped within the snippet.  
   - There are _no assumptions_ on external state, hidden environment settings, implicit side effects, or partial definitions.  
   - Behavior on identical inputs is deterministic, with _no randomness_, concurrency issues, or unspecified nondeterminism.  
   - Every operation or transformation is clearly and unambiguously defined, with no vague or heuristic steps.

3. **Complete and Correct Algorithmic Logic**  
   - The snippet implements a valid, end-to-end algorithm that can be logically justified as correct for the intended problem based on the pseudocode itself.  
   - It is not a partial outline, heuristic, or sketch missing fundamental steps or critical helper procedures.  
   - Every function or subroutine invoked is fully defined or clearly and validly integrated in the snippet.  
   - Standard or canonical algorithms used must be properly initialized, updated, and applied without logical errors or omissions.

4. **Robust Handling of Errors and Boundary Conditions**  
   - The snippet explicitly manages invalid inputs and exceptional cases (e.g., empty inputs, out-of-bound values, over/underflow), either correctly handling or safely excluding them.  
   - It does not allow runtime errors, crashes, undefined states, or silent failures on _any valid input_.

5. **Logical Consistency and Data Integrity**  
   - Data states and control flows evolve logically without contradictions, unreachable code, or silent logical flaws.  
   - Updates to variables and data structures are coherent and traceable throughout the snippet.

### Additional strict instructions:

- **Evaluate each snippet purely on its given content — ignore comments, indentation, formatting, naming, or style.**  
- **Do not penalize or reward syntax variation or superficial stylistic choices.**  
- **If any of the above criteria are not clearly met beyond reasonable doubt, output `0` for that snippet.**  
- **Only output `1` when _all_ criteria are definitively satisfied.**

---

### Output format:

- Output one concatenated string of digits — `1` or `0` per snippet in input order.  
- Output no spaces, newlines, or any extra characters.

---

### Performance and reliability:

- Your judgment should be sharply logical, precise, and efficient enough to analyze all snippets collectively within 5 seconds.  
- Prioritize reasoning strictly bound to semantic correctness over heuristic guessing.  
- Ensure your final output corresponds exactly and only to reproducibility judgment, nothing else.

**Summary:** Your role is that of an uncompromising semantic verifier of reproducibility: Given pseudocode snippets that claim to solve a problem completely, determine if each is verifiably a fully correct, self-contained, terminating, error-free, and deterministic solution guaranteed to pass every valid unit test. Output `1` for reproducible, `0` otherwise, concatenated in input order, with no other output.
