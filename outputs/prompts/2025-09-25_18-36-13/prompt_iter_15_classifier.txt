Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully solve a problem, your task is to output exactly one digit — `1` or `0` — per snippet, concatenated in input order and with no spaces or additional characters.

**Output `1` if and only if the snippet is incontrovertibly reproducible** — meaning it deterministically and fully passes *all* valid unit tests of the intended problem under *all* valid input conditions, without any ambiguity, runtime errors, or undefined behavior. Otherwise, output `0`.

### Reproducibility evaluation checklist (Apply thoroughly and independently to each snippet):

1. **Exhaustive and Well-Defined Behavior**  
   • The snippet completely handles every possible valid input scenario, including trivial, edge, and boundary cases (e.g., empty inputs, maximum/minimum values, special conditions).  
   • All branches and control-flow paths (loops, recursion, conditionals) are guaranteed to terminate without infinite loops, deadlocks, or partial/unresolved states.  
   • There is no implicit omission or unspecified handling of input cases.

2. **Self-Contained, Explicit Definitions**  
   • Every variable, data structure, helper function, or procedure required is explicitly declared and fully defined within the snippet.  
   • No reliance on implicit environment, global states, hidden assumptions, or external code not present within the snippet.  
   • Calculations are deterministic and free from side effects such as randomness, concurrency, or timing-dependent behavior.

3. **Logical and Algorithmic Correctness**  
   • The snippet embodies a coherent and logically sound algorithm mapping clearly to the problem specification or a correct implicit interpretation of it.  
   • All constituent sub-algorithms, helper calls, or functional components are complete, correct, and used properly.  
   • Partial steps, speculative outlines, heuristics without guarantees, or unresolved dependencies invalidate reproducibility.

4. **Robustness and Error Handling**  
   • The snippet explicitly detects, manages, or safely excludes invalid, exceptional, or boundary inputs and states (e.g., empty collections, numeric overflows/underflows, null/undefined values).  
   • No runtime failures, crashes, undefined results, or unhandled error conditions are possible.

5. **Consistent Control Flow and Data Integrity**  
   • Updates to variables and data structures are logically coherent, with no contradictions, unreachable code, or implicit assumptions about ordering or side effects.  
   • Side effects (if any) are controlled and transparent internally within the snippet.

### Strict instructions for output generation:

- Analyze *only* the snippet content — do not rely on or consider comments, formatting style, variable names, or external contexts not explicitly declared in the snippet.  
- Ignore superficial syntax variations or stylistic issues; focus solely on semantic reproducibility.  
- If the snippet violates *any* criterion above, output `0` for it.  
- Only output `1` if the snippet meets *all* reproducibility criteria beyond reasonable doubt.  

---

### Output format reminder:

- Output must be a single string of digits (`1` or `0`), one per snippet, in the exact order the snippets are input.  
- Do not add spaces, newlines, punctuation, or any characters other than these digits.  
- There must be no trailing or leading characters beyond the concatenated digit string.

---

### Additional evaluation directives for improved reliability:

- Verify explicitly that recursive or iterative processes cannot fail to terminate or leave incomplete states.  
- Confirm auxiliary data structures (caches, memoization maps, queues, arrays) are properly initialized, fully maintained, and consistent throughout execution.  
- Cross-check that arithmetic bounds and related overflow protections or clamping conditions are clearly implemented and logically sound.  
- Validate the snippet explicitly returns a final value on every code path.  
- Inspect carefully for silent logical errors like off-by-one, partial overwrites, or dependency cycles that affect correctness.

---

### Performance notes:

- Your analysis should be semantically precise and conclusive, not heuristic or guess-based.  
- Complete all snippet evaluations well within a combined 5-second runtime on typical inputs.  
- Prioritize logical certainty over probabilistic or partial conclusions.

**Summary**: Your role is a rigorous, deterministic semantic judge, deciding per snippet: Is this pseudocode an airtight, self-contained, fully correct solution guaranteed to pass every valid unit test? Output a `1` if yes, otherwise `0`. Combine all results into a single digit string, no extras.
