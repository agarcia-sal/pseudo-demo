Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each proposed as a complete solution, your task is:

**For each snippet independently, output exactly one digit:  
`1` if the snippet is fully reproducible—i.e., guaranteed to deterministically pass all valid unit tests for the described problem without failure, ambiguity, runtime errors, or undefined behavior under any valid input; otherwise `0`.**

Concatenate these digits exactly in the input order, with no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or other characters.

### Definitive criteria to assign `1` (otherwise `0`), applied rigorously per snippet:

1. **Full Problem Coverage and Termination**  
   - The snippet explicitly and completely handles every valid input scenario, including all boundary, empty, minimal, and maximal cases.  
   - Control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals) are guaranteed to terminate and never cause infinite loops or deadlocks.  
   - No partial, vague, or missing branches; every conditional and loop covers all logically possible cases.

2. **Clear, Self-Contained, Unambiguous Semantics**  
   - All variables, data structures, constants, and operations are fully declared, initialized, and modified inside the snippet itself.  
   - No reliance on hidden global state, external environment behavior, or unstated assumptions.  
   - No sources of nondeterminism such as randomization, concurrency, or unspecified evaluation order.  
   - All expressions and statements have fully defined, unambiguous meaning and effects.

3. **Complete Correctness of Algorithm**  
   - The logic implements a sound algorithm exactly matching the intended problem statement or is clearly and correctly inferred as correct.  
   - All helper functions and procedures are fully included and correctly defined in the snippet.  
   - No incomplete sketches, placeholders, missing steps, or underspecified strategies.  
   - If standard algorithms are represented, core operational details (initialization, transitions, updates) must be correct and rigorous.

4. **Comprehensive Error and Edge Case Handling**  
   - The snippet explicitly anticipates and correctly processes invalid inputs, exceptional scenarios, and boundary conditions to avoid runtime errors, crashes, or undefined behavior.  
   - All numeric overflows, underflows, empty inputs, or abnormal cases are either handled or explicitly ruled out and not ignored.

5. **Consistent Control Flow and Data Integrity**  
   - Execution paths logically cohere without contradictions, unreachable code, or silent failures.  
   - Data states and updates are consistent, valid, and correctly synchronized throughout execution.  
   - Side effects and state changes are transparent, fully accounted for, and do not cause undefined interactions.

### Strict evaluation instructions:

- Analyze **only** the content of each snippet as presented.  
- Ignore comments, formatting styles, variable names, and surface syntax differences.  
- Do not guess intent beyond what the snippet logically guarantees.  
- Any single violation of the above criteria demands output `0` for that snippet.  
- Output `1` only if **all** criteria are confidently and rigorously met.

---

### Output requirements:

- Output a single uninterrupted string of digits (`1` or `0`), one digit per snippet, in input order.
- No spaces, newlines, punctuation, or extra characters.
- No additional explanation or commentary.

---

### Efficiency and decisiveness:

- Your analysis must be logically rigorous yet computationally efficient, completing within 5 seconds total for all snippets.
- Prioritize clear-cut semantic evaluation over uncertainty or probabilistic heuristics.
- When in doubt or ambiguity, assign `0`.

**In summary:** Your role is to act as a precise semantic oracle on pseudocode reproducibility—verifying if each snippet encodes a fully correct, self-contained, terminating, fault-tolerant solution guaranteed to pass all possible valid tests. Output exactly `1` for reproducible, `0` otherwise, concatenated in order, nothing more.
