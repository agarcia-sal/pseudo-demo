Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully solve a distinct problem, your task is to produce exactly one digit per snippet—`1` if and only if the snippet is fully reproducible, or `0` if not. Output all digits concatenated as a single string reflecting the input order, with no spaces, newlines, punctuation, or any extra characters.

**Definitions:**

- A pseudocode snippet is **reproducible** (`1`) if it deterministically passes all valid unit tests for the stated problem, without exception, failure, or undefined behavior, on **every valid input** (including empty, minimal, maximal, and boundary cases).

- Otherwise, output `0`.

---

### Evaluation Criteria (apply independently to each snippet):

1. **Total and Precise Input Coverage**  
   - The snippet explicitly handles every _possible valid input_ and all edge cases relevant to the problem domain.  
   - All branches, conditions, loops, and recursive calls are exhaustively defined—no input, case, or control path is overlooked, ambiguous, or incompletely specified.  
   - No partial or tentative logic; the snippet must either provide a definitive, terminating action for every input scenario or validly exclude impossible inputs with clear reasoning.

2. **Deterministic, Autonomous Semantics**  
   - All variables, data structures, constants, and helper routines invoked are fully declared, initialized, and defined _within the snippet_; no external dependencies, hidden globals, or unspecified runtime assumptions.  
   - Computations and outputs are deterministic and free from randomness, concurrency issues, or nondeterminism.  
   - The snippet must not rely on implicit side effects, environment behavior, or unspecified external context.

3. **Correctness and Algorithmic Integrity**  
   - The core algorithm correctly and completely realizes the problem’s requirements or can be unambiguously inferred to do so.  
   - Partial, skeletal, or heuristic outlines that omit critical steps or helper definitions fail.  
   - Every auxiliary function/procedure/call used must be fully present or validly included in the snippet.  
   - If standard algorithmic patterns appear, their principal logical steps, state transitions, and termination conditions must be sound and consistent with recognized correctness criteria.

4. **Guaranteed Termination and Output Definiteness**  
   - All loops and recursion terminate for all valid inputs; no infinite loops, unbounded recursion, deadlocks, or partial computations occur.  
   - The snippet yields a clearly defined output or return value in _every execution path_.  
   - No partial, interrupted, or undefined evaluation states remain by the end of the snippet.

5. **Robustness and Fault Resilience**  
   - The snippet handles or explicitly rejects invalid, malformed, or exceptional inputs gracefully with defined behavior (exceptions, error returns, or documented exclusions).  
   - It protects against numeric overflow/underflow, indexing errors, empty data structures, and other corner cases that could cause runtime failure or incorrect results.

6. **Internal Logical Consistency and Data Integrity**  
   - Data mutations and state transitions are logically consistent—no contradictory updates, unreachable statements, or silent logical conflicts.  
   - Side effects and dependencies are explicit and valid within the snippet’s scope.

### Strict assessment rules:

- Assess **only the pseudocode snippet as given**, disregarding comments, formatting, style, or variable names. Do **not** infer external context or runtime environment details beyond what is explicit.  
- Do **not** penalize minor syntax or superficial stylistic issues; focus solely on semantic correctness, completeness, and reproducibility.  
- If the snippet violates a single criterion above _for any valid input or execution path_, output `0` for that snippet.  
- Output `1` only if the snippet confidently meets _all_ criteria without reasonable doubt.

---

### Output format reminder:

- Single concatenated string of digits (`1` or `0`), one per input snippet, exactly in input order, with no spaces or extra characters.

---

### Efficiency considerations:

- Your evaluation should be logically rigorous yet computationally efficient to complete analysis within 5 seconds total for all snippets.  
- Prioritize firm semantic judgments over heuristic guesses or uncertainty.

**Summary:** You act as an uncompromising verifier of a pseudocode snippet’s **full reproducibility**—whether it is an entirely self-contained, deterministic, terminating, logically sound solution guaranteed to pass _every_ valid test case of its claimed problem. Your output encodes this verdict as a binary string denoting reproducibility per snippet, and nothing else.
