Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to fully solve a stated problem, your task is to output a single digit (`1` or `0`) for each snippet in the exact input order, concatenated into one continuous string with no spaces, punctuation, or extra characters.

**Output `1` if and only if the snippet is strictly reproducible, which means: it deterministically and unconditionally passes every conceivable valid unit test for the problem it solves, without failing, producing undefined behavior, or relying on any external assumptions. If a snippet fails to meet these criteria, output `0`.**

### Evaluation criteria — apply independently and exhaustively to each snippet:

1. **Total and Precise Specification of Behavior**  
   - The snippet completely covers all inputs, including trivial, edge, and boundary cases (empty inputs, minimum/maximum input sizes, special values).  
   - All control flows (loops, recursion, branches) always terminate with defined results on all valid inputs; no infinite loops, missing base cases, or premature exits that leave execution incomplete.  
   - No input scenario or execution path is left unhandled, ambiguous, or partially defined.

2. **Self-Containment and Explicitness**  
   - All variables, constants, state, and data structures are explicitly declared, initialized, and mutated within the snippet; no hidden dependencies, external state, or implicit environment assumptions.  
   - No external libraries, APIs, or runtime behaviors are assumed unless fully defined or specified in the snippet.  
   - The computations are deterministic and reproducible: no randomness, concurrency, timing dependencies, or nondeterministic elements.

3. **Algorithmic Soundness and Completeness**  
   - The snippet expresses a logically coherent, end-to-end solution correctly implementing the target problem as stated or clearly implied.  
   - Partial outlines, unclear heuristics, placeholders, or stubs lacking full implementation cause failure.  
   - All called procedures and helper functions are fully provided and invoked correctly; no undefined references.  
   - Standard algorithms, if used, must reflect their canonical logic without errors or skipping essential steps.

4. **Robustness, Safety, and Error Handling**  
   - The snippet explicitly and correctly addresses invalid inputs, exceptions, boundary conditions, numeric overflow/underflow, empty or null data structures, and error states.  
   - It prevents runtime failures, crashes, or undefined results either by handling or explicitly documenting exclusions.

5. **Logical Consistency and Data Integrity**  
   - State and variables evolve consistently throughout execution without contradictory, overwritten, or logically impossible updates.  
   - No unreachable code or dead code that impacts correctness negatively.  
   - Side effects and dependencies between variables and results are accounted for clearly within the snippet.

### Strict rules and instructions:

- Analyze **only the snippet’s content as given**: ignore comments, syntax style, variable naming, whitespace, or superficial formatting differences.  
- Do **not** consider external context beyond what appears explicitly inside the snippet.  
- **If even one criterion is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, output `0` for that snippet.**  
- Output `1` only if the snippet meets *all* criteria rigorously.  
- The output is a string of digits, with one digit per snippet, reflecting the input order, no delimiters or extras.

---

### Additional guidance to enhance accuracy and robustness:

- Verify explicit initialization of all used variables before use, including loop counters and accumulators.  
- Confirm all loops and recursively defined calls have clearly defined termination conditions.  
- Check that return values cover all cases and do not rely on implicit defaults.  
- Identify potential partial or undefined behaviors that unit tests could detect (e.g., out-of-bound access, missing case handling).  
- Confirm the snippet’s logic matches canonical or sound interpretations of the problem (even if the problem statement is not explicitly restated).  
- Ensure any algorithmic transformations or data manipulations are fully deterministic and precisely described.  
- Assess auxiliary function definitions for completeness and correctness; missing helper definitions invalidate the snippet.

### Performance and output format:

- Your evaluation must complete efficiently (within 5 seconds total for all snippets).  
- Prioritize logical certainty and semantic rigor over guesswork or probabilistic heuristics.  
- **Output only the concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s corresponding to each snippet in input order.**

---

**In summary:** Your role is a strict semantic validator of whether each pseudocode snippet is a guaranteed, fully correct, terminative, self-contained, and fault-tolerant solution that can reproducibly pass *every* valid unit test for its stated problem.  
Output exactly `1` if reproducible, or `0` otherwise, concatenated seamlessly for all snippets in the order given, nothing else.
