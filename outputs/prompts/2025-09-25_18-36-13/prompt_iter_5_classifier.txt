Given one or more input pseudocode snippets, each purporting to be a full implementation solving a problem, produce a single output digit (`1` or `0`) for each snippet in the exact order given, concatenated into one continuous string with no delimiters or spaces.

For each pseudocode snippet, output `1` **if and only if** it is **fully and unconditionally reproducible**, meaning it will **pass all valid unit tests** for its problem without exceptions or failures. Output `0` otherwise.

To determine reproducibility, perform a rigorous and comprehensive internal logical analysis focusing solely on the snippet itself, ignoring comments, formatting, or external context. Evaluate the snippet against the following enhanced criteria:

1. **Complete and explicit logic coverage:**  
   - All input domains, edge cases, control paths, and branches are explicitly addressed.  
   - No implicit assumptions, partial algorithms, or skipped steps exist.  
   - All loops, recursions, and conditionals terminate correctly and handle boundary cases, including minimal, maximal, empty, or special inputs relevant to the problem.

2. **Deterministic and unambiguous behavior:**  
   - Every variable, function, and state update is precisely defined and free from ambiguity.  
   - No nondeterministic or underspecified operations occur.  
   - Results are consistent and correct across **every** valid input.

3. **Self-contained completeness:**  
   - The snippet explicitly declares, initializes, and updates all variables, functions, data structures, and helper procedures without reliance on hidden state, external libraries, or unstated prerequisites.  
   - It must not depend on informal notation or implicit context.

4. **Logical correctness aligned with intended semantics:**  
   - The implementation corresponds exactly to a sound algorithmic approach sufficient to solve the problem fully.  
   - Partial outlines, unverified heuristics, or logically flawed steps invalidate reproducibility.

5. **Robustness in error, boundary, and edge condition handling:**  
   - Handles empty, zero, null, maximum, minimum, overflow, underflow, and other corner cases rigorously and explicitly.  
   - No gaps or undefined behaviors remain for any plausible input.

6. **Consistent control and data flow integrity:**  
   - Variables and states change according to valid conditions ensuring correctness and guaranteed termination or well-defined completion.  
   - No infinite loops without base cases or recursive cycles without exit conditions.

7. **Algorithmic faithfulness:**  
   - When the algorithm implemented is recognizable (e.g., classic sorting, DP, recursion schemes), the pseudocode faithfully replicates the complete logical structure and correctness of that algorithm, not just a high-level sketch.

Apply these criteria methodically, step-by-step, analyzing only the provided pseudocode snippet(s). Disregard stylistic variations, comments, or superficial formatting differences.

**Output instructions:**  
- For each provided snippet in input order, output `1` if it meets **all** the above criteria and will pass all valid unit tests unconditionally.  
- Output `0` if it fails even one criterion, indicating incompleteness, ambiguity, or likely failure on some tests.

**Final output:** a compact, contiguous string of digits composed solely of `1`s and `0`s, with no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, explanation, or additional characters.

**Strictness and performance:**  
- Prioritize logical rigor, precision, and correctness above all else.  
- Timeout is 5 seconds per evaluation batch.  
- No extraneous output permitted.

This prompt replaces heuristic or partial judgments with a strict, logically grounded, reproducibility verification suitable for diverse problems and pseudocode styles, aimed at maximizing accuracy and minimizing false positives or negatives.
