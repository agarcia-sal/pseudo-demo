Given one or more pseudocode snippets, each claiming to provide a full solution to a problem, your task is to analyze each snippet independently and output a single digit per snippet—`1` or `0`—concatenated in exact input order, with absolutely no spaces, line breaks, punctuation, or any other characters.

Output a digit `1` if and only if the snippet is **strictly reproducible** under the following rigorous definition: it is a fully self-contained, precise, deterministic, and terminating algorithm guaranteed to pass _all valid unit tests_ for the stated problem without fail, crash, undefined behavior, ambiguity, or reliance on unspecified contexts.

Otherwise, output `0`.

### Detailed criteria for deciding reproducibility (apply absolutely to each snippet):

1. **Explicit Completeness and Exhaustiveness:**  
   - The snippet fully specifies how to handle every conceivable valid input, including empty inputs, edge, boundary, minimal, maximal, and corner cases.  
   - There are no hypothetical or implicit assumptions about inputs or states left unaddressed.  
   - All control flow paths (loops, recursion, conditionals) lead to definite, terminating results with no infinite loops, deadlocks, or indefinite waits.  
  
2. **Fully Defined, Self-Contained Semantics:**  
   - Every variable, data structure, and procedure is explicitly declared, initialized, and updated within the snippet.  
   - There are no hidden dependencies on external state, environment, libraries, or undefined helper functions.  
   - Computations proceed deterministically; no randomness, timing or concurrency effects, or nondeterministic choices exist.  
   - No vague, incomplete, or contradictory instructions are present.  
  
3. **Algorithmic Correctness and Logical Alignment:**  
   - The pseudocode correctly implements a sound, logically valid algorithm that aligns with common problem specifications or otherwise can be deduced to be a correct full solution.  
   - If standard algorithms or known patterns are used, their critical steps (initialization, update, state management) comply with known correctness criteria.  
   - If auxiliary procedures or recursion appear, they are fully defined or integrated in-context.  
   - Sketches, partial outlines, heuristics without comprehensiveness, or solutions missing essential subparts must be rejected.

4. **Robustness and Error/Fault Handling:**  
   - The snippet explicitly or implicitly handles invalid, exceptional, or out-of-bound inputs gracefully—either by properly processing them or clearly signaling/avoiding undefined behavior.  
   - Numeric overflows, empty structures, boundary conditions, and failure modes must be addressed or safely excluded by logic.  
   - Runtime failures, silent crashes, or unintended exceptions are not tolerated.

5. **Consistency and Internal Integrity:**  
   - All state mutations within the snippet maintain logical coherence with no contradictory, unreachable, or skipped code segments affecting correctness.  
   - Data dependencies, side effects, and state transitions are unambiguous and maintain integrity.

### Strict evaluation rules:

- Evaluate **only the pseudocode itself**, ignoring comments, formatting, variable names, or external context not present in the snippet.  
- Do not consider coding style or language-specific syntax variants.  
- Violation of **any single principle above** leads to output `0` for that snippet.  
- Only emit `1` when **all** these criteria are met beyond reasonable doubt.

---

### Output format reminder:

- Output exactly one digit per snippet (in input order).  
- No spaces, no newlines, no additional text or explanation—only a concatenated string of `1`s and `0`s.

---

### Performance guidance:

- Deliver logically rigorous and semantically precise evaluations efficiently enough to process all snippets within a total of 5 seconds.  
- Prefer decisive, clearly justified logic over uncertain guesswork or partial heuristics.

**In summary:** Your role is to act as a strict semantic verifier of reproducibility for pseudocode snippets, determining if each guarantees full correctness, termination, and robustness on every valid input scenario without external assumptions or failure modes. Return a precise reproducibility profile as a concatenated binary string, one digit per input snippet.
