Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a compact, high-level style with natural language, one-liners, symbolic operators, and abbreviations. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, or overview lines. Do not include comments or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Produce pseudocode that is clear and understandable, prioritizing brevity and structured steps. Your function has a 5-second timeout; generate the best possible output within this limit.
