Rewrite the given pseudocode into a semantically identical version that preserves all original function names, parameter names, class names, inheritance, interfaces, and class/object hierarchies exactly as they appear—do not modify or rename any of these.

Produce output pseudocode that implements exactly the same logic and behavior with zero change in observable effects or side effects, but that differs as extensively as possible from the original in *all other respects*, including but not limited to variable names, control flow structure, expression style, data organization, formatting, and code organization.

To maximize structural, syntactic, and stylistic divergence while preserving correctness, apply extensive and systematic transformations drawn from, but not limited to, the following dimensions:

1. **Control Flow Recomposition:**  
   - Replace loops with equivalent constructs: switch between FOR, WHILE, RECURSION (including tail and mutual recursion), or unroll loops when appropriate.  
   - Rewrite conditional statements by employing alternative logical groupings: transform IF-ELSE chains to SWITCH/CASE, nested IFs, guard clauses, boolean flags controlling flow, or condition inversions.  
   - Reorder independent code blocks and statements where data dependencies allow; introduce or remove nested blocks, sentinel conditions, or early exits while preserving original semantics.

2. **Local Identifier Renaming:**  
   - Rename all local variables, temporary variables, loop counters, and local parameters to new, meaningful, consistent identifiers that bear no resemblance to the original names.  
   - Ensure full renaming consistency across the pseudocode without changing function or class signatures.

3. **Expression and Predicate Reformulation:**  
   - Apply comprehensive Boolean algebra transformations (De Morgan’s laws, distribution, absorption, negation) on all logical conditions.  
   - Transform arithmetic expressions using equivalent algebraic forms, expansions, factorizations, or by replacing literals with computations yielding the same values.  
   - Extract and introduce well-named helper variables to replace complex or repeated sub-expressions.  
   - Change expression notation style if permissible (e.g., infix to prefix/postfix/functional).

4. **Data Structure and Access Strategy Modification:**  
   - Substitute data structures where semantically equivalent (e.g., array ↔ list ↔ linked list ↔ stack ↔ queue ↔ set) while maintaining full behavior.  
   - Convert data population and consumption approaches, such as from comprehensions to explicit loops or vice versa.  
   - Alter data initialization order, access patterns (index-based to iterator-based), and traversal sequences without semantic impact.

5. **Function and Module Restructuring:**  
   - Inline small functions or extract repetitive segments into fresh helper functions with unique names.  
   - Reorder functions or methods within classes or modules preserving all signatures, interrelations, and visibility.  
   - Modify parameter evaluation orders, invoke named arguments where allowed, without changing signatures or parameter names.

6. **Formatting, Keyword, and Naming Style Variation:**  
   - Change indentation, line breaks, spacing, keyword casing (upper/lower/title), and blank line usage extensively to maximize stylistic dissimilarity.  
   - Consistently replace keywords with valid synonyms supported by the pseudocode language (e.g., LET ↔ SET, CALL ↔ USE, IS ↔ EQUALS).  
   - Retain all comments, annotations, and documentation verbatim, without addition, omission, or modification.

7. **Strict Semantic and Structural Preservation Constraints:**  
   - Preserve class names, interface names, inheritance hierarchies, function names, and parameter names *exactly* as in the original.  
   - Do not add, remove, or modify any comments or explanatory texts embedded within the original pseudocode.  
   - Maintain 100% semantic equivalence, including side effects, output, and internal state.  
   - Use only language constructs and keywords valid in the original pseudocode style or clear semantic equivalents.  
   - All renamed internal identifiers (locals, indices, temporaries) must be distinct from original ones and renaming must be consistent throughout.
