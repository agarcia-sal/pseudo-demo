Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally identical version that differs as extensively as possible in all aspects of presentation, structure, and syntax—while strictly preserving the exact semantics and behavior. Maintain all original function names verbatim, along with all class names and their existing hierarchies, without any alteration. Your transformation should employ a broad spectrum of techniques, including but not limited to:

- Replacing control flow constructs (e.g., transform FOR loops into WHILE loops, substitute loops with recursion, or vice versa)  
- Reordering logical expressions and conditional branches where semantics stay intact  
- Renaming local variables and parameters systematically to different meaningful identifiers  
- Varying data structure usage when possible (e.g., switch arrays for lists, change stack representations, modify heap implementation style)  
- Reformatting indentation, spacing, and line breaks arbitrarily  
- Expressing conditions and expressions equivalently but differently (e.g., change >= to NOT <, use De Morgan’s laws)  
- Altering the order of independent statements or blocks, as long as overall correctness is unaffected  
- Avoiding any reuse of original code phrasing or syntax patterns wherever feasible without sacrificing clarity or correctness

Do not change or remove any original class or function signatures or their relative nesting. Do not add comments, explanations, or any content other than the rewritten pseudocode itself. The output must be only the newly rewritten pseudocode text.
