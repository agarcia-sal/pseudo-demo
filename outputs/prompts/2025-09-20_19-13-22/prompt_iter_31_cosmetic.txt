Rewrite the given pseudocode into a semantically identical version that preserves all **original class names, function names, method signatures, parameter names, and class/object hierarchies exactly as in the input**—no changes to any of these are allowed.

Your output pseudocode must implement the **exact same logic, guarantee identical behavior and side effects, and produce the same outputs** in all cases. 

However, transform everything else as extensively and systematically as possible to maximize divergence from the input pseudocode, by applying a rich combination of the following advanced, comprehensive rewriting strategies:

1. **Control Flow Overhaul:**  
   - Replace all loops with different, semantically equivalent looping constructs (FOR ↔ WHILE ↔ DO-WHILE ↔ RECURSION, including tail and mutual recursion), wherever the language semantics permit.  
   - Reexpress conditional logic between IF, ELSE IF, ELSE chains and SWITCH/CASE constructs or nested guard clauses; invert or reorder logical condition components using Boolean algebra.  
   - Restructure code blocks by flattening nested blocks or deeply nesting flat blocks, while preserving execution order and dependencies strictly.  
   - Introduce and utilize auxiliary sentinel or flag variables to control flow instead of direct conditions, or vice versa.  
   - Decompose or combine complex conditional expressions into smaller or larger subexpressions with helper variables, and invert condition tests rigorously.

2. **Rich Identifier Renaming:**  
   - Change all local variables, temporary variables, loop indices, and internal helpers to freshly generated, consistent, and meaningful names **that do not overlap or resemble original local identifiers** in spelling or style.  
   - Do **not** rename or modify any class names, function names, or parameters—these must stay exactly as in the input, including casing and spelling.  
   - Any newly introduced helper functions or procedures must have unique, descriptive names not used in the input, while maintaining original function signatures intact.

3. **Expression and Logical Reformulation:**  
   - Rewrite all arithmetic expressions to use mathematically equivalent forms: factorization, expansion, distributive transformations, substituted computations instead of literals (e.g., `4` as `2 * 2`, or `x - y` as `x + (-y)`).  
   - Apply Boolean algebra transformations exhaustively on all logical operators including De Morgan’s laws, distribution, absorption, duality, and negation identities on every condition.  
   - Replace infix expressions to prefix, postfix, or functional call forms if the language style allows, or combine/separate chained expressions.  
   - Extract common or repeated subexpressions into well-named temporary variables to increase structural variance.

4. **Data Structure and Access Style Reconfiguration:**  
   - Swap data structures to equivalent alternatives (arrays ↔ lists ↔ linked lists ↔ stacks ↔ queues ↔ sets), ensuring semantic behavior and interface compatibility is perfectly preserved.  
   - Translate implicit data constructs (list/set comprehensions, map/filter operations) into explicit loops and vice versa, depending on the input style.  
   - Change iteration order when commutative, or restructure indexing by remapping indices (e.g., reverse indexing), always preserving semantics.  
   - Modify initialization and mutation sequences of data containers to alternative but functionally equivalent orders.

5. **Architectural and Modular Reorganization:**  
   - Inline small helper functions into callers or extract repeated code blocks into new helper routines with fresh, descriptive names.  
   - Rearrange the ordering and nesting hierarchy of functions and methods inside classes or modules freely, while keeping all signatures exactly as in input.  
   - Use named arguments or reorder parameter evaluation sequences internally (if supported), without changing function interfaces externally.  
   - Refactor calls to use alternate valid calling styles (e.g., functional call vs. method call) where language style permits.

6. **Diverse and Drastic Formatting and Stylistic Variation:**  
   - Apply maximal diversity in formatting: use inconsistent but valid indentation levels, alter casing of language keywords, vary line breaks aggressively, add or remove blank lines arbitrarily.  
   - Systematically replace keywords with permitted synonyms or near-synonyms in the pseudocode language (e.g., USE instead of CALL, LET instead of SET, IS instead of EQUALS), consistently throughout.  
   - Preserve **all original comments, docstrings, and annotations verbatim and in their exact places without alteration or omission.**

7. **Absolute Semantic and Structural Fidelity:**  
   - Preserve all class and interface declarations, inheritance relations, function/method signatures, and parameter names exactly and without exception.  
   - Retain all comments, annotations, and explanatory texts embedded anywhere in the input as-is, no removals or additions.  
   - Guarantee 100% behavioral, semantic, and side-effect equivalence under all circumstances.  
   - Use only language constructs and keywords permitted in the original pseudocode or their exact semantic equivalents.  
   - All newly renamed identifiers must be globally consistent and completely distinct from original names.

**Final output: ONLY the rewritten pseudocode conforming to these instructions, with no additional explanation, commentary, or notes.**
