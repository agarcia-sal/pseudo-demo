Rewrite the provided pseudocode to yield a version that is fully equivalent in all behavior but deliberately transformed to be syntactically, structurally, and stylistically maximally distinct from the original. This includes, but is not limited to, reordering logic and conditions where semantics allow, substituting control flow constructs (e.g., loops â†” recursion, swapping FOR and WHILE loops), refactoring data structures and access patterns, renaming all variables and local identifiers while preserving original function and class names verbatim, altering the arrangement and indentation style, expressing operations and expressions differently (e.g., using equivalent arithmetic or boolean transformations), and varying code organization and modularization. Do not introduce any new functionality, remove existing functionality, or change class or function names or their nesting. Output only the rewritten pseudocode exactly, with no explanations, comments, annotations, or any other content.
