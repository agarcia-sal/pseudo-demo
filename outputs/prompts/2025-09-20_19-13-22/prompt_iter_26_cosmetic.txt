Rewrite the input pseudocode into a functionally identical version that strictly preserves all original function names, parameter names, class names, interfaces, and the exact class/object hierarchies without any modification.

Your output pseudocode must implement the exact same logic and produce the exact same observable behavior as the input, but must differ as much as possible from the original in every other aspect—maximizing syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence.

To do this, systematically and thoroughly apply a diverse set of transformations including but not limited to the following categories:

1. **Control Flow Reengineering:**  
   - Substitute between loop constructs (FOR ↔ WHILE ↔ RECURSION, including mutual and tail recursion) wherever semantically valid.  
   - Replace linear conditional chains (IF-ELSE or ELSE IF) with SWITCH/CASE, nested conditionals, early-exit guard clauses, combined conditions, or boolean flag-driven control flows.  
   - Rearrange logically independent code blocks and statements; flatten or add nested blocks while preserving execution order dependencies.  
   - Introduce sentinel or guard variables to drive loop progression and branching conditions.  
   - Decompose complex conditions into simpler parts with helper variables or invert logic using Boolean algebra.

2. **Complete Local Variable Renaming:**  
   - Rename all local, temporary, and parameter variables to fresh, meaningful, and consistent identifiers distinct from anything in the original code.  
   - Keep the original function and class names unchanged, but all other identifiers (locals, loop indices, temporaries) must be reinvented fully without reuse.

3. **Expressions and Conditions Transformation:**  
   - Rewrite all logical expressions using Boolean algebra transformations (De Morgan’s laws, distributive, associative, absorption, negation identities).  
   - Change arithmetic expressions using equivalent identities, factoring, expansion, or replacing literals with calculated expressions.  
   - Introduce well-named helper variables for sub-expressions and repeated computations to improve structural difference.  
   - Convert expression notation styles: infix to prefix, postfix, or explicit functional forms as allowed in pseudocode.

4. **Data Structures and Access Pattern Remodeling:**  
   - Substitute between semantically equivalent data structures (e.g., arrays, lists, linked lists, sets, queues, stacks), ensuring behavior is intact.  
   - Convert list comprehensions or comprehensions into explicit loops, and vice versa, where supported.  
   - Change data initialization style and access orders, including index transformations or iterator usage.  
   - Modify data population and consumption sequences without altering semantic meaning.

5. **Function and Module Architectural Reforms:**  
   - Inline short functions or extract repeated code fragments into new uniquely named helper functions.  
   - Change the order and nesting of functions and methods inside classes or modules without changing signatures.  
   - Use named argument calls if syntax allows, but do not modify parameter names or counts.  
   - Restructure parameter evaluation order (while preserving calling conventions and signatures).

6. **Formatting and Styling Variation:**  
   - Vary indentation levels, line breaks, use of blank lines, keyword casing (upper/lower/title case), spacing, and formatting styles extensively to maximize visual discrepancy.  
   - Where synonyms exist in the pseudocode language, replace keywords consistently (e.g., USE instead of CALL, LET instead of SET, IS instead of EQUALS).  
   - Keep all comments, annotations, and explanatory texts exactly as in the original—do not remove, add, or alter comments or docstrings.

7. **Structural and Semantic Integrity Constraints:**  
   - Preserve class names, interfaces, inheritance hierarchies, and function/method signatures exactly, without modification.  
   - Keep original function and parameter names exactly as they appear.  
   - Absolutely no addition, removal, or alteration of comments or explanatory texts embedded in the input pseudocode.  
   - Maintain 100% semantic equivalence, ensuring all original behaviors, side effects, and outputs remain identical.  
   - Use only constructs and keywords valid and allowed in the original pseudocode language style or their exact semantic equivalents.  
   - All renamed local/internal identifiers must be consistently renamed and completely distinct from original ones.
