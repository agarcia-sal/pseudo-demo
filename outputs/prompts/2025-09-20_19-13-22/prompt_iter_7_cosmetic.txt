Rewrite the provided pseudocode so that the output is a functionally identical but maximally transformed version from the input. Maintain the exact original function names, class names, and class/object hierarchies without alteration. Aside from these, apply extensive and varied modifications in syntax, semantics, and structure, including but not limited to:

- Systematic and consistent renaming of all non-function/class identifiers (variables, parameters, and internal symbols)
- Replacing all loop constructs with alternative forms (e.g., FOR to WHILE or recursion, or vice versa)
- Reordering logically independent statements and expressions as permissible
- Changing expression forms while preserving exact computations (e.g., use different arithmetic factorizations or conditional expressions)
- Modifying control flow structures (swap IF-ELSE with SWITCH or nested conditions, invert conditions consistently, or use early returns)
- Refactoring nested blocks to flatten or increase depth, as long as behavior is preserved
- Altering formatting extensively, including whitespace, indentation, and line breaks
- Substituting built-in operations with equivalent descriptions or alternative idioms where allowed in pseudocode
- Rearranging declaration locations and combining or splitting statements

Do not introduce any additional explanations, comments, logging, or narrative. Only provide the rewritten pseudocode as plain text output.

The correctness of the transformation depends on preserving all original logic and semantics exactly, only the syntax and structure should diverge as much as possible.

Output only the transformed pseudocode.
