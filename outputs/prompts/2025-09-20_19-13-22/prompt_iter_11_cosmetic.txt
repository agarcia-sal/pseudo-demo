Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a *functionally identical* but *syntactically and structurally distinct* version adhering to the following constraints:

- Preserve **all behavior and logic exactly**; the rewritten pseudocode must produce the same outputs and side effects on all inputs.
- Keep **all function and method names unchanged**, as well as **all class names and their original inheritance, composition, and object hierarchies intact**.
- Transform control flow by freely replacing loop types (e.g., `FOR` ↔ `WHILE` ↔ recursion), conditionals, and branching structures.
- Rename **all local variables and parameters consistently** to new, unique identifiers unrelated to the originals.
- Change the order of equivalent expressions and statements where semantics allow.
- Replace data structure operations and intermediates with alternative, semantically equivalent forms.
- Reformat indentation, whitespace, and line-breaking in novel ways.
- Reorganize code blocks, splitting, merging, or reordering statements as long as semantic equivalence is guaranteed.
- Avoid adding comments, explanations, or any content beyond the rewritten pseudocode itself.
- Produce only the rewritten pseudocode as output, no extra text.

This prompt is to be applied *generically* on any input pseudocode to maximize diversity while maintaining exact functional equivalence and preserving all original class/function names and structures.
