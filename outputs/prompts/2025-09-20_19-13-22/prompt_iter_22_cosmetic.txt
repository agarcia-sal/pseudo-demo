Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally identical version that **preserves exactly all original function names, parameter names, class names, and the entire class/object hierarchy without any change**. It is critical that the output pseudocode retains the same interface and structural organization as the input.

Your goal is to maximize dissimilarity with the input pseudocode by aggressively transforming all other aspects of the code (syntax, control flow, variable names, formatting, and expressions) **while guaranteeing perfect semantic equivalence and reproducibility**.

Apply a broad, diverse set of transformations as thoroughly as possible, including but not limited to:

- Replace all variable names (locals, temporaries, loop indices) with fresh, meaningful but completely unrelated names. Ensure *none* of the original variable names appear anywhere in the output.
- Rewrite all control constructs into different logical equivalents—e.g., convert FOR loops into WHILE loops or recursion; change IF-ELSE chains into nested IF, SWITCH, or guard clauses; inline/extract helper functions wherever possible while preserving interface.
- Transform all Boolean and conditional expressions via sound logical equivalences (De Morgan’s laws, contrapositives, distribution, short-circuit rearrangements, condition factoring) and introduce named intermediate variables if helpful.
- Vary all arithmetic and literal expressions by replacing constants with equivalent computed forms and rearranging expressions using algebraic identities.
- Alter data structure usage while preserving semantics (e.g., replace arrays with linked lists, sets, queues where possible; expand comprehensions into explicit loops or fold loops into comprehensions if the original style allows).
- Reorder independent statements or logically separable blocks freely, provided output semantics remain unchanged.
- Intensely vary formatting: indentation, line breaks, keyword casing, whitespace, grouping of statements, and delimiters, to maximize textual difference.
- Flatten or nest code blocks differently; use early returns or guard clauses as alternatives to nested conditions; convert tail recursion into loops and vice versa.
- Maintain all comments, annotations, and explanatory notes *unchanged and exactly as in the input*, inserted at the original positions without any modification, addition, or removal.
- Do not add any constructs, syntax, or library calls that were not present or not strictly equivalent to those used in the input pseudocode language/style.

**Strict output requirements:**

- Output only the transformed pseudocode — no explanations, no reasoning, no extra text.
- Keep all original class and function/method signatures and hierarchies fully intact and identical.
- Do not omit, alter, or reorder function parameters or class definitions.
- Ensure the transformed pseudocode, when interpreted, implements precisely the same algorithm with identical behavior as the original, down to corner cases and control paths.
- Do not rename functions, methods, classes, or parameters — only local/internal variables and code structures.
- Avoid introducing any semantic or syntactic errors, such as out-of-bound accesses, infinite loops, or type inconsistencies not present in the original.

To summarize: produce an output pseudocode version as *syntactically and structurally distinct* as possible while *guaranteeing exact semantic equivalence and interface preservation*, preserving all comments verbatim, and respecting the pseudocode language constructs used in the original.

**Output format:** Only output the fully rewritten pseudocode text exactly per above; no additional content.
