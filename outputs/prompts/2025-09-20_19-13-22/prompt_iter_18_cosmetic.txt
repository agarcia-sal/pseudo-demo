Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a completely functionally equivalent alternative version that differs maximally from the original in every possible syntactic and structural aspect, including but not limited to control flow style (e.g., switch between recursion, iteration, and functional constructs), expression evaluation order, loop constructs (e.g., convert FOR loops to WHILE loops, or vice versa), condition style, variable naming, inlining or extraction of helper logic, and formatting conventions. Preserve exactly all original function names, class names, and their class/object hierarchies without any change. Do not alter the semantics or functionality in any way. Your output must contain only the rewritten pseudocode itselfâ€”no explanations, no comments, no additional text.
