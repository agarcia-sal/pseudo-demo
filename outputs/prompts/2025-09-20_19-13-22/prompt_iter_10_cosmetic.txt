Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally identical version that differs as radically as possible in all aspects of syntax, formatting, and structureâ€”while strictly preserving every behavior and logic detail. Maintain **all original function names exactly**, and **preserve all class names along with their original class/object hierarchies exactly**.  
To maximize dissimilarity:  
- Use alternative control flow paradigms (e.g., convert loops to recursion or vice versa, switch between different loop styles)  
- Rename all local variables completely differently (no reuse of original variable names)  
- Reorganize and restructure code blocks and expressions non-trivially (including reordering independent statements when possible)  
- Replace common idioms with semantically equivalent but uncommon or more verbose constructs  
- Vary expression grouping, operator usage, and literal formatting (e.g., use arithmetic identities, negations, or decompositions)  
- Adjust indentation, whitespace style, and line breaks extensively  
- Avoid using shortcuts or built-in functions if the original uses them; instead, expand their logic manually, and vice versa  

Do **not** alter function or class signatures, nor add or remove any output, comments, explanations, or annotations. The output must contain only the rewritten pseudocode itself, fully complete and self-contained.  

Your goal is to produce a fresh, maximally diversified pseudocode rendition that is impossible to confuse with the original by style or structure, yet guarantees precise equivalence in all functionality. Output nothing besides this pseudocode.
