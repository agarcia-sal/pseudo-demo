Rewrite the provided pseudocode to produce a version that is semantically identical but syntactically, structurally, and stylistically as distinct as possible from the input. You must strictly preserve **all original function names, class names, and class/object hierarchies exactly**, without any renaming or reorganization of classes or nesting. However, you are free to rename all local variables and parameters arbitrarily wherever allowed.

Specifically, to maximize difference:

- Change control flow constructs freely: convert FOR loops to WHILE loops or recursion; replace WHILE loops with FOR loops; use alternative iteration techniques.
- Rearrange expressions and reorder computations without changing logic or output.
- Substitute conditional styles (e.g., invert conditions, use guard clauses, switch/case instead of if-else, or vice versa).
- Use different data traversal methods (e.g., index-based loops vs. iterators).
- Modify formatting extensively: indentation style, line breaks, spacing, parentheses usage, and comments removal.
- Rewrite arithmetic and logical expressions using equivalent but different forms.
- Replace repeated patterns with helper functions or inline expansions, as fits best for difference.
- Avoid introducing any new behavior, additional features, or explanatory comments.
- Only preserve the original semantics and interfaces precisely, without omissions or additions.

**Output only the rewritten pseudocodeâ€”no explanations, no extra text, no commentary.** The output must be valid pseudocode that, when interpreted or implemented, behaves identically to the original, uses the same APIs and signatures, and keeps class and function names unchanged, but otherwise differs greatly in appearance and style.
