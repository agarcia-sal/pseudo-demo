Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally equivalent yet maximally dissimilar version, adhering strictly to the following directives:

- **Preserve exactly all original class names, their inheritance and interface relationships, all function/method names, and their parameter names and order, along with the full class, module, or object hierarchies.**  
- **Maintain complete semantic equivalence: the new pseudocode must implement the identical behavior and logic of the original without any functional changes.**  
- **Do not add, remove, or modify any comments, annotations, or explanatory texts present in the input pseudocode. Preserve their exact content and placement.**  
- **Only output rewritten pseudocode; no explanations or additional text.**

To maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence, apply diverse and systematic transformations from the following (but not limited to):

1. **Control Flow Transformation:**  
   - Convert loops among FOR, WHILE, REPEAT-UNTIL, tail recursion, or mutually recursive forms.  
   - Replace conditional constructs (IF-ELSE, SWITCH-CASE, pattern matching, guard clauses) with alternative but logically equivalent structures.  
   - Rearrange statements and independent code blocks wherever reordering does not compromise correctness. Flatten or increase nested block depths appropriately.  
   - Introduce or eliminate early returns and sentinel/flag variables for loop and decision control.

2. **Variable Renaming:**  
   - Rename all variable identifiers (locals, parameters, temporaries) consistently to new, meaningful, unrelated identifiers not appearing anywhere in the original input. Preserve exact parameter names for functions and methods, but local variables must be re-named.  
   - Ensure no original local variable names or aliases appear in any form.

3. **Expression and Condition Rewriting:**  
   - Rewrite all logical, arithmetic, and relational expressions applying Boolean algebra identities (De Morgan, distribution, absorption), arithmetic transformations (expansion, factoring), and equivalent but alternative expression forms.  
   - Substitute direct literal constants with equivalent calculations, expressions, symbolic forms, or named helper variables where suitable.  
   - Use prefix, postfix, or infix notation interchangeably where the original pseudocode style allows, ensuring semantic equivalence.

4. **Data Structure Reformulation:**  
   - Replace data structures with semantically equivalent alternatives (e.g., arrays â†” linked lists, sets, queues, maps) without altering their usage logic.  
   - Expand syntactic shorthand such as comprehensions or iterators into explicit loops, or vice versa depending on original style, maximizing divergence.  
   - Transform data initialization and access patterns consistently.

5. **Function and Code Organization:**  
   - Inline function bodies into callers or extract repeated statements into new helper functions with unique names while preserving all original function/method signatures and parameter lists exactly.  
   - Change function order within classes or modules arbitrarily. Alter nesting hierarchy of functions but keep original signatures.  
   - Use named or positional arguments interchangeably only if the original pseudocode language allows, without changing parameter names.

6. **Stylistic and Formatting Variations:**  
   - Apply extensive reformatting: alternate indentation levels, line breaks, spacing, capitalization of keywords, and line wrapping styles.  
   - Substitute keywords with exact synonyms if the pseudocode language supports them (e.g., LET for SET, IS instead of EQUALS). Use each synonym consistently throughout.  
   - Do not reorder or alter comment content, and preserve their positions exactly.

**Strict constraints to enforce:**

- Do not add, remove, or alter comments or non-code annotations; output only pseudocode lines as rewritten.  
- Retain the exact function/method and class names and their parameter names and counts without change.  
- Maintain exact class inheritance and interface relationships as in the original.  
- The output must be parseable pseudocode in the style of the input, using only supported constructs.  
- Semantic equivalence must be 100% guaranteed.  
- All renamed variables must be new and consistent throughout the rewriting.  
- Do not output anything other than the transformed pseudocode.

**Output format:** Only the rewritten pseudocode code block corresponding to the input pseudocode. No additional explanations or text.

This prompt targets maximum practical syntactic, structural, and stylistic diversity from the original pseudocode while perfectly preserving semantics, class and function signatures, and providing consistent variable renaming and varied expression rewriting.
