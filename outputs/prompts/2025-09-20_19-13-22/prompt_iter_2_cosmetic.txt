Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally equivalent version that is maximally dissimilar in syntax, formatting, and structural organization from the original, while strictly preserving all behavior. Retain all original function names exactly, as well as all class names and their original class and object hierarchies exactly. Employ diverse programming constructs, alternative control flow styles (e.g., replacing FOR loops with WHILE loops or recursion), variable renaming, different expression orderings, and varied formatting to maximize difference without altering semantics. Do not add explanations, annotations, or any content other than the rewritten pseudocode itself. Output only the pseudocode.
