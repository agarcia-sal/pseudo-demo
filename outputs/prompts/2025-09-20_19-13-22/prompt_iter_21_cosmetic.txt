Rewrite the input pseudocode into a semantically identical pseudocode version that preserves all original **function names, parameter names, class names, and the exact class/object hierarchy and interfaces** without alteration.

Your output must:

- Fully **retain all original behaviors** and side effects exactly, producing the same outcomes for all inputs.
- Output only the rewritten pseudocode—**do not include any comments, explanations, or annotations**.
- Maintain all original function and method signatures exactly (names and parameter lists unchanged).
- Keep class and object structures exactly as given—do NOT add or remove classes, inheritances, or interfaces.

To achieve maximal syntactic and structural difference from the original pseudocode while preserving exact semantics, apply extensive and varied transformations, including but not limited to:

- Convert control structures into alternative logically equivalent forms: e.g., replace all FOR loops by WHILE loops or recursion; transform IF, IF-ELSE, or nested conditionals into alternative arrangements like SWITCH or early-exit guard clauses.
- Rename **all variables (local, temporary, loop counters, parameters)** to new meaningful identifiers unrelated to originals, ensuring **no original variable name appears** in the output.
- Systematically apply logical equivalences and Boolean algebra to rewrite all conditional expressions and logical operations (e.g., use De Morgan’s Laws, distributive laws, canonical forms), introducing intermediate variables as needed.
- Re-express arithmetic and constant values by equivalent formulas or derived expressions rather than literals.
- Change data representation styles: convert arrays to linked lists or other equivalent structures, or vice versa; expand list comprehensions or syntactic sugar into explicit loops and conditionals, or introduce them where appropriate.
- Inline small functions or extract repeated code blocks into new helper functions within the same class/namespace, rearranging function nesting and ordering—but **do not change or remove existing function signatures**.
- Alter parameter usage ordering if the language allows named/keyword arguments, as long as the signature (names and count) is unmodified.
- Reorder any independent statements or logically separable code blocks, avoiding any changes to execution semantics.
- Change formatting extensively: indentation style, line breaks, casing of keywords, spacing, and block grouping.
- Flatten or nest blocks differently, introduce early returns or continue statements as substitutes, or rewrite loops as tail recursion, and vice versa.
- Rename any user-defined types or helper identifiers within the methods if any, so long as class and interface names remain fixed.

**Hard Constraints:**

- Do NOT remove, add, or modify any comments or documentation lines—simply reproduce them exactly.
- Do NOT change or introduce constructs unsupported by the original pseudocode language.
- Every transformation must strictly preserve the original behavior on all inputs.
- Generate output pseudocode only; no explanations, no meta-discussion.

**Output format:** Provide only the fully rewritten, functionally equivalent pseudocode, conforming precisely to the above rules.

Given these rigorous requirements, produce the maximal possible syntactic and structural divergence from the input pseudocode, while guaranteeing perfect functional equivalence and total preservation of all original function/class names, interfaces, and overall program architecture.
