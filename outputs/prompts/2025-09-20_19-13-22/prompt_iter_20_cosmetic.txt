Rewrite the input pseudocode to produce a functionally equivalent pseudocode version that **strictly preserves all original semantics, including exact function names, parameter names, class names, and the original class/object hierarchies and interfaces**.

Your goal is to generate pseudocode that differs as much as possible in syntax, structure, and expression from the input while maintaining all behaviors exactly.

To achieve maximal syntactic and structural divergence, apply a diverse and comprehensive set of transformations, including but not limited to:

- Convert control flow constructs into alternate logically equivalent forms (e.g., transform FOR loops into WHILE loops, recursion, or tail-recursion; replace IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH statements, nested conditionals, or guard clauses).
- Reorder any independent statements, reorder code blocks or logically separable sections without changing semantics.
- Consistently rename all variables (local, parameters, and temporaries) to meaningful but completely distinct names; **no original variable names should appear** anywhere in the output.
- Systematically rewrite all conditions and logical expressions by applying Boolean algebra transformations (De Morgan’s laws, logical equivalences, condition simplifications, canonization, short-circuiting rearrangements) and introduce helper variables where appropriate.
- Change expression formats: replace literal constants with equivalent calculated expressions or symbolic constants; modify arithmetic expressions keeping mathematical equivalence.
- Restructure data organization: replace arrays with equivalent data structures (linked lists, queues, sets) where semantics remain consistent; convert list comprehensions or syntactic sugar into explicit iterative constructs, or vice versa.
- Inline functions or extract code blocks into new helper functions, reorganizing function layout, ordering, and nesting as long as interface definitions remain intact.
- Alter parameter usage: reorder parameters or switch to named arguments if the pseudocode style permits, keeping signatures identical in name and arity.
- Vary formatting extensively: indentation styles, spacing, line breaks, keyword casing, and grouping to maximize visual differences.
- Apply alternative structural logical grouping or lexical transformations (e.g., flatten nested blocks, introduce early returns or guard clauses, replace loops with recursion and vice versa).

**Strict Constraints:**

- Do NOT add, remove, or modify any comments, annotations, or explanatory text – output **only** the rewritten pseudocode.
- Preserve all original function and method signatures fully unchanged (names and parameter names).
- Preserve all original class and object hierarchy structures with identical names.
- Preserve behavior perfectly: the code must be semantically equivalent.
- Avoid any pseudocode constructs or library calls that do not appear in or are not equivalent to constructs used or permitted by the original pseudocode language style.

**Output format:** Just the final rewritten pseudocode according to the rules above, no explanations or additional outputs.

Given these guidelines, produce a maximally transformed, yet perfectly equivalent, version of the input pseudocode.
