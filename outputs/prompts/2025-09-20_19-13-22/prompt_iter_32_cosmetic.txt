Rewrite the given pseudocode into a new version that is functionally and behaviorally identical in every respect—including all outputs, side effects, and semantics—while maximizing syntactic, structural, and stylistic disparity. 

**Strictly preserve without any changes:**  
- All class names, interfaces, inheritance hierarchies, and their nesting.  
- All function and method names, parameter names, and signatures.  
- All original comments, annotations, and explanatory texts exactly as they appear (no additions, removals, or edits).  
- The exact class/object and module organization and hierarchy.

**Transform everything else as extensively as possible, employing diverse and combined approaches including but not limited to:**  

1. **Control Flow & Logic Restructuring:**  
 - Replace all loops (FOR, WHILE) with alternative forms including recursion (tail or mutual) and vice versa, whenever semantics allow.  
 - Transform conditional statements: swap IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH/CASE, nested IFs, guard clauses, boolean flags, or combined conditions.  
 - Break down or merge complex conditions using Boolean algebra, De Morgan’s laws, or helper boolean variables.  
 - Reorder independent code blocks, add or flatten nesting levels without affecting execution order or logic.

2. **Identifier Renaming:**  
 - Rename every local, temporary, and helper variable to fresh, semantically meaningful, consistent identifiers that do not overlap with any original identifiers.  
 - Maintain original function, method, class, interface, and parameter names exactly.  
 - Ensure all new local names are unique and consistently used.

3. **Expressions and Arithmetic Variations:**  
 - Rewrite all logical and arithmetic expressions using equivalent transformations (factoring, expansion, identities, negations, distributive and associative laws).  
 - Replace literals with expressions (e.g., 4 as 2*2 or (8/2)) or equivalent constants.  
 - Introduce intermediate helper variables to hold sub-expressions and repeated calculations, increasing difference.  
 - Vary expression forms—e.g., infix, prefix, postfix, or explicit calls to operations—where pseudocode semantics permit.

4. **Data Structure Substitutions and Access Modifications:**  
 - Replace data structures with semantically equivalent alternatives (arrays ↔ lists ↔ linked lists ↔ stacks ↔ queues ↔ sets), ensuring behavior is strictly preserved.  
 - Re-express list comprehensions as explicit loops and vice versa wherever valid.  
 - Change data initialization styles, iterate via indices or iterators interchangeably.  
 - Alter data processing sequences and access patterns without modifying semantics.

5. **Function and Module Architecture Modification:**  
 - Inline short functions or extract repeated code into new uniquely named helper functions, respecting original signatures.  
 - Reorder and re-nest functions/methods inside classes or modules without changing their signatures or visibility.  
 - Use named or positional argument calls interchangeably, keeping parameter names unchanged.  
 - Change parameter evaluation order and argument passing style while preserving interface.

6. **Styling, Formatting, and Keyword Variation:**  
 - Vary indentation, line breaks, blank lines, and spacing extensively to maximize visual difference.  
 - Use consistent alternative keywords and casing (e.g., LET instead of SET, IS instead of EQUALS, upper/lower/title case variants), restricted to valid pseudocode synonyms.  
 - Preserve all original comments verbatim, maintaining their position relative to code.

7. **Semantic and Structural Integrity Enforcement:**  
 - Under no circumstance alter or remove original comments or docstrings.  
 - Produce output exclusively in the pseudocode style and constructs demonstrated in the input; no foreign syntax or language features are allowed.  
 - The output pseudocode must be semantically equivalent and produce identical observable results for all inputs.

**Your output must be solely the fully rewritten pseudocode adhering strictly to these rules, without any explanatory text, commentary, or metadata.**
