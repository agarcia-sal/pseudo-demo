Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that is functionally *identical* in every respect—preserving **all class names, function names, method signatures, parameter names, and exact class/interface hierarchies without any alterations**—but which differs as much as possible from the original in **every other aspect**. Your output should contain **only** this rewritten pseudocode, with no explanations or comments.

To maximize the difference while maintaining exact behavior, systematically and comprehensively apply a wide variety of transformations, including but not limited to the following, and combine them liberally:

1. **Control Flow Diversification:**  
 - Replace loops with recursion, tail recursion, or mutually recursive functions where valid.  
 - Convert between loop types (FOR ↔ WHILE ↔ REPEAT-UNTIL) where semantics allow.  
 - Transform linear IF-ELSE chains into SWITCH/CASE constructs, nested conditionals, guard clauses, ternary logic, or Boolean flag-driven flows.  
 - Split, merge, reorder, or nest code blocks extensively, preserving dependency order but maximizing structural difference.  
 - Introduce sentinel or state variables to control looping and branching instead of direct conditionals.  
 - Decompose complex logical conditions into smaller parts using helper variables and invert or reformulate them using Boolean algebra rules.

2. **Identifier Renaming Strategy:**  
 - Keep all class, interface, function, and parameter names strictly identical; these must remain exactly as in the input.  
 - Rename *all other* identifiers (local variables, loop indices, temporary variables, helper variables) to entirely fresh, meaningful, and internally consistent names that bear no resemblance to the original identifiers.  
 - Ensure renamed locals do not shadow or clash with original names or each other; be consistent throughout.

3. **Expression and Operation Reformulation:**  
 - Rewrite all logical expressions using equivalent forms derived from Boolean algebra (e.g., De Morgan’s laws, distribution, absorption, negations).  
 - Replace arithmetic expressions by equivalent transformed expressions (e.g., expansions, factoring, transformed constants to computed forms).  
 - Introduce named helper variables for repeated sub-expressions or parts of complex expressions to improve structural difference.  
 - Vary notation: interchange infix, prefix, postfix, or fully functional styles allowed by the pseudocode language.  
 - Swap equivalent data or control operations using allowed synonyms or semantic equivalents.

4. **Data Structure and Access Changes:**  
 - Swap semantically equivalent data structures (arrays, lists, sets, queues, stacks, linked lists) preserving behavior exactly.  
 - Convert between data comprehensions and explicit loops where supported, or vice versa.  
 - Change data initialization styles, population order, and access patterns (e.g., indices reversed or mapped) without changing semantics.  
 - Adjust the way data is iterated, consumed, or duplicated to maximize discrepancy.

5. **Function and Modular Refinements:**  
 - Inline small functions or extract repeated code fragments into new uniquely named helper functions/methods, ensuring new function names differ from any identifiers in original code.  
 - Reorder or nest function and method definitions differently inside classes or modules without changing signatures or visibility.  
 - Change calling syntax using named parameters or reordered evaluation order if supported, without renaming parameters or changing function signatures.  
 - Use different but semantically equivalent calling conventions or patterns where possible.

6. **Stylistic and Formatting Variation:**  
 - Vary indentation (spaces/tabs/levels), line breaks, whitespace, and blank line placement arbitrarily for maximal visual difference.  
 - Change keyword casing (e.g., upper, lower, title case) or replace keywords with valid language synonyms consistently (e.g., LET vs SET, IS vs EQUALS).  
 - Rearrange comments or annotations only if allowed *without adding, removing, or editing* them; otherwise preserve all comments exactly as is.  
 - Use different but semantically equivalent delimiters, punctuation, or grouping styles allowed by the pseudocode language.

7. **Strict Semantic and Structural Integrity:**  
 - Do not add, remove, or modify any comments, docstrings, annotations, or explanatory text.  
 - Do not change any class names, interface names, function/method names, or parameter names/signatures.  
 - Do not alter the exact class/object inheritance or implementation hierarchies.  
 - Maintain 100% semantic equivalence, including side effects, outputs, and observable behavior.  
 - Use only constructs and keywords valid in the input language or their exact semantic equivalents.  
 - Ensure all renamed locals are consistently distinct from the original identifiers and from each other throughout the code.
