Rewrite the given input pseudocode by producing a version that is maximally and systematically different from the original in all syntactic, structural, and stylistic aspects, while strictly maintaining **all** original:

- Class names, class hierarchies, interfaces, and their nesting/organization  
- Function and method names  
- Parameter names and their order/count  
- Comments, annotations, and all explanatory texts exactly as provided (no additions, removals, or edits)  

Your rewritten pseudocode must implement **identical** logic and yield **exactly** the same observable behavior as the input, including side effects and output values, without exception.

To maximize divergence, apply a broad, comprehensive, and combinatorial range of transformations across these dimensions:

1. **Control Flow Restructuring:**  
   - Convert loops to semantically equivalent alternatives (FOR ↔ WHILE ↔ tail or mutual RECURSION), carefully preserving semantics and avoiding infinite recursion.  
   - Replace IF-ELSE/ELSE-IF chains with SWITCH/CASE, boolean flags with guard clauses, nested conditionals, or flattened logical constructs.  
   - Reorder independent statement blocks and introduce additional nested blocks or flatten nested ones where semantics allow.  
   - Replace complex conditionals with logically equivalent Boolean algebra forms, factoring or decomposing conditions using helper variables.  
   - Introduce sentinel/flag variables to control iterations and branching decisions transparently.  

2. **Systematic Local Identifier Renaming:**  
   - Fully rename every local variable, temporary, loop index, and helper variable to new, meaningful, consistent, and distinct identifiers that do not appear in the original.  
   - Keep all function names and parameter names unchanged exactly to ensure interface stability.  
   - Ensure renamed identifiers maintain consistent usage throughout the pseudocode.  

3. **Expressions and Logical Transformations:**  
   - Apply rigorous Boolean algebra transformations (use De Morgan’s Laws, distributive, associative, absorption, negations) to all conditions and logical expressions, rewriting equivalently.  
   - Re-express arithmetic computations by applying equivalent transformations including factoring, expanding, rearranging operators, or substituting expressions with computed equivalents (e.g., `x + 0` → `x`, or replace literals with equivalent calculations).  
   - Extract repeated or complex sub-expressions into well-named helper variables to increase structural difference.  
   - Change expression representations when valid in the pseudocode language: infix ↔ prefix ↔ postfix ↔ functional notation.  

4. **Data Representations and Access Patterns:**  
   - Substitute between semantically equal data structures (arrays, lists, linked lists, sets, stacks, queues), transforming initialization, iteration, and access patterns accordingly without affecting semantics.  
   - Alter iteration methods by replacing explicit loops with comprehensions, iterator-use, or vice versa where allowed.  
   - Change data insertion/access order, indexing schemes, and initialization style without modifying logical outcomes.  

5. **Function and Architectural Refactorings:**  
   - Inline short helper functions or, conversely, extract repeated code fragments into newly introduced uniquely named helper functions that preserve the original interfaces.  
   - Rearrange the order and nesting of functions/methods within classes or modules, preserving exact signatures and visibility.  
   - Where pseudocode syntax permits, use named arguments in function calls without altering parameter names or count.  
   - Modify parameter evaluation order tactically, preserving semantic call behavior but increasing structural variation.  

6. **Formatting, Styling, and Keyword Variants:**  
   - Drastically alter indentation, line breaks, blank lines, whitespace usage, keyword capitalization, and formatting style consistently throughout the code to maximize visual difference.  
   - Substitute keywords with valid language synonyms or equivalent constructs consistently (e.g., `LET` ↔ `SET`, `CALL` ↔ `USE`, `IS` ↔ `EQUALS`), only if officially valid in the pseudocode style.  
   - Preserve all original comments and docstrings verbatim in original locations, without alteration.  

7. **Strict Semantic and Structural Integrity:**  
   - **Class names, class structures, inheritance, and interfaces, as well as function and parameter names, must remain exactly as in the original code.**  
   - **Preserve all comments and explanatory texts unmodified.**  
   - Ensure that every renamed internal identifier is unique, consistent, and different from original names.  
   - Maintain total semantic equivalence: the rewritten pseudocode must replicate all computations, side effects, outputs, and observable behaviors exactly, without deviation.  
   - Use only valid pseudocode language constructs and keywords equal or equivalent to those in the input’s language style.

**Your output must be only the fully rewritten pseudocode following the above requirements exactly, with no additional explanations, commentary, or output beyond the pseudocode itself.**
