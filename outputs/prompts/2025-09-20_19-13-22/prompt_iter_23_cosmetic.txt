Rewrite the input pseudocode into a semantically identical version that **fully preserves all original function names, parameter names, class names, and the exact class/object hierarchies and interfaces** without any alteration.

Your rewritten pseudocode must implement exactly the same behavior as the original, but must appear as different as possible, maximizing divergence in all syntax, structure, and expression aspects while maintaining 100% semantic equivalence.

To achieve this, apply extensive, varied, and systematic transformations including but not limited to:

1. **Control flow refactoring:**  
   - Change loops between FOR, WHILE, and tail recursion or mutual recursion forms.  
   - Replace IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH/CASE, nested conditionals, guard clauses, early returns, or combined conditionals.  
   - Flatten or deepen nested blocks, reorder logically independent statements or code blocks wherever possible.  
   - Use boolean flags and sentinel values to restructure loops and conditions.

2. **Variable renaming:**  
   - Rename every variable (including locals, parameters, temporaries) consistently with distinct, meaningful names not appearing in the original code.  
   - Avoid any original variable identifiers anywhere in the output.

3. **Condition and expression rewriting:**  
   - Transform all logical and arithmetic expressions using Boolean algebra laws (De Morgan’s, distribution, absorption, double negation), arithmetic identities, and equivalent symbolic or computed forms.  
   - Introduce well-named helper variables for subexpressions.  
   - Replace literal constants with semantically equivalent computed or symbolic forms.  
   - Change expression styles: prefer prefix, postfix, or infix notation variants where valid in pseudocode style.

4. **Data structures and data access transformations:**  
   - Substitute arrays with equivalent collections (e.g., lists ↔ linked lists, sets, queues), as long as semantic meaning is intact.  
   - Transform syntactic sugar such as list comprehensions or comprehensions into explicit iteration, or vice versa.  
   - Restructure data initialization and access patterns.

5. **Function and code structuring:**  
   - Inline functions or extract code fragments into new helper functions with unique names; alter function order and nesting without modifying interface signatures.  
   - Reorder parameter usage via named arguments if supported, but keep exact parameter names and arity intact.  
   - Change order of functions inside classes or modules while preserving their original signatures.

6. **Stylistic and formatting variability:**  
   - Vary indentation, line breaks, spacing, casing of keywords, and formatting style heavily to maximize visual and syntactic difference.  
   - Reformat comments strictly *only* if they are part of the pseudocode code itself (do not add, remove, or modify comments/explanations).  
   - Use alternate but semantically equivalent keywords where applicable (e.g., IS instead of EQUALS, LET instead of SET), consistent within the rewritten code.

**Absolute constraints (must be strictly enforced):**

- **Do not** add, remove, or alter comments, annotations, or any explanatory texts embedded in the original pseudocode; output only rewritten pseudocode.  
- Preserve all original function and method signatures exactly (function/method names and parameter names).  
- Preserve the names of all classes and their hierarchical or interface relationships exactly as in the input.  
- Maintain 100% semantic equivalence, preserving all behaviors perfectly.  
- Use only pseudocode constructs, keywords, and library calls allowed in or equivalent to those in the original pseudocode language style; do not introduce unsupported constructs.  
- Ensure all renamed variables are distinct from original names and consistent throughout the transformed code.

---

**Output:** Provide only the fully rewritten pseudocode, optimized for maximum syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence from the input, while perfectly preserving original semantics, class and function signatures, and code structure. Do not output anything else.
