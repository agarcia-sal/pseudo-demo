Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally and behaviorally identical version that strictly **preserves all original function names and their exact parameter names, as well as all class names and the original class/interface hierarchies and nesting structures** entirely unchanged.

Your rewritten pseudocode must maintain 100% semantic equivalence with the input: the output should perform exactly the same computations and produce the same results for all inputs.

However, maximize *syntactic, structural,* and *stylistic* divergence to the greatest extent possible, making the output appear as different as possible while preserving all core names and interface schemas.

To achieve this, perform an extensive and systematic application of the following transformation categories, combining many of them creatively and thoroughly:

1. **Control-flow diversification:**  
   - Convert loops freely between FOR, WHILE, RECURSION (including tail and mutual recursion), and explicit iterators, altering loop variables and loop conditions with equivalent logic.  
   - Transform conditional logic by: replacing cascaded IF-ELSE with SWITCH/CASE or vice versa; flatten or deepen nested conditionals arbitrarily; replace conditionals with guard clauses or early exits; reorder independent statements and branches safely.  
   - Use boolean sentinel flags, auxiliary state variables, and loop invariants to rewrite flow control.  
   - Interleave equivalent control flow constructs like BREAK, CONTINUE, or GOTO-style jumps if supported by pseudocode syntax.

2. **Systematic variable renaming:**  
   - Rename all local variables, temporary variables, and internally defined variables consistently to meaningful but completely new, non-overlapping identifiers that do not appear in the original pseudocode anywhere.  
   - **Do not rename function parameters, functions, or class names.** Ensure all references for renamed variables are consistent and correct throughout.

3. **Expression and condition restructuring:**  
   - Apply propositional logic equivalences to Boolean expressions extensively: De Morgan's laws, double negation, distribution, absorption, and factoring.  
   - Rewrite arithmetic expressions using algebraic identities, rearrangements, equivalent subexpressions, or introducing new helper variables for intermediate computations.  
   - Replace literal constants with computations or symbolic equivalents (e.g., `10^3` → `1000`, or `MAX_INT` → `2^31 - 1`).  
   - Change expression syntax style (e.g., infix to prefix/postfix notation), grouping, and order of evaluation without changing meaning.

4. **Data structure and data-access transformation:**  
   - Switch between analogous data structures where possible (list ↔ linked list, array ↔ vector, set ↔ hash set), provided semantics remain exact.  
   - Expand syntactic sugar (e.g., comprehensions, unpacking, slicing) into explicit loops and assignments, or introduce these sugar forms where absent.  
   - Reorganize data initialization and access patterns, including decomposing complex initializations or combining simple ones.

5. **Function and code modularization:**  
   - Inline small helper code fragments into caller functions or extract code blocks into new helper functions with unique well-chosen names (never reuse names from input except for preserved signatures).  
   - Reorder functions inside classes or modules arbitrarily, preserving exact signatures and accessibility scopes.  
   - Use named arguments only if the original syntax style permits and does not alter semantics; maintain parameter names and ordering.

6. **Formatting and style variability:**  
   - Use diverse indentation patterns, line breaks, whitespace, and casing conventions for all keywords and identifiers (e.g., uppercase/lowercase/mixed-case keywords consistently per output).  
   - Substitute keywords with valid alternatives allowed in the pseudocode dialect (e.g., `IS` vs. `EQUALS`, `LET` vs. `SET`), uniformly applied.  
   - Preserve any comments exactly as in the original—do not add, remove, reorder, or modify comments in any way.  
   - Restructure code layout visually: grouping logically unrelated statements differently, combining multiple short statements into one line or splitting long statements.

**Critical constraints (strictly enforced):**

- Absolutely **do not** change or omit any comments, annotations, or explanatory text present in the input pseudocode; output only rewritten pseudocode with the comments left exactly as is.  
- Preserve **all** original function and method signatures identically: exact function names, exact parameter names, exact number and order of parameters, exact return types (if specified).  
- Preserve **all** class and interface names as given, as well as their original hierarchical and structural relationships—class nesting, inheritance, or interface implementation must remain exactly the same.  
- The transformed code must be runnable in equivalent pseudocode environment with *no semantic changes whatsoever*—outputs, side effects, and internal behavior must remain perfectly identical.  
- Avoid introducing any pseudocode constructs, keywords, or library functions not supported or clearly inferred from the input pseudocode's original language style or dialect.  
- Ensure all renamed variables do not collide with any existing names and are applied consistently within the scope of renaming.

**Output ONLY** the fully transformed pseudocode adhering to the above. Do not include any explanations, comments, or supplementary text beyond the rewritten pseudocode itself.

This prompt is to be applied universally to any input pseudocode regardless of problem domain or programming paradigm.
