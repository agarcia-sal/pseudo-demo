Rewrite the provided pseudocode to create a version that is functionally identical but differs as drastically as possible in every aspect of syntax, structure, formatting, variable naming, and control flow style. Preserve all original function names verbatim, intact class names, and maintain all class and object relationships exactly as in the source. Transform looping constructs (e.g., convert FOR loops to WHILE loops, introduce recursion where feasible), reorder and restructure expressions, rename variables thoroughly (except function/class identifiers), replace data structures with alternatives that serve the same purpose, and vary formatting and indentation to maximize syntactic divergence. Avoid adding any explanations, comments, or annotations—output only the rewritten pseudocode itself. The output must be exclusively pseudocode in a self-contained form matching the input’s module/class context and functionality.
