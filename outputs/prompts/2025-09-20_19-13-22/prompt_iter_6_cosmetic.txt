Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a fully functionally equivalent version that preserves all original class names, function names, and their exact hierarchical placements, but transforms every other aspect to maximize syntactic, stylistic, and structural difference. Techniques to apply include — but are not limited to — altering control flow constructs (e.g., convert loops to recursion, swap FOR and WHILE, use different conditional patterns), changing variable names consistently yet distinctly, reorganizing and nesting code blocks differently, varying expression orders and logic equivalences, employing alternative data handling or manipulation idioms, and modifying formatting and spacing extensively. Do not alter any semantics, return values, or side effects. Do not introduce any new algorithms or external libraries not implied by the pseudocode semantics. Do not add comments, explanations, or extraneous text. The output must be solely the rewritten pseudocode without any preamble or postscript. Maintain all original class and function names exactly as in the input, preserving their original nesting and object structures verbatim.
