Rewrite the input pseudocode into a version that is semantically identical and produces exactly the same observable behavior, while maximizing syntactic, structural, and stylistic differences across all aspects except names of classes, functions, and function parameters, which must remain entirely unchanged and in their original positions within class and object hierarchies.

Your rewritten pseudocode must satisfy these strict constraints:

- **Do not change any class names, function names, or parameter names.** Preserve their order, placement, and the full class/object inheritance and interface hierarchies exactly as in the input.

- **Retain all comments, annotations, explanatory texts, and docstrings verbatim.** Do not add, remove, or alter any textual commentary or documentation.

- **Preserve 100% behavioral and semantic equivalence:** outputs, side effects, data flow, control flow, and interactions must be identical.

To achieve maximal difference in all other dimensions, systematically and creatively apply diverse transformations from but not limited to the following categories, individually or in combination, ensuring all renamings and restructurings are consistent and conflict-free:

1. **Control Flow and Logical Structure Recomposition:**  
   - Convert between loop types: FOR ↔ WHILE ↔ RECURSION (including tail and mutual recursion) wherever semantics allow.  
   - Replace flat conditional chains (e.g., IF-ELSE, ELSE IF) by nested ifs, SWITCH/CASE constructs, early-exit guard clauses, boolean flags controlling flow, or combined/muted boolean expressions.  
   - Rearrange and regroup logically independent statements and blocks, inserting or removing nested scopes/blocks as long as execution order and dependencies remain intact.  
   - Introduce sentinel or guard variables to control loops or conditionals.  
   - Decompose or recombine complex boolean and arithmetic conditions employing Boolean algebra transformations (De Morgan’s laws, absorption, distribution, inversions) and algebraic equivalences.

2. **Identifier Transformation Strictness:**  
   - Leave class names, function names, and parameter names completely unchanged everywhere.  
   - Rename **all other identifiers** — local variables, temporaries, loop indices, internal helpers, data structure element names — to fresh, meaningful, language-appropriate alternatives that are different from any original identifier, with full consistent renaming throughout.  
   - Separate naming scopes to avoid shadowing or reuse of original local names.

3. **Expression and Operator Variation:**  
   - Rewrite all arithmetic expressions using equivalent algebraic identities: factorization, expansion, reordering, substitution of literals with calculations, and vice versa.  
   - Transform logical expressions thoroughly using Boolean algebra.  
   - Change expression notation styles where supported (infix, prefix, postfix, explicit function calls).  
   - Extract repeated or complex sub-expressions into well-named helper variables.

4. **Data Structure and Access Pattern Transformation:**  
   - Replace data structures with semantically equivalent alternatives (arrays → lists → linked lists → stacks → queues → sets) where preserving behavior.  
   - Convert comprehensions to explicit loops and vice versa where allowed.  
   - Change order of iteration, indexing schemes, or introduce iterators as alternate access patterns.  
   - Modify initialization techniques and mutation sequences without altering final semantics.

5. **Decomposition and Recomposition of Functions and Modules:**  
   - Inline small functions or extract code blocks into new uniquely named helper functions to restructure logic.  
   - Reorder functions/methods inside classes or modules without changing names or parameter lists.  
   - Employ named or positional calls interchangeably if allowed, preserving names and counts.  
   - Rearrange evaluation order of parameters and arguments as long as calling conventions and meaning remain stable.

6. **Styling and Formatting Variance:**  
   - Vary line indentations dramatically, insert or remove blank lines, and change line breaks.  
   - Alternate keyword casing consistently (uppercase, lowercase, Title Case) or use known synonyms where supported by the pseudocode language (e.g., USE instead of CALL, LET instead of SET, IS instead of EQUALS), ensuring keyword equivalence.  
   - Adjust spacing, alignment, and comment alignment without altering comment contents.

7. **Semantic Integrity and Language Constraints:**  
   - All output must be valid pseudocode consistent with the input’s language style and constructs or their exact semantic equivalents—do not invent unsupported keywords or constructs.  
   - Strictly keep the original class structure and object hierarchy intact.  
   - Consistency must be absolute—any renamed variable or helper identifier must be renamed the same way everywhere it appears.  
   - Preserve all input comments, annotations, and docstrings exactly without any addition or deletion.

**In your output, produce only the fully rewritten pseudocode that meets all these criteria, omitting any notes, explanations, or commentary.**
