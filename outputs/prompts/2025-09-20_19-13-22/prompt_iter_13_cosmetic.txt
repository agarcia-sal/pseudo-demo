Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a version that is semantically identical but exhibits maximal divergence from the original in terms of syntax, control flow constructs, variable naming, and overall structure. Preserve all original class names and their hierarchies as well as all function names exactly as given. You must not alter the logic or output of any part of the code.

To maximize difference, apply these comprehensive transformations wherever possible, without changing the program’s meaning:

- Replace loop types: convert FOR loops to WHILE loops, WHILE loops to recursion, or vice versa.
- Reorganize code blocks and reorder independent statements safely.
- Rename all local variables and parameters systematically, using consistent but distinct identifiers.
- Break down complex expressions into smaller sub-expressions or combine smaller expressions.
- Swap the order of operands in commutative operations (e.g., change `a + b` to `b + a`).
- Use alternative control flow primitives: e.g., replace IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH/CASE, or nested IFs, or guard clauses.
- Replace inline conditionals with explicit IF statements or vice versa.
- Change initialization and assignment styles, e.g., use incremental updates instead of direct assignment.
- Flatten nested blocks where possible or introduce additional nested scopes for clarity.
- Use different but equivalent data access patterns (e.g., indexing via an iterator vs direct index).
- Reformat indentation, spacing, and line breaks extensively to diverge from original presentation.
- Replace literal constants with equivalent expressions where feasible (e.g., `2 * 3` instead of `6`).
- Use alternative but equivalent statements for data structure operations while preserving semantics.

Do not add any comments, explanations, output formatting, or metadata—only output the rewritten pseudocode. The output must be strictly pseudocode, not code in any particular programming language. Always keep the original class and function names and overall class/object structure unchanged.

Output only the transformed pseudocode.
