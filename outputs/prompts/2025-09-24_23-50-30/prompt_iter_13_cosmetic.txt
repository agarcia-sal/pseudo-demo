Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally identical but syntactically and structurally maximally distinct version, obeying the following rules precisely:

1. **Function names and class names must remain unchanged**, preserving all original class and object hierarchies, inheritance relationships, and structure exactly as in the input. These identifiers should not be renamed or reordered.

2. The output must be **valid, self-contained pseudocode only**, without any explanatory text, comments, or code annotations.

3. Change every other element of the pseudocode extensively to maximize difference while preserving exact input-output behavior and side effects, including but not limited to:
   - Convert iterative loops into recursion or comprehensions (where stack limits allow), or vice versa, choosing the method best suited to avoid excessive recursion depth.
   - Substitute conditional constructs (e.g., replace nested if-else with guard clauses, switch/case, or early returns) without altering logic.
   - Rename all variables and parameters except functions and classes to new semantically neutral, non-conflicting identifiers.
   - Rearrange independent statements, conditions, and expressions where the sequence does not impact semantics.
   - Replace arithmetic and logical expressions with equivalent but different formulations (e.g., use addition instead of subtraction with a negative number).
   - Swap data structures for functionally equivalent alternatives (e.g., arrays, lists, sets, maps) or refactor nested loops into map/filter/reduce pipelines.
   - Merge or split statements logically, modify formatting (indentation, line breaks, spacing) to yield a significantly different code layout.
   - Use alternative but valid pseudocode keywords and constructs to express the same operations (e.g., "INCREMENT x BY 1" vs. "x := x + 1").
   - Restructure helper or nested functions when possible, ensuring termination and performance considerations (prefer iteration to recursion when recursion depth risk exists).

4. **Preserve all semantics perfectly** — the transformed pseudocode must produce identical results and side effects for all inputs, including corner cases.

5. **Do not introduce syntax or idioms inconsistent with the original pseudocode paradigm or require external dependencies.**

6. Remove any dead code, redundant conditions, or no-op instructions only if guaranteed not to affect visibility or behavior.

7. If recursion is used, ensure termination conditions are explicit and safe to prevent stack overflow or infinite recursion, switching to iteration if needed.

Provide only the final transformed pseudocode as output—nothing else. Prioritize maximal syntactic, structural, and lexical divergence while keeping flawless functional equivalence and adherence to the above constraints.
