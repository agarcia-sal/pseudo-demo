Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally equivalent version that differs maximally from the original in terms of control structures, variable naming, formatting style, expression forms, and algorithmic flowâ€”while strictly preserving all original behavior and results. Retain original function names and class names exactly, and maintain the same class/object nesting and hierarchy without adding or removing any classes or methods. Use alternative looping constructs, restructuring (e.g., convert loops to recursion or comprehensions where feasible), invert conditions, reorder equivalent statements, change iteration orders, substitute data structures with analogous ones, and vary expression syntax to maximize diversity. Avoid introducing comments or explanations; output only the rewritten pseudocode that would produce identical outputs for all valid inputs.
