Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that is **semantically and behaviorally equivalent**, meeting these strict requirements:

- Keep **all original function names, class names, and their nesting, including classes/objects and inheritance hierarchies exactly as in the original**, preserving their spelling and casing without any change or omission.

- Produce output containing **only complete, valid pseudocode** implementing the same logic; no explanations, comments, or extraneous text allowed.

- Preserve **all original input-output behavior, side-effects, termination guarantees, error conditions, and correctness properties identically**—no addition, removal, or modification of functionality is allowed.

- Rename **only local identifiers** (local variables, parameters, constants/internal temporaries) to novel, unrelated, semantically neutral names, ensuring no collisions or shadowing anywhere in their scopes, and keep these replacements consistent throughout the transformed code.

- Maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence by applying a rich combination of these transformations, as deeply and thoroughly as possible without altering semantics:

  - Convert between different loop forms (for, while), unfold or factor loops into recursion and vice versa; use tail recursion or iterative state machines where feasible to prevent deep recursion stack issues.

  - Replace conditional constructs with logically equivalent alternatives, including if-else chains, nested conditions, switch/case-like dispatch, ternary expressions, Boolean algebra rewrites (De Morgan’s laws, factoring, flipping conditions), and rearranged or simplified predicates.

  - Restructure control flow by splitting, merging, reordering, or grouping statements and blocks wherever behavior remains identical; flatten nested blocks or add helper subroutines internally if needed.

  - Swap equivalent expressions or algorithms locally—rewrite arithmetic expressions by rearranging operand order or grouping, fold or unfold constants, replace operators by identity or commutative transformations, and rewrite boolean expressions into equivalent but different forms.

  - Substitute data structure representations with alternative but behavior-preserving forms whenever possible (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets, index-based access ↔ iterator traversal), as long as program semantics remain perfectly preserved.

  - Implement diverse, aggressive formatting alterations: vary indentation, line breaks, spacing, keyword casing, statement delimiters, and syntactic sugar to maximize surface-level difference.

- Eliminate only strictly unreachable or redundant code **if and only if** its removal does **not** alter any externally observable behavior or correctness guarantees.

- Do **not** introduce any new language features, paradigms, or constructs not already present in the original pseudocode.

- Do **not** alter the original function/class signatures or top-level declarations.

- When recursion is used, if it risks causing deep stack calls, convert the recursion into safe iterative or tail-recursive form without changing semantics.

Your output must contain **only the transformed pseudocode code** of the entire original input, fulfilling all these conditions to produce a version that is as different as possible syntactically, structurally, and stylistically from the original, while being functionally identical and passing all tests exactly.

This ensures maximal orthogonality, novelty, and correctness preservation between the original and rewritten pseudocode.
