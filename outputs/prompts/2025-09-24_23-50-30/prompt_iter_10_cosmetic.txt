Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a version that is fully functionally equivalent but **maximally divergent** in terms of syntax, structure, and style, abiding by these strict rules:

1. **Preserve all original function and class names exactly as they are, along with the original class hierarchy, object relationships, and inheritance.** Do not modify these identifiers or their structural relationships.

2. The output must contain **only valid, self-contained pseudocode**—do not include any explanations, comments, notes, or metadata.

3. **Apply comprehensive transformations in every other dimension** to achieve maximal difference from the original pseudocode, including but not limited to:

   - Replacing iterative constructs with recursive ones or vice versa; use comprehensions, generators, or equivalent control structures when possible.
   
   - Reworking conditional logic extensively: substitute `if-else` chains with guard clauses, switch/case structures, ternary-like expressions, or logical operators.
   
   - Systematically rename all local variables, parameters, and temporary values to new, semantically neutral, non-conflicting names unrelated to the originals.
   
   - Reorder any independent statements, expressions, or blocks where semantic correctness permits.
   
   - Substitute arithmetic and logical expressions with equivalent but syntactically or operationally different formulations.
   
   - Where suitable, change native data structures to alternative forms (e.g., arrays to lists or sets, loops to pipeline-style transformations), preserving functionality exactly.
   
   - Restructure code by splitting complex statements into simpler parts or merging straightforward sequences.
   
   - Vary formatting rigorously including indentation style, line breaks, statement placement, and spacing.
   
   - Introduce alternative control flow mechanisms such as early returns, continuations, or labeled jumps only if supported by the language paradigm and semantics.

4. **Guarantee perfect preservation of all input-output behavior, side effects, and termination properties.** Recursive definitions must maintain base cases and avoid deep recursion that risks exceeding typical call stack limits—prefer iterative forms when the problem size may cause stack overflow.

5. Avoid introducing any external library calls, language-specific syntax, or constructs not compatible with the original pseudocode’s assumed abstraction level or paradigm.

6. Remove dead code, redundant computations, or useless temporary variables **only if they do not affect observable behavior or timing side effects**.

Your output should be **only the rewritten pseudocode** following these principles, achieving maximal syntactic and structural deviation while flawlessly preserving operational semantics. No additional text.
