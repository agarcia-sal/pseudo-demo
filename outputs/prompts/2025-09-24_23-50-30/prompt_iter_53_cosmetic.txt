Rewrite the provided pseudocode to produce a functionally identical version that strictly satisfies these requirements:

- **Functionality Preservation:** Exactly preserve all original observable behaviors, side-effects, input/output contracts, termination conditions, and correctness without exception.

- **Name Preservation:** Retain **all original function names, class names, and the exact class/object nesting and inheritance hierarchies, including casing and spelling.** No changes allowed to these identifiers or program structure.

- **Identifier Renaming:** Replace **all other identifiers (local variables, parameters, constants, temporaries)** with newly invented, unrelated, semantically neutral names. These new names must never shadow or conflict within their scope and must be used consistently throughout.

- **Code-Only Output:** Output must be **only valid, self-contained pseudocode** implementing the transformed program. No comments, explanations, markdown delimiters, or any extra text allowed.

- **Maximized Structural & Syntactic Divergence:** Achieve the greatest possible surface and semantic-preserving structural difference by applying an aggressive and diverse combination of semantically valid transformations, including but not limited to:

  - Converting iterative loops (for, while) into recursion, tail-recursion, generator-style iteration, comprehensions, or alternate control flow constructs — and vice versa.

  - Thoroughly restructuring conditional logic including rewriting if-else chains as switch/case, nested guards, boolean-equivalent expressions using De Morgan’s laws, ternary constructs, exhaustive pattern matching alternatives, or equivalent logical rearrangements.

  - Substituting data structure representations with equivalent forms where behavior allows (e.g., lists vs arrays vs sets, linked vs indexed).

  - Arbitrarily reordering, splitting, merging, or regrouping statements and basic blocks whenever semantic preservation permits.

  - Re-expressing expressions with logically equivalent forms: altered operand orders, factorizations, expansions, boolean negations, constant folding/unfolding variants, distributive rearrangements.

  - Varying formatting extensively: indentation styles, line breaks, whitespace distribution, statement sequencing — any superficial syntactic variation allowed.

  - Transforming recursive procedures that risk stack overflow into equivalent iterative or tail-recursive forms that guarantee safe termination and memory behavior.

- **No Functional Augmentation or Removal:** Do not add, remove, or alter any functionality, language paradigms, or semantic effects beyond what is already present (except eliminating only provably unreachable or redundant code that leaves all behaviors intact).

- **Rigorous Semantic Equivalence:** The output pseudocode **must be semantically and behaviorally indistinguishable** from the input under all valid inputs and execution paths.

- **Strictly Prohibit Additional Text:** Output only the rewritten pseudocode program without any annotation or delimiter.

Apply these principles comprehensively to yield a maximally orthogonal, novel, and syntactically distinct pseudocode version of the original while preserving every aspect of its original semantics and correctness guarantees.
