Rewrite the given pseudocode into a **semantically identical yet maximally syntactically and structurally divergent** version, preserving all original functionality, input-output behavior, side effects, return values, exceptions, and termination guarantees.

**Strict requirements:**

- **Retain exact original function and class names, including spelling and casing. Preserve all nesting, inheritance, and object/class structural hierarchies without changes.**

- **Exclude comments, explanations, or any text other than pseudocode. Output only complete, valid pseudocode.**

- Rename *only* all variable names, parameters, constants, and temporary identifiers to unrelated, semantically neutral alternatives with consistent scope usage, avoiding naming collisions.

- Apply multiple, combined, and layered transformations that include but are not limited to:

  - Change control flow paradigm: convert loops to recursion (including tail recursion), recursion to iteration, or use functional-style constructs (map/filter/reduce/comprehensions), while ensuring no change to semantics or termination.

  - Rewrite conditionals extensively: replace if-else chains with switch/case, nested guards, ternary expressions, or logically equivalent expressions via boolean algebra (e.g., De Morgan’s laws), rearranged logic tests, or reordered branches.

  - Replace data structures with fully equivalent alternatives that preserve behavior (e.g., arrays ↔ lists, sets ↔ hashed collections, linked vs indexed structures) and rewrite all operations accordingly.

  - Refactor the code structure by splitting or merging statements, reordering independent statements or blocks safely, introducing helper functions or inlining existing ones differently, and restructuring expressions to increase novelty without changing meaning.

  - Rewrite arithmetic and logical expressions using equivalent transformations (e.g., `a + b` ↔ `b + a`, `!(x && y)` ↔ `!x || !y`, constant folding/unfolding, distributive and associative rearrangements).

  - Aggressively vary formatting: indent styles, line breaks, statement ordering where safe, whitespace, explicit parentheses, and grouping to maximize textual divergence.

  - For deep recursion risks, replace recursion with iterative equivalents or tail-call optimized forms to avoid stack overflows, while preserving semantics.

- Do not introduce any constructs, keywords, external libraries, or language features absent in the original pseudocode’s paradigm.

- Prune unreachable or redundant code only when guaranteed not to alter externally observable program behavior.

**Your output must be solely the transformed pseudocode implementing the above, optimized for maximal orthogonality and novelty versus the input, while perfectly preserving all semantics and correctness.**
