Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally equivalent version that maximizes syntactic, structural, and semantic divergence from the original, while strictly preserving all functionality and side effects. Follow these detailed instructions:

1. **Preserve exactly all original function and class names, and maintain the original class hierarchy and object structures without any change.**

2. The output must be **pure, syntactically valid pseudocode only**—do not include any explanations, comments, annotations, or meta-text.

3. Extensively transform every reproducible aspect of the pseudocode except the above, including but not limited to:

   - Convert iterative constructs into recursive ones where safe and efficient; otherwise convert recursion to loops. Prefer iteration if recursion risks exceeding typical stack limits.
   - Replace standard control structures by semantically equivalent alternatives: e.g., substitute if–else chains with guard clauses, switch/case, or pattern-matching style logic if applicable.
   - Rename all variable names and parameter identifiers (except functions/classes) to unique, semantically neutral tokens different from originals.
   - Shuffle independent statements or expressions where order does not affect program semantics.
   - Reformulate arithmetic, logical, and boolean expressions into equivalent but distinctly different forms (e.g., use subtraction instead of addition by negation, De Morgan laws, different order of operands).
   - Replace data structures with alternatives achieving the same effect (e.g., arrays ↔ lists, explicit accumulators ↔ comprehensions or filters).
   - Control nesting depth by splitting or merging statements, flattening or deepening structure as feasible.
   - Alter style features: use diverse indentation styles, line breaks, grouping parentheses, and spacing conventions.
   - Re-express sequence processing with different paradigms: switching between explicit loops, list comprehensions, map/filter reductions, or accumulators.

4. **Strictly retain the original input-output contract and side effects, including output format and error conditions. No functional weakening or strengthening allowed.**

5. Do **not** introduce any external libraries, language-specific keywords or syntax not supported by the original pseudocode context or paradigm.

6. Remove dead code, redundant checks, or no-op instructions only if doing so does not modify any original side effect or output.

7. If recursion depth would be unfeasible, replace recursion with carefully constructed iteration that preserves same logic and guarantees termination.

8. Avoid shortcuts or simplifications that change subtle semantic behavior, even if allowed mathematically.

Produce solely the rewritten pseudocode reflecting maximal difference in syntax and structure while maintaining perfect functional equivalence and identical naming of functions and classes. No explanations or comments—only the transformed pseudocode.
