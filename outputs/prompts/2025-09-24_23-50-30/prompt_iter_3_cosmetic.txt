Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally equivalent version that differs as much as possible from the original in terms of syntax, control structures, variable naming, order of operations, formatting, and expression style. Preserve exactly all functionality, including input/output behavior and logic. Keep all original function names, class names, and their hierarchical organization intact without changes. Avoid using the same statements, loops, or idioms verbatim—instead, transform loops into different kinds of iteration or recursion, replace control flow constructs (e.g., convert WHILE into FOR or vice versa), simplify or expand expressions creatively, rearrange statements where possible, and substitute operations with equivalent alternatives. Do not add any explanations, comments, or extraneous text—output only the rewritten pseudocode. Ensure the output pseudocode can seamlessly replace the original in any relevant context without altering its functional results.
