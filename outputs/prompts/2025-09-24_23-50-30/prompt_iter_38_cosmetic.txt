Rewrite the given pseudocode into a new version that **is functionally identical in every aspect**—preserving all input-output behavior, side effects, termination conditions, and algorithmic logic—while maintaining **exactly the same function names, class names, and class/object/inheritance/nesting structures with their original spellings and casing**.

**Your rewrite must satisfy these strict rules:**

1. **Output only the rewritten pseudocode, without any comments, explanations, or annotations.**

2. Keep all function and class identifiers unchanged and in the original place within the hierarchy and scope.

3. Rename **all other identifiers** (variables, parameters, constants, temporaries) to **fresh, unrelated, semantically neutral names**—avoiding collisions and ensuring correct usage and vocabulary consistency inside their scope.

4. Enforce maximal structural and syntactic novelty by applying a broad, **combined, and aggressive mix** of the following transformations wherever logically sound and semantics-preserving:

   - Change control flow styles: convert loops (for, while) into tail-recursive or ordinary recursion, comprehensions, or functional pipelines, and vice versa.

   - Rewrite conditionals extensively, for example replacing if-else chains with switch/case, nested conditionals, guarded return patterns, ternary-like constructs, logically equivalent boolean expressions using De Morgan’s laws, contrapositives, or reordered conditions.

   - Re-express data representations using alternative but behaviorally equivalent data structures when possible (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets, linked sequences ↔ indexed sequences).

   - Split, merge, or reorder independent statements or blocks without semantic changes.

   - Apply algebraic or logical rewrites of expressions, such as commutative operand reorderings, factoring, unfolding or folding constants, double negations, or logically equivalent boolean identities.

   - Aggressively vary formatting: alter indentation levels, line breaks, statement grouping, spacing, and statement order as long as program semantics remain unchanged.

   - For recursive functions prone to stack overflow, use equivalent tail recursion or iterative forms to ensure safe termination without changing semantics.

5. Do not introduce any new language features, libraries, or constructs beyond those clearly implied by the original pseudocode’s allowed idioms and paradigm.

6. Remove unreachable or redundant code **only if** this does not alter external observable behavior.

7. Ensure all renamed identifiers are consistent throughout each scope, and no identifier clashes or shadowings occur.

**The overall goal: produce a rewritten pseudocode that is as orthogonally different from the original as possible on a syntactic and structural level, yet identical in every semantic and correctness guarantee.**  
Output must be a valid, self-contained pseudocode snippet ready to replace the original exactly.
