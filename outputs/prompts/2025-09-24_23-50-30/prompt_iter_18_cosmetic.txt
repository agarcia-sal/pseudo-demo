Rewrite the input pseudocode into a semantically identical but syntactically and structurally maximally divergent version, complying fully with these explicit requirements:

1. Preserve **all original function and class names exactly**, including their hierarchy, inheritance, and encapsulation structure—do not rename or alter these.

2. Only output valid, self-contained pseudocode that can stand alone—do not include any explanations, comments, annotations, or external text.

3. Transform every other element of the code extensively, applying but not limited to these transformations, wherever logically and functionally safe:

   - Convert iterative loops to recursive definitions, and recursive processes to iterative loops, choosing form best suited to limit maximum recursion depth and avoid overflow.

   - Break down complex statements into multiple simpler statements, or combine sequences of simple statements into compound expressions or inline expressions.

   - Change control flow constructs: replace if-else with guard clauses, invert conditions, substitute switch/case with if-chains, use early returns or accumulate via expressions.

   - Rename all local variables, parameters, and internal identifiers (excluding function and class names) to semantically neutral but unique alternatives that do not overlap with original names.

   - Restructure order of independent statements and reorder expressions where result does not hinge on execution order.

   - Substitute data structures with functionally equivalent alternatives (e.g., lists ↔ arrays, sets ↔ dictionaries with boolean flags) and restructure data traversal accordingly.

   - Use algebraically or logically equivalent but syntactically distinct expressions or operations (for example, replace `a = b + 0` with `a = b`, or `x mod y = 0` with `(x div y) * y = x`).

   - Vary formatting extensively: use different indentation styles, line breaks, relative spacing, and grouping.

4. Preserve precisely the original input-output behavior and side effects in all scenarios—outputs, returned values, and mutations must match exactly.

5. Avoid introducing any syntax, notation, or constructs beyond the paradigm of the input pseudocode; no language-specific features, libraries, or external dependencies may be added.

6. When using recursion, ensure termination conditions prevent excessive recursion depth; prefer iterative forms in cases where the recursion could be unbounded or too deep.

7. Remove any unreachable code or redundant checks only if doing so does not alter any externally observable behavior.

Your output must be the rewritten pseudocode only, reflecting maximal syntactic and structural departure from the original, while maintaining flawless functional equivalence, and preserving original function and class names and hierarchies verbatim.
