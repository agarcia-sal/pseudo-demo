Rewrite the input pseudocode to produce a functionally identical but maximally syntactically and structurally distinct version, strictly observing these directives:

1. **Preserve all original function names, class names, and their hierarchical organization exactly as in the input**, including inheritance and nesting; no renaming or structural changes to these identifiers or relationships.

2. Output **only the rewritten pseudocode—no comments, explanations, or extra text**.

3. Aggressively transform every other element of the pseudocode to maximize dissimilarity while ensuring correctness and identical behavior. Transformation strategies include, but are not limited to:

   - Convert loops to recursion and recursion to loops where safe and reasonable, avoiding excessive recursion depth.
   - Replace conditionals with logically equivalent alternative constructs (e.g., switch/case, guard clauses, nested ternaries).
   - Rename all variables and non-structural parameters to fresh, semantically neutral identifiers that do not appear in the original.
   - Vary statement ordering when order does not affect program semantics.
   - Replace arithmetic, logical, or boolean expressions with equivalent but differently structured expressions.
   - Substitute data structures with alternative ones that provide identical functionality (e.g., lists ↔ arrays, sets ↔ hash collections).
   - Reformat code extensively: alter indentation style, line breaks, grouping of statements, and block delimiters.
   - Merge or split statements arbitrarily as long as semantics remain unchanged.
   - Re-express expressions and control flows using different pseudocode idioms or paradigms compatible with the original language’s style and domain.
   - Incorporate short-circuit evaluations or inverted logic where applicable to vary flow.
   - Remove any redundant or unreachable code only if it does not affect output or side effects.

4. The transformed pseudocode must **produce the exact same output and side effects in all scenarios as the original**, with no changes to the functional contract.

5. Do not introduce any external libraries, dependencies, domain-specific constructs, or features unsupported by the original pseudocode’s environment or paradigm.

6. Carefully ensure any recursive implementations include proper and effective base cases to avoid runtime errors; prefer iterative or memoized approaches if recursion risks stack overflows.

7. Maintain the original’s input and output interface without modification.

Produce only the rewritten pseudocode as your output, explicitly maximizing structural, syntactical, and lexical novelty while guaranteeing flawless functional equivalence and adherence to the original identifiers and class structures.
