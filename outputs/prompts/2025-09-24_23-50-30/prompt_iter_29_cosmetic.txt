Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that is **functionally identical in every observable way**, preserving:

- All **function names and signatures** exactly (including spelling and capitalization).
- All **class names, their nesting, inheritance, and object structure** unchanged.
- The same **input-output behavior, side-effects, and termination conditions**.

Produce output containing **only valid, self-contained pseudocode** that fully implements the given logic, without any explanations, comments, or auxiliary text.

To maximize dissimilarity while maintaining correctness and structure, apply a broad, aggressive combination of these transformations wherever semantically safe:

1. Rename *all variables, parameters, constants, and temporary identifiers* to unrelated, semantically neutral, and consistently used alternatives within their scopes—avoid collisions.

2. Restructure control flows by interchanging iterative constructs and recursion (including tail recursion), using comprehensions, filters, maps, folds, or equivalent logical expressions, and vice versa.

3. Rewrite conditionals with alternative logically equivalent forms—e.g., switch/case for if-else chains, De Morgan's laws, nested guards, ternary-style expressions, or logically re-ordered boolean expressions.

4. Replace data structures with semantically equivalent alternatives when permitted—e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets; indexed vs linked data; accumulate states differently without changing logic.

5. Reorganize code by splitting, merging, reordering, or grouping statements and blocks non-disruptively.

6. Substitute arithmetic and logical expressions with variants that yield the same results (e.g., reordering operands, alternative identities, folding constants differently).

7. Aggressively vary formatting: insert irregular indentations, line breaks, spaces, and reorder statements when order is semantically irrelevant to maximize surface dissimilarity.

8. For recursive processes vulnerable to stack overflow, replace with iterative or tail-recursive equivalents preserving behavior.

9. Remove unreachable or redundant code only if guaranteed not to affect external observable behavior.

Do **not** introduce new language-specific features, external libraries, or constructs beyond those implied by the original pseudocode’s paradigm and style.

Your output must be exclusively the rewritten pseudocode meeting the above conditions, optimizing for maximal syntactic, structural, and lexical novelty **while perfectly retaining all semantic and correctness guarantees**.
