Rewrite the input pseudocode into a functionally identical but maximally syntactically and structurally divergent version by adhering to the following instructions:

- Preserve **all original function and class names exactly**, along with the complete original class hierarchy, object structures, and inheritance relationships, without any renaming or restructuring.

- The output must be **only valid pseudocode** implementing the same logic and producing the same input-output behavior and side effects; **do not include comments, explanations, or any text outside the pseudocode itself**.

- Achieve maximal transformation by exhaustively applying diverse and non-trivial rewrites across the entire pseudocode, including but not limited to:

  1. **Control Flow Transformations**  
     - Convert iterative constructs into recursive forms and vice versa, respecting recursion depth limits to avoid excessive stack usage.  
     - Replace standard conditional branching with early exits, guard clauses, switch/case constructs, or nested conditional expressions as appropriate.  
     - Inline simple functions into main bodies or extract inline logic into helper functions while preserving functionality.  
  
  2. **Variable and Parameter Renaming**  
     - Rename all local variables, parameters, and temporary identifiers to semantically neutral, distinct, and consistently reformatted names, excluding functions/classes.  
     - Maintain consistent renamed identifiers throughout the scope to preserve semantics.  
  
  3. **Data Structure Refactoring**  
     - Substitute equivalent data types (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets ↔ queues) when logic allows, adjusting code accordingly.  
     - Replace loops with comprehensions, map/filter pipelines, or reduce-like constructions where feasible.  
  
  4. **Expression Rewriting**  
     - Rewrite arithmetic and logical expressions into alternative mathematically or logically equivalent forms (e.g., replacing `(a != b)` with `NOT (a == b)`, or rewriting `a * b` via additions inside loops if practical).  
     - Change order of independent statements and combine or split compound statements while maintaining correctness.  
  
  5. **Formatting and Structural Variations**  
     - Alter indentation styles, line breaks, and statement grouping to differ significantly from the original layout.  
     - Reformat loops or conditionals using different syntax conventions consistent with pseudocode paradigms.  
  
  6. **Dead Code and Redundancy Handling**  
     - Remove any unreachable code, redundant checks, or superfluous temporary variables only if doing so does not affect observable behavior or side effects.  
  
  7. **Recursion and Iteration Safety**  
     - For recursive algorithms, ensure recursive depth is controlled. Prefer iterative reimplementation when recursion depth might be excessive.  
  
  8. **Side Effect Preservation**  
     - Maintain precise input-output behavior and side effects unchanged in every possible execution scenario.  
  
- **Do not introduce** any external libraries, language-specific constructs, or dependencies absent from the original pseudocode’s conceptual domain.

- The final output must be **self-contained, executable pseudocode** suitable for the original problem context, not partial snippets or abstract descriptions.

Produce solely this rewritten pseudocode as your output, exhibiting maximal syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence from the input, while guaranteeing flawless functional equivalence.
