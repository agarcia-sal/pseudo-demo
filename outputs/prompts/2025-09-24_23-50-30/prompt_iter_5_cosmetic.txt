Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally equivalent yet maximally transformed version, adhering strictly to these criteria:

1. **Function and class names must remain exactly as in the original**, preserving the entire class and object hierarchy, inheritance, and structure without alteration.

2. The output must include **only valid, self-contained pseudocode**—no explanatory comments, annotations, or meta-text.

3. **Transform every other aspect of the pseudocode extensively** to diverge from the original. This includes, but is not limited to:
   - Replacing iterative loops with recursion or vice versa, or using comprehensions.
   - Restructuring control flow via alternative conditional expressions, guard clauses, or switch/case logic.
   - Renaming all non-function/class variables and parameters to semantically neutral but distinct names.
   - Reordering independent statements and expressions where order does not affect semantics.
   - Utilizing equivalent but different logical or arithmetic expressions.
   - Changing data structures to alternatives with the same functionality (e.g., arrays to lists or sets, nested loops to map/filter pipelines).
   - Modifying formatting, indentation style, and line breaks to differ substantially from the original.
   - Splitting or merging statements logically where feasible without changing meaning.

4. **Strictly preserve original input-output behavior and side effects**. The rewritten pseudocode must produce identical results in all cases.

5. Avoid introducing any external dependencies, language-specific syntax, or constructs not compatible with the original pseudocode’s paradigm.

6. For recursive algorithms, ensure termination conditions are preserved and stack overflow risks minimized; prefer iterative formulations if recursion depth would exceed typical constraints.

7. Eliminate dead code, redundant checks, or unnecessary intermediate steps only if they do not alter observable behavior.

Produce only the transformed pseudocode as your output, taking care to maximize syntactic and structural divergence while retaining flawless functional parity.
