Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a version that is **functionally identical** but exhibits **maximum syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence**, strictly observing the following requirements:

1. **Function and class identifiers, along with their hierarchy and inheritance structures, must remain exactly as in the original pseudocode—no renaming or structural modifications allowed to these elements.**

2. The output must be **only self-contained, valid pseudocode** that can be understood and executed as is. Do not include comments, explanations, or any non-code text.

3. Apply comprehensive and nuanced transformations to all other elements, including but not limited to:

   - **Convert iterative constructs (for, while) to recursion where practical and safe**, or vice versa; leverage comprehensions, pipelines, or expression-based alternatives when applicable.
   
   - **Rearrange independent statements and restructure control flows** using alternative logical forms such as guard clauses, nested ternary-style conditions, switch/case constructs, pattern matching analogs (if supported), or early returns.
   
   - **Rename all variables and parameters (except function/class names) to contextually neutral but distinct names**, applying consistent renaming throughout their scope.
   
   - **Vary data structures used**, opting for semantically equivalent alternatives (e.g., arrays ↔ lists, dictionaries ↔ maps) or different traversal and accumulation patterns (e.g., fold/reduce, map/filter) without altering functionality.
   
   - **Replace logical/arithmetic expressions with equivalent but dissimilar expressions**, including using negations, De Morgan transformations, alternative arithmetic identities, or algebraic rewrites.
   
   - **Change sequence and grouping of statements where semantic order independence is guaranteed**, including splitting/coalescing statements logically.
   
   - **Modify formatting extensively:** use different indentation styles, line breaks, spacing, keyword capitalizations, and block delimiters aligned with standard pseudocode conventions.
   
   - **Replace literal constants or values with equivalent expressions (e.g., 0 → false-equivalent, 1 → true-equivalent, x*2 → x+x)** when permitted without altering behavior.
   
4. **Preserve all functional behaviors exactly, including input/output, side effects, return values, and termination conditions.** For recursive transformations, ensure stack safety by preferring iteration if recursion depth could be excessive.

5. **Do not introduce any language-specific syntax, libraries, or constructs beyond the original pseudocode’s expressive power and paradigm.** Avoid external dependencies.

6. **Remove any dead code or redundancies only if guaranteed not to affect observable behavior.**

7. The rewritten pseudocode should exhibit **maximal novelty** in structure and appearance relative to the original, while fully preserving semantics.

**Return only the rewritten pseudocode as output.** No additional text, commentary, or explanation should be included.
