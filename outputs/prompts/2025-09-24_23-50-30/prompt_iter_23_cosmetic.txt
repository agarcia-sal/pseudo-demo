Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally identical version that strictly preserves all original function and class names, including their exact hierarchy, inheritance, and nesting, but differs as radically as possible in every other syntactic, structural, and stylistic aspect. The output must be valid, standalone pseudocode expressing the same logic with identical input-output behavior, side effects, and termination guarantees.

Guidelines:

1. **Do not modify any function or class identifiers** (names, casing, spelling) or their structural relationships; these must remain exactly as in the input pseudocode.

2. **Rename all other identifiers**, such as variable names and parameter names, to fresh, semantically neutral, and consistently used alternatives that do not conflict with any fixed names.

3. Maximize *semantic-preserving transformations* to increase novelty in all other facets:

   - Transform iterative loops into equivalent recursion (including tail-recursion) or vice versa, or replace with alternative iteration methods (e.g., comprehensions, filters, maps, reduce/fold, pipelines).

   - Convert conditional statements into logically equivalent variants, including but not limited to: guard clauses, nested versus flat, switch/case versus if-else chains, ternary expressions, Boolean algebra rewrites, De Morgan’s laws rewriting, and negation permutations.

   - Replace data structures with semantically interchangeable types (e.g., arrays, lists, sets, maps, linked structures) whenever the usage semantics permit.

   - Reorder or regroup independent or reorderable statements, and split or merge statements logically, ensuring no change in execution semantics.

   - Use equivalent arithmetic or logical transformations on expressions (e.g., reorder operands, distribute negations, change between operators as per equivalence).

   - Change formatting aggressively: vary indentation style and depth, line breaks, inline grouping, white space, and overall pseudocode organization.

   - For recursive functions, prefer iterative or tail recursive reformulations if recursion depth risks stack overflow while preserving exact effect.

   - Remove unreachable, redundant, or trivially dead code only if doing so changes no observable behavior in any input.

4. **Do NOT introduce any new language-specific constructs, libraries, or features** beyond what the original pseudocode paradigm implies.

5. The output must include only the transformed pseudocode; omit explanations, comments, annotations, or any additional text.

6. The transformed pseudocode must remain fully self-contained and realistic for the original problem’s domain.

Focus entirely on maximizing syntactic, structural, and naming divergence while guaranteeing flawless equivalence in functionality and side effects.

Produce only the transformed pseudocode.
