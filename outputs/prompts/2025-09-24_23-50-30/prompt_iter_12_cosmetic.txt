Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally identical version that is maximally dissimilar from the original, observing these strict rules:

- Preserve **all function and class names exactly**, and **retain the original class hierarchy, object relationships, and structural organization without any alteration**.

- Output only valid, standalone pseudocode; exclude any explanations, comments, or metadata.

- Apply comprehensive, deep transformations to every other element by employing a diverse array of techniques such as:
  - Converting iterative loops into recursion, recursion into iteration, or leveraging comprehension/filter/map-style constructs, but only when safe for termination and performance.
  - Recasting control flow using alternative conditional styles (e.g., if-else chains, guard clauses, switch/case statements, ternary-like expressions), reordered without changing observable behavior.
  - Renaming all variables and parameters that are not function or class identifiers to new names that are semantically neutral and distinct from the original.
  - Rearranging the order of statements and expressions where dependencies allow, to alter control and data flow appearance.
  - Replacing arithmetic, logical, or comparison operations with equivalent formulations (e.g., using `not`, De Morgan’s laws, additive inverses, equivalent boolean algebra).
  - Substituting data structures with alternative functionally equivalent types (arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets or queues, nested loops ↔ flat mappings or filters), without changing functionality or side effects.
  - Merging or splitting statements logically to change code granularity and format significantly.
  - Changing indentation style, line breaks, and spacing to differ markedly from the original while maintaining syntactic correctness.
  
- Rigorously maintain the **exact original input-output behavior and side effects**, ensuring no change in semantics whatsoever.

- Avoid introducing external dependencies, platform-specific or language-specific constructs, or syntactic elements incompatible with the original pseudocode paradigm.

- For recursive functions, guarantee that base cases remain intact, and ensure recursive depth is practical; prefer iterative alternatives if deep recursion is likely.

- Remove any unreachable code, redundancy, or unnecessary steps only if their removal does not change program behavior or side effects.

Your delivered output must be solely this transformed pseudocode, encapsulating maximum syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence from the input while flawlessly preserving its functional equivalence.
