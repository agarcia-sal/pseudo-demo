Rewrite the provided pseudocode to produce a fully self-contained, valid pseudocode version that preserves **100% identical functionality, behavior, input-output contracts, side effects, and termination conditions**, while adhering strictly to the following rules:

1. **Maintain absolutely all original function names, class names, method names, and the entire class/object/namespace/inheritance hierarchy structure exactly as given**, preserving spelling and casing without any modification or omission.

2. Within these constraints, perform **maximal semantic-preserving transformation** of the code to maximize syntactic and structural novelty, including but not limited to:
   - Exhaustively rename **all variable names, parameter names, constants, and temporary identifiers** to arbitrary, unrelated, semantically neutral alternatives. Maintain consistent renaming within scope, avoid name collisions, and never reuse original identifiers except for functions/classes as mandated.
   - Convert iterative control flows (for, while loops) into recursion, tail recursion, comprehensions, filter/map/reduce style pipelines, or equivalent constructs—and vice versa—where semantically valid.
   - Restructure conditional logic by replacing if-then-else chains with switch/case statements, nested conditions, guarded clauses, ternary expressions, De Morgan transformations, logically equivalent Boolean rewrites, or any logically sound rearrangement.
   - Rewrite data structures with equivalent representations where possible (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets; linked nodes ↔ indexed collections) without altering semantic outcomes.
   - Decompose, merge, reorder, or regroup statements and code blocks freely, provided no semantic or observable side-effect changes occur.
   - Replace arithmetic and logical expressions with algebraically/logically equivalent alternatives, including operand reordering, identity transformations, distribution, factoring, constant folding, and negation normal form conversions.
   - Use alternative formatting, indentation, line breaks, and statement ordering aggressively to increase surface syntactic variance.
   - When recursion would lead to potential stack overflow, convert to iterative or tail-recursive forms, preserving exact semantics.
   - Eliminate redundant or unreachable code only if proven not to change any external behavior or output.
   - Avoid introducing any new language constructs, libraries, or paradigms outside those inferable from the original pseudocode's style and idioms.

3. **Produce no explanatory text, no comments, no annotations, no examples—only output the transformed pseudocode itself.**

4. Ensure the rewritten pseudocode remains independently executable and self-sufficient for the intended logic it implements.

Your goal: generate an alternative pseudocode source as **orthogonal and distinct as possible from the original**, optimized for **zero semantic drift and maximal syntactic originality** within the strict naming and structural identity constraints described above.
