Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation, keeping it compact and high-level. Produce only the pseudocode without any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations. Use mostly one-liners, abbreviations, and loops or conditions in minimal form. Follow this numbered format exactly:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should be structured clearly and simply, aiming for clarity within a 5-second generation timeout.
