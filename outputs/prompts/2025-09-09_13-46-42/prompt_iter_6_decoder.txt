Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, syntactically correct, and idiomatic Python function or class implementation, strictly preserving the original function names and signatures. Your translation must:

- Enclose the entire Python code within a single markdown code block using triple backticks and the language identifier `python`, for example:

```python
# Your complete Python code here
```

- Optimize for both clarity and performance, ensuring your solution can execute correctly within a 5-second runtime limit.

- Include any necessary imports or helper classes if implied by the pseudocode.

- Avoid adding explanations, comments, or extraneous output unless specifically requested.

- Use Pythonâ€™s standard libraries or common built-in features but do not rely on external or uncommon packages.

- Handle edge cases as implied by the pseudocode, maintaining the logic and intent exactly.

This approach aims to produce ready-to-run, high-quality Python code faithfully derived from the pseudocode, suitable for direct testing and integration.
