Generate clear, concise, and easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description.  
- Use mostly natural language with standard symbolic notations and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level.  
- Keep all original function names exactly as in the source code.  
- Prefer brief one-line statements, simple loops, and conditionals written inline when possible.  
- Format each step as a numbered line starting at 1, following exactly this style:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

- Do not add purpose, summary, explanations, or clarifying notes; output only pseudocode.  
- Avoid separator lines, extra formatting, or extraneous characters.  
- Describe data structures and operations with simple terms like "list", "map", "array", and use standard operators.  
- Reflect control flow and logic in a straightforward, intuitive way, combining natural language with symbols for maximum clarity and brevity.  

Example style to follow:  
in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
