Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description, keeping the original function name unchanged. Write clear, natural-language steps that are compact yet precise. Use symbolic notation and standard abbreviations where helpful to minimize verbosity. Prefer one-liners, simple loops, and conditionals. Present only the pseudocode itself—no explanations, summaries, comments, or clarifications. Follow this exact numbering and formatting style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode is easy to read and understand within a 5-second generation limit, balancing brevity and clarity without using separator lines or extra formatting elements.
