Generate concise, compact pseudocode for the given problem description preserving the **original function name**. Make the pseudocode easy to read and understand by using clear natural language mixed with symbolic notation and abbreviations to keep it high-level and succinct. Prefer one-line statements and simple loops or conditionals to reduce verbosity. Do **not** include purpose, summaries, comments, explanations, or overview statements—output only the pseudocode itself. Keep the structure consistent and straightforward, following this numbering and formatting style exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use short variable names where appropriate, but maintain clarity. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. The pseudocode should be compact, focus purely on logic, and fit within a 5-second generation timeout.
