Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use compact, high-level steps with natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where helpful. Present the pseudocode without purpose, summary, overview statements, or clarifying notes—output only the pseudocode itself. Prefer one-liners and simple loops or conditionals. Follow this numbering and formatting style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Your pseudocode should focus on clarity and brevity, suitable for a 5-second generation timeout.
