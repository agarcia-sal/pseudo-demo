Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code, strictly preserving all class names, method names, and class/object structures exactly as presented in the pseudocode.

- Wrap your entire code in a single Python code block formatted as:
```python
# Your complete translated code here
```
- Maintain function and class definitions with identical names and signatures as the pseudocode.
- Implement all logic faithfully, ensuring correctness and clarity.
- Optimize the translated code for both readability and performance, mindful that the code must execute within a 5-second timeout.
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries if they improve efficiency or clarity.
- Do not include any explanations or comments outside the code block.
- Avoid adding unrelated code, testing harnesses, or example usage.

Focus on precise translation, structural fidelity, and executable correctness to maximize the quality and reliability of the output.
