Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that captures the core logic. Use natural language mixed with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Structure pseudocode as numbered steps using one-liners where possible. Do not include purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanatory notes—only pseudocode. Follow the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Make pseudocode high-level and compact, avoiding unnecessary detail. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize accordingly.
