Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and optimized Python code, strictly preserving all original class names, method signatures, and function names exactly as stated in the pseudocode. Your translation must use the same class and object structure and method names without modification. Enclose your entire solution within a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Ensure the code is syntactically correct, efficient, and performs optimally within a 5-second runtime constraint. You may leverage any Python standard library or third-party package if it helps improve clarity or performance. Do not include any explanations, comments, or text outside the Python code block. Output only the Python code block.
