Translate the following pseudocode into efficient, clean, and fully functional Python code. Adhere strictly to these guidelines:

- Preserve all class names, function names, signatures, and the overall structure exactly as given in the pseudocode.
- Include all functions within their respective classes or modules as shown.
- Implement all logic accurately and idiomatically in Python, prioritizing correctness, readability, and performance (meeting a 5-second runtime constraint).
- You may utilize any standard Python libraries or packages if they improve clarity or efficiency.
- Enclose only the complete resulting Python code inside a single properly formatted code block:

```python
# Your complete translated code here
```

- Do NOT include any explanations, comments outside the code block, or extra text.
- Avoid placeholder code; the code must be runnable and faithful to the pseudocode semantics and intent.
