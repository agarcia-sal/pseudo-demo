Translate the given pseudocode into correct, clean, and efficient Python code, strictly preserving all class names, method names, argument names, and the overall class/object structure exactly as shown in the pseudocode. Your implementation must fit within a single Python code block, formatted as:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Adhere to the following requirements:

- Preserve all class and function definitions exactly as in the pseudocode (names, signatures, indentation).
- Convert all pseudocode control flow, assignments, and logic accurately into Python syntax.
- Include any helper functions as inner methods if indicated, maintaining their placement and scope.
- Use Python standard library only, but optimize for clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiency (target under 5 seconds).
- Do not add, remove, or rename functions/classes beyond what pseudocode specifies.
- Do not include any explanatory text or comments outside the code block.
- Your submission must contain only the precisely translated code inside the single fenced python block.

Focus on faithfully implementing and encapsulating the logic, ensuring well-structured, executable, and correct Python code that strictly follows the pseudocodeâ€™s class and function layouts with no deviation.
