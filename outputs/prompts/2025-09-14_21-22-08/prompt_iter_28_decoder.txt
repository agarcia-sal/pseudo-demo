Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, clean Python code that exactly preserves all class names, method names, signatures, and object structures as described in the pseudocode. Your implementation must:

- Enclose the entire code within a single Python code block formatted as:
```python
# Your translated code here
```
- Match function and class names exactly as in the pseudocode without renaming or restructuring.
- Include any helper or nested functions exactly as indicated by the pseudocode structure.
- Ensure the code is syntactically correct and optimized for clarity and performance while respecting a 5-second runtime limit.
- Use appropriate Python standard libraries if needed, but avoid unnecessary imports.
- Avoid any print statements, comments not related to code clarity, or extra text outside the code block.
- Make no assumptions beyond the pseudocode provided and do not add code unrelated to the pseudocode logic.

Your task is to produce the most accurate, efficient Python translation of the input pseudocode that can be directly runnable and testable in the intended environment.
