Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code. Strictly preserve all class names, method names, and their nesting and object structures as indicated in the pseudocode. Implement all functions and methods faithfully with the exact signatures shown. Your code must execute correctly within a 5-second time limit and be optimized for clarity, correctness, and performance. Use Python standard libraries or well-known third-party packages if they improve efficiency and readability. Enclose your entire solution in one Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# Your complete translated code here
```

Do not include any explanations, comments beyond necessary inline clarifications, or any text outside the code block. Ensure the output code is ready to run and passes typical validity tests based on the pseudocode provided.
