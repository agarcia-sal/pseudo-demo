Translate the given pseudocode into fully working, clean, and efficient Python code.  
- Preserve all class names, method names, and the exact class/object hierarchical structure as specified in the pseudocode.
- Implement all functions and helper methods inside their respective classes as indicated, with the same signatures.
- Your entire output must be enclosed within a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

- Optimize the code for clarity, correctness, and performance given a strict 5-second runtime limit.
- It's permitted to use any standard Python library if it improves efficiency, but do not import unnecessary modules.
- Do not output anything besides the Python code blockâ€”no explanations, comments, or extra text.
- Ensure your code is self-contained and free from runtime errors, name collisions, or undefined references.
