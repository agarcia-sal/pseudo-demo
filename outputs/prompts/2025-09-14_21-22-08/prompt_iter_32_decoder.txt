Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-organized, and efficient Python code that strictly follows the original class names, function names, and overall structure as presented in the pseudocode. Return the full implementation in a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Adhere to these requirements precisely:
- Preserve all class and method names exactly as in the pseudocode.
- Implement any helper functions as shown, nested or standalone, maintaining their intended scope.
- Write performant code optimized for clarity, correctness, and to run within a 5-second timeout.
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries if they help improve clarity or efficiency.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or text outside the code block.
- Do not alter method signatures or the structure of classes beyond what is necessary for correct Python syntax.
- Assume that the pseudocode logic and variable names are correct; do not change algorithmic logic unless correcting clear errors for a valid Python implementation.

Strictly output only the fully working and syntactically valid Python code enclosed in the Python code block as shown above, nothing else.
