Translate the given pseudocode into clean, optimized Python code, strictly preserving all original function names, class names, and their enclosing class and object structures as shown in the pseudocode. Your solution must:

- Be contained entirely within a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

- Use idiomatic, efficient Python constructs and standard or widely accepted libraries if they help improve clarity or performance.

- Correctly implement all control flows, variable assignments, loops, and helper functions exactly as described.

- Avoid adding any comments, explanations, print statements, or code outside the code block.

- Ensure your code runs correctly and efficiently within a 5-second timeout, suitable for direct execution and testing.

- Retain the exact method signatures and class structure as specified, without alteration.

- Handle edge cases implicitly as per the pseudocode logic without requiring explicit instructions.

Produce only the final Python code blockâ€”no additional text or formatting outside the block.
