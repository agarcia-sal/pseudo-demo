Translate the following pseudocode into fully working, clean, and performant Python code. Strictly preserve all class names, method names, signatures, and nesting as given in the pseudocode. Use the exact class and function structure shown, including the class `Solution` if present.

- Enclose your entire solution in a single Python code block formatted exactly as:
  ```python
  # Your translated code here
  ```
- Your code must be syntactically correct, ready to run without modification, and optimized for clarity and efficiency within a 5-second execution constraint.
- You may use any standard Python library or package to enhance efficiency and readability.
- **Do not** add any explanation, comments, or extra text outside the code block.
- Carefully translate pseudocode syntax and operations to Python equivalents, including loops, conditionals, assignments, functions, and variable scopes.
- If the pseudocode defines helper functions (e.g., `expandFromCenter`), ensure they are correctly implemented and nested as shown (e.g., inside class methods).
- Be mindful of common pitfalls such as off-by-one errors, correct indexing, and data structures consistent with the pseudocode.
- Return exactly what the pseudocode specifiesâ€”no extra prints or debug output.

Now, transform the pseudocode into the requested Python implementation, strictly following these instructions.
