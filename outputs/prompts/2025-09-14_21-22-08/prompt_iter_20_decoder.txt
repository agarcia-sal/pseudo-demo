Translate the given pseudocode into clear, well-structured, and optimized Python code, strictly preserving all class names, function names, signatures, and class/object structures exactly as stated in the pseudocode. Your code should fully implement the logic implied by the pseudocode, be efficient enough to run within a 5-second timeout, and be ready to handle typical inputs without errors.

Enclose your entire answer in a single Python code block formatted exactly like this:

```python
# your complete translated code here
```

Do NOT include any explanation, comments beyond minimal inline clarifications if necessary for correctness, or text outside the code block. Use only standard libraries or widely accepted packages if absolutely needed for improved efficiency or clarity. Avoid dummy implementations and ensure the code is executable as-is for testing.
