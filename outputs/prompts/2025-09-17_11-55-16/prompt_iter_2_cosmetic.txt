Rewrite the input pseudocode to produce a functionally equivalent version that differs maximally in syntax, structure, naming conventions (except function and class names), control flow constructs, and expression style, while strictly preserving all original functionality. Do not alter function names or class names, nor change the class or object hierarchy or their relationships. Employ different algorithmic idioms, modularization, data representations, and code organization strategies to maximize syntactic and stylistic divergence. Avoid any explanatory text or commentaryâ€”output only the transformed pseudocode.
