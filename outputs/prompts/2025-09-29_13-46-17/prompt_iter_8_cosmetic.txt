Given input pseudocode, generate a semantically identical rewrite that **maximally diverges syntactically, structurally, and stylistically** from the original pseudocode, while strictly preserving:

- All **function and class names**, exactly as originally given.
- Original **function signatures**, parameter names and order.
- All **class declarations, inheritance, nesting, and object hierarchies** exactly as in the input (no additions, removals, or reorderings).

**Output ONLY the complete rewritten pseudocode—no explanations, comments, or annotations of any kind.**

To achieve maximal dissimilarity, recursively and comprehensively apply deep, layered, and interacting transformations across all dimensions of the code, including but not limited to:

1. **Control Flow Transformation:**
   - Convert all loops to recursive or tail-recursive equivalents, or vice versa.
   - Replace if-else chains with guard clauses, pattern matching, early returns, dispatch tables, polymorphic methods, or boolean short-circuit logic.
   - Desugar or reconstruct all switch/case logic into nested ifs, and alternatively rebuild nested ifs into switch/case forms.
   - Apply loop unrolling, fusion, splitting, or convert implicit iteration (e.g., comprehensions) into explicit iteration constructs.

2. **Identifier Obfuscation and Renaming:**
   - Rename all local variables, parameters (except those in function signatures), loop indices, and temporary identifiers to fresh, semantically opaque tokens using varied inconsistent schemes (random strings, mixed casing, thematic but unrelated names), ensuring **no semantic hint or resemblance** to original names.
   - Do NOT rename or modify function or class names.

3. **Data Structure Reinterpretation:**
   - Replace arrays, lists, sets, maps, queues, stacks, and other collections interchangeably wherever semantics allow.
   - Convert index-based traversals into iterator-based, enumerator, or recursive traversals, and vice versa.
   - Re-express data accumulations using folds, explicit accumulators, recursion, monadic chaining, or functional pipelines.

4. **Expression and Boolean Logic Rewriting:**
   - Systematically apply Boolean algebra transformations (De Morgan’s laws, contraposition, distributivity, absorption) to all conditionals and logical expressions.
   - Algebraically expand, factor, or rewrite arithmetic expressions (e.g., exponentials as loops, constants as computed expressions).
   - Recast conditionals into boolean arithmetic, ternary expressions, pattern matches, or predicate-based dispatch.

5. **Structural and Modular Rearrangement:**
   - Inline or extract repeated code into new helper functions with new names and varied nesting levels.
   - Reorder independent statements aggressively respecting data dependencies.
   - Flatten or deepen nested blocks; restructure code blocks and group or split statement sequences.

6. **State and Result Handling Variants:**
   - Replace mutable state updates with chains of immutable rebinding or pure functional transformations.
   - Alternate between early returns, accumulators, flags, or result objects for output propagation.
   - Restructure return statements and output aggregation to produce dramatically different control flow visuals without semantic change.

7. **Syntactic and Formatting Variation:**
   - Aggressively vary indentation style and width, line breaks, statement grouping, delimiters, and whitespace usage, conforming to valid pseudocode grammar.
   - Remove absolutely all comments, annotations, and docstrings.
   - Substitute idiomatic idioms with valid alternative pseudocode constructs (e.g., list comprehensions rewritten as explicit loops or recursive constructs).

8. **Advanced Paradigmatic Substitutions:**
   - Employ polymorphic dispatch, pattern matching, higher-order functions, monadic-style chains, or accumulator-passing style wherever valid.
   - Transform procedural code into functional style and vice versa, provided semantics remain identical.
   - Use explicit enumerations or generators to replace index-based loops and vice versa.

**Combine and nest these transformations recursively and exhaustively throughout the entire pseudocode—superficial or partial rewrites are insufficient.**

**Strictly:**

- Do NOT change function or class names or signatures.
- Do NOT add, remove, or rename any functions, methods, or classes.
- Do NOT change any external behavior, outputs, or side effects.
- Do NOT introduce new libraries, language constructs, or external dependencies beyond valid pseudocode.
- Do NOT output anything other than the full transformed pseudocode.

The output must be the fully rewritten pseudocode snippet alone, ready to replace the original.
