Given the pseudocode as input, generate a version of the pseudocode that preserves all original functionality but is as different as possible in structure, style, and expression. Keep the same function names and class names exactly as in the original, maintaining the original class and object hierarchy without changes. Output only the rewritten pseudocode with no explanations or additional text.
