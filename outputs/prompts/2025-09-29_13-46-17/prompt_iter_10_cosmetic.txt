Given any pseudocode snippet as input, produce a fully rewritten, semantically identical pseudocode output that exhibits **maximal and deeply pervasive divergence** from the original across *all* syntactic, stylistic, structural, and idiomatic dimensions, while rigidly adhering to these constraints:

- Preserve **all function names and exact signatures** (including parameter names and order) without modification.
- Retain **all class names** and **all class definitions and nesting structures** exactly as in the input; no classes, interfaces, or objects may be added, removed, reordered, or renamed.
- Strictly maintain original **external behavior**, outputs, side effects, and data semantics—your rewrite must be fully equivalent in meaning.
- Do **not** add, remove, or reorder any functions, methods, or classes.
- Use **only valid pseudocode constructs**; do not introduce any new language features or libraries beyond common pseudocode norms.
- Your output must be **only** the transformed pseudocode; exclude any explanations, comments, or annotations.

To achieve the above, comprehensively apply a multifaceted, recursively nested, and semantically preserving metamorphosis on every relevant code fragment and construct. Combine and deeply interleave from (but not limited to) the following advanced transformation strategies:

1. **Exhaustive Control Flow Recasting:**  
   - Convert iterative constructs fully into recursive or continuation-passing-style equivalents; conversely, convert recursion into equivalent iterative or fold patterns, even mutual or tail recursion variants.  
   - Decompose complex conditionals into chains of guard clauses, nested if/else, switch-like dispatch tables, pattern matching forms, or polymorphic-style dispatch logic, ensuring frequent cross-style nonlinear re-expression.  
   - Rewrite all boolean logic with repeated application of Boolean algebra identities (De Morgan, distributive laws, absorption, contraposition, negation-pushing, dualities), transforming conditions into logically equivalent but distinct textual and structural formulations.  
   - Re-architect nested loops via loop fusion, fission, unrolling, flattening, or accumulation folds, altering traversal and iteration orders without affecting semantics.

2. **Opaque, Multi-Paradigm Identifier Renaming:**  
   - Rename *every* non-global identifier—local variables, parameters, temporaries, iterators—to fresh, nonsensical symbols or tokens drawn from heterogenous schemes including randomized alphanumeric sequences, Unicode glyphs, phonetic codenames, emojis, mixed casing, and arbitrary symbol strings.  
   - Maintain **distinct per-scope naming maps** with no mnemonic relationship to original identifiers or across scopes.  
   - Leave all function and class names exactly as given, with matching signatures.

3. **Data Structure and Access Pattern Transformation:**  
   - Substitute compatible data structures freely (arrays ↔ lists ↔ queues ↔ sets ↔ maps), rewriting element access, traversal (index-based, iterator-driven, recursive enumeration), and aggregation paradigms accordingly.  
   - Express traversals via recursive enumerators, generators, explicit iterators, or functional pipeline constructs (map/filter/fold), diversifying access style.

4. **Expression, Arithmetic, and Boolean Reformation:**  
   - Rewrite arithmetic expressions into algebraically or procedurally equivalent forms (e.g., replace exponentiation by explicit multiplication loops or recursion; constants expressed via arithmetic identities or chained computations).  
   - Reformulate logical expressions explicitly across multiple normal forms (CNF, DNF), boolean arithmetic, ternary conditionals, or pattern matching decisions, systematically permuting operands.

5. **Program and Code Structure Reorganization:**  
   - Inline all called functions fully where feasible or introduce brand new helper functions with completely unrelated, random naming to factor out repeated code segments, alternating nesting levels arbitrarily.  
   - Restructure code blocks extensively—flatten deeply nested scopes or deepen shallow ones, reorder independent statements liberally without semantic violation.  
   - Replace standard block delimiters and statement terminators with syntactically valid but uncommon pseudocode variants differing from the original style.

6. **State and Flow Management Innovations:**  
   - Refactor mutable state manipulation into chains of immutable data flow assignments or purely functional transformations.  
   - Employ diverse control flow mechanisms: flag variables, early returns, exclusive pathing, exception-like idiomatic flows, continuation-passing style, or data-carrying accumulators restructured as tuples or objects.  
   - Repackage return values in alternative forms (tuples, records, accumulators) and rewrite aggregation flows accordingly.

7. **Formatting and Syntax Diversification:**  
   - Aggressively vary whitespace, indentation schemes (spaces, tabs, irregular widths, staggered or misaligned), line breaks, and statement grouping styles, maximizing formatting distinction.  
   - Replace punctuation, delimiters, and block markers with semantically equivalent but syntactically distinct alternatives valid in pseudocode, ensuring no trailing or inline comments remain.  
   - Mix declarative and imperative expression styles and reorder parameter passing within calls where allowed.

8. **Complete Paradigmatic Overhaul:**  
   - Translate imperative constructs into declarative or functional paradigms and vice versa.  
   - Replace explicit indexing with recursion or higher-order functional traversals; substitute imperative loops with pattern matching or pipeline-based computations, monadic chains, or explicit state threading.  
   - Where applicable, model control flows using diverse paradigms (e.g., backtracking, continuation passing, state monads) expressed idiomatically in pseudocode.

Apply these transformations **exhaustively and recursively at all levels of nesting**—functions, methods, classes, blocks, expressions, and control flows—aiming for radical textual and structural divergence while maintaining perfect semantic fidelity.

**Output only the complete transformed pseudocode**, no explanatory text.
