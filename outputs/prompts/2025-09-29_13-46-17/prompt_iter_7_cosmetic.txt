Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce a fully semantically equivalent rewriting that **maximizes syntactic and structural divergence** from the original, subject to the strict preservation of:

- All original **function and class names**, exactly as given,
- Original **function signatures** (names, parameters, and their order),
- Original **class declarations, inheritance, and nesting hierarchies** intact (no additions, removals, or rearrangements).

Your output must be **only** the complete transformed pseudocode, with no explanations or annotations.

To achieve maximal dissimilarity, apply **deep, multi-layered, and mutually reinforcing transformations** at all levels—control flow, data structures, variable naming, expression form, and code organization—combining techniques such as but not limited to:

1. **Control Flow Reconfiguration:**

   - Replace all iterative constructs with equivalent recursive or tail-recursive forms, or vice versa.
   - Substitute conditional branches combining if-else chains, guard clauses, early returns, pattern matching, dispatch tables, logical short-circuiting, or polymorphic dispatch.
   - Desugar or reconstruct switch/case-style logic into nested ifs, and vice versa.
   - Expand or contract loops via loop unrolling or loop fusion; convert loops to explicit enumerations or iterator protocols.

2. **Identifier Transformations:**

   - Systematically rename every **local variable**, **parameter**, and **temporary identifier** in every scope to fresh, semantically opaque and distinct identifiers using varied and inconsistent naming schemes (e.g., random alphanumeric strings, thematic codes, mixed casing styles, non-meaningful substitutions) with **no semantic overlap or hints** linking to original identifiers.
   - Reuse original **function and class names exactly**, without change.

3. **Data Structure Replacements:**

   - Substitute arrays, lists, sets, queues, maps, or other collections for one another wherever semantics permit.
   - Convert index-based iteration to iterator protocols or recursive traversal.
   - Represent accumulations alternately via different paradigms: folds, reduces, explicit accumulators, or recursion.

4. **Expression and Logic Rewrites:**

   - Apply Boolean algebra extensively: De Morgan’s laws, contraposition, distributivity, absorption, and associative rearrangements to reorder and rewrite all logical expressions.
   - Expand, factor, or otherwise algebraically transform all arithmetic expressions; replace exponentiation with iterative or recursive multiplication; convert numeric constants to computations or symbolic expressions.
   - Re-express conditionals and boolean checks using boolean arithmetic, conditional expressions (ternaries), or pattern matching.

5. **Structural Rearrangements:**

   - Inline functions or extract repeated code into newly introduced helper functions with varied and different nesting depths and naming.
   - Reorganize, reorder, or regroup statements to alter block structure, balancing between flattening and deepening nested scopes.
   - Alter order of independent statements, respecting semantic dependencies strictly.

6. **State and Flow Management:**

   - Replace mutable variables with chains of immutable reassignment or pure functional transformations.
   - Alternate between early returns, accumulators, control flags, or result objects to propagate outputs.
   - Alter return statement structures and result aggregation logic to drastically transform control flow readability without changing behavior.

7. **Formatting and Syntax Variation:**

   - Aggressively vary indentation style (spaces vs. tabs), indent widths, line breaking, statement grouping.
   - Change delimiters, punctuation, and whitespace patterns respecting pseudocode grammar to maximize textual divergence.
   - Remove all comments, docstrings, or annotations.

8. **Idiomatic Construct Substitution:**

   - Replace idiomatic pseudocode features with alternative, valid constructs (e.g., substitute explicit loops with pattern matching or higher-order function analogues, or express logic using boolean short-circuit arithmetic).
   - Employ explicit enumerations, accumulator passing styles, or monadic-style chaining wherever valid.

**Combine and nest these transformations extensively and recursively throughout the pseudocode rather than applying them superficially.**

**Do not**:

- Change any function or class names or signatures.
- Alter any external behavior, outputs, side effects, or data semantics.
- Add or remove any functions, classes, or methods.
- Introduce any new libraries or language constructs beyond valid pseudocode norms.

**Only output the full transformed pseudocode. Nothing else.**
