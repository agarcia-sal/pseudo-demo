Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully executable Python code, preserving all original function and class names exactly as in the pseudocode. Your translation should include all necessary imports and any helper classes or functions implied by the pseudocode. Make sure to:

- Properly define all classes and methods (e.g., include `self` in class methods).
- Use correct Python syntax, including typing hints if applicable.
- Handle common edge cases (e.g., empty inputs) explicitly as indicated.
- Replace any pseudocode placeholders or symbols (like `null`) with valid Python equivalents (`None`).
- Avoid introducing any undefined names or references.
- Format the code for readability and maintainability.
- Enclose the entire code in a single Python code block, specifying the language exactly as:

```python
# Your fully functional translated Python code here
```

Do not include any separator lines or explanations outside of the code block. Your solution must be ready to run and test directly, completing within a 5-second time budget while prioritizing correctness and clarity.
