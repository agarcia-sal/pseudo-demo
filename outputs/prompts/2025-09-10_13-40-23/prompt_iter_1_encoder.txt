Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic operators and abbreviations. The pseudocode should be compact and high-level, avoiding detailed explanations, comments, or overview statements—only the pseudocode itself. Prefer one-liners where possible. Follow this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Your pseudocode should name functions, variables, and control flow clearly yet succinctly, prioritizing clarity and brevity.

You have a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
