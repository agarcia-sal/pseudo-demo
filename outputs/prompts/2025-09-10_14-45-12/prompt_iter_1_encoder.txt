Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Use natural language combined with symbolic notation, favor one-liners, abbreviations, and high-level steps. Follow this format with numbered lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and brevity, avoiding unnecessary detail. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
