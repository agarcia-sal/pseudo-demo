Given a problem description, generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode that is high-level and uses natural language, one-liners, symbolic operators, and abbreviations. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—just the pseudocode itself. Format steps numbered with concise assignments and control structures, e.g.:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for compactness, clarity, and readability. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
