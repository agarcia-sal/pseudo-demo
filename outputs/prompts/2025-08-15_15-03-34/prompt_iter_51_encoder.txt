Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description, using natural language combined with familiar symbolic operators and standard control structures (if, else, for, while, function, return). Express algorithmic logic compactly, preferring mostly one-liners and minimal nesting. Use descriptive but succinct variable names and standard data structure references, avoiding verbose phrasing or filler. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, exactly in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Omit all explanations, comments, summaries, or extraneous notes—output only the pseudocode steps fully capturing the algorithm’s flow and logic. Do not include unnecessary initialization or implementation details not essential for understanding or re-implementation. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Ensure pseudocode is self-contained, readable, and directly translatable to code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
