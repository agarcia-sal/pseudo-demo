Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is compact, readable, and uses natural language mixed with standard symbolic operators and control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Favor mostly one-liners and minimal nesting; use clear, descriptive variable names but no verbose explanations or filler words. Number each line sequentially starting at 1 in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Include essential algorithmic steps only—omit any details unnecessary for correct understanding or direct re-implementation. Avoid comments, summaries, or notes; output only self-contained pseudocode that fully captures the logic and flow, suitable for immediate comprehension and translation into code. Do not use separator lines or extra formatting. Complete output within 5 seconds.
