Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Prefer one-liners and a compact, high-level style. Follow this numbering format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

The pseudocode should clearly represent the logic and flow without unnecessary detail. Your function must complete within 5 seconds.
