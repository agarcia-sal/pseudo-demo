Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is clear and easy to understand. Use mostly natural language enriched with common symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return), expressing logic compactly in mostly one-liner statements with minimal nesting. Employ descriptive, natural variable names and simple data structure references without verbose wording or filler. Number each pseudocode line starting at 1, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include any comments, explanations, notes, summaries, or purpose statements—output only the necessary pseudocode lines fully capturing the algorithm’s logic and flow. Omit any nonessential initialization or details unrelated to direct comprehension or implementation. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. The output should be a self-contained, compact pseudocode block suitable for immediate understanding and translation into code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
