Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly one-liners, minimal nesting, and mix natural language with common symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Prefer descriptive but brief variable names and standard data structure expressions without verbosity. Number each pseudocode line starting at 1, strictly following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or any notes—output only the precise pseudocode steps needed to fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow, with no extraneous initialization or details beyond what’s essential for correct understanding or direct translation into code. Do not include separator lines or extra formatting. Make the pseudocode self-contained, compact, and high-level, suitable for quick comprehension and implementation. Finish output within 5 seconds.
