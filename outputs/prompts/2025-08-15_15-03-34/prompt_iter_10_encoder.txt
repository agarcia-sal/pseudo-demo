Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly natural language with selective symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return), favoring one-liner statements and minimal nesting. Use clear, descriptive variable and function names with simple, direct data structure references and abbreviations where appropriate to keep the pseudocode compact. Number each line sequentially from 1 with this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode steps needed to fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow without explanations, comments, summaries, or extraneous details. Omit any separator lines or extra formatting. Ensure the pseudocode is self-contained, straightforward, and precise, suitable for quick comprehension and direct translation into code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
