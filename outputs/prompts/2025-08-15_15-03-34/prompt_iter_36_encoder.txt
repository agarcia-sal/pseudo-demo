Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is compact, easy to read, and understandable. Use mostly one-line statements combining natural language with common symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return), employing abbreviations and minimal nesting. Use descriptive but concise variable names and standard data structure terms without verbosity. Number each pseudocode line sequentially starting from 1, following exactly this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode steps necessary to fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow without explanations, comments, summaries, or extra notes. Omit any details or initializations not strictly needed for a clear, correct algorithm understanding. Do not include separator lines or additional formatting. Produce self-contained, readable pseudocode that can be directly mapped to code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
