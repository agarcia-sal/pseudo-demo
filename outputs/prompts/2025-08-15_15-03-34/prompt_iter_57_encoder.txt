Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to follow and understand. Use mostly one-line statements combining natural language with common symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Use descriptive but succinct variable names and simple data structure references. Structure the pseudocode with minimal nesting and avoid verbose wording or filler. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, using this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode lines directly capturing the algorithm’s logic and essential steps for re-implementation. Omit any details that are not strictly necessary for correct understanding. Do not use separator lines or extra formatting. Ensure the pseudocode is self-contained, compact, high-level, and suitable for immediate comprehension and direct translation to code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
