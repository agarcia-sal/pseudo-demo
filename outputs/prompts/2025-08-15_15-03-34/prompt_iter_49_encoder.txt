Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly one-line statements combining natural language with standard symbolic operators and common control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return, let, set), minimizing nesting and verbosity. Choose meaningful yet compact variable names and simple data structure references without filler or redundant phrasing. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or any notes—output only the essential pseudocode steps that fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow suitable for direct implementation. Omit unnecessary initialization or details not required for clear understanding or re-implementation. Do not include separator lines or extra formatting. Emphasize a natural, readable style that is concise and self-contained, producing output within 5 seconds.
