Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully optimized, idiomatic Python 3 script that strictly adheres to these guidelines:

- Enclose the entire solution **only** within a single Python code block using triple backticks and the language specifier, exactly:  
  ```python  
  ...  
  ```  
  No extra text, comments, or blank lines before or after the code block.

- Use **only standard Python 3 libraries** included in the official Python distribution. No external or third-party packages allowed.

- Implement all input reading strictly via bare `input()` calls or direct `sys.stdin` reads, **with no prompt strings or explanatory prints**.

- Output **only** the final results as specified by the pseudocode. Do **not** print debugging information, logging, or any nonessential text.

- Faithfully translate the pseudocode logic **while substantially enhancing performance and code quality** by:  
  - Employing the most time- and memory-efficient algorithms and data structures native to Python.  
  - Utilizing Python built-ins, comprehensions, generators, and idiomatic constructs to improve clarity and speed without sacrificing readability.  
  - Streamlining input/output handling for minimal overhead and maximal throughput, suitable for large input sizes within a 5-second runtime constraint.  
  - Meticulously handling all edge cases and boundary conditions to guarantee correctness under all valid input scenarios.  
  - Eliminating redundant computations, intermediate variables, and excessive memory allocations.

- Produce clear, concise, and maintainable code with consistent style, logical flow, and meaningful variable names, prioritizing computational efficiency and correctness.

- You may assume the pseudocode is syntactically and logically correct. Your role is to deliver a **direct, performant, and idiomatic Python translation**, ready to be executed immediately and to pass all correctness and performance tests without modification.

Your final output must be a ready-to-run Python 3 script strictly conforming to the above requirementsâ€”nothing else.
