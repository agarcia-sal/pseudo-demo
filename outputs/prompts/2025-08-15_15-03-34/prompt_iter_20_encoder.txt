Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description, using mostly one-liner statements that combine natural language with standard symbolic and control-flow constructs (if, else, for, while, function, return). Use descriptive natural variable names and simple, common data structure references without verbosity. Minimize nesting and avoid unnecessary details or initializations not essential for understanding or reimplementation. Number each pseudocode line sequentially starting at 1, using this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or separator lines. Provide only the pseudocode steps needed to fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow in a compact, self-contained form suitable for direct translation into code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
