Generate clear, compact, and high-level pseudocode directly from the given problem description, using mostly one-line statements that combine natural language with standard symbolic operators and control keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Use concise and descriptive variable names and simple data structure references without verbose phrasing or filler words. Minimize nesting and avoid unnecessary detail. Number every line sequentially starting from 1 in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or notes — output only the essential pseudocode lines that fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow, suitable for straightforward re-implementation. Omit any initialization or detail not required for correct understanding. Do not use separator lines or extra formatting. Ensure output is self-contained, readable, and efficiently expresses the solution in under 5 seconds.
