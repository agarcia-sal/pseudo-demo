Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is clear, readable, and compact by combining natural language and common symbolic operators. Use mostly one-line instructions with standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return), minimal nesting, and natural descriptive variable names. Avoid verbose phrasing—express data structures and operations simply and directly. Number each line sequentially starting at 1 in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode statements that fully capture the algorithm’s logic for correct implementation. Exclude any unnecessary initialization or irrelevant details. Do not add separator lines or extra formatting. Ensure the pseudocode is self-contained and sufficiently compact for easy comprehension and direct translation into code. Complete the output within 5 seconds.
