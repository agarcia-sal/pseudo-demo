Generate concise, high-level, and readable pseudocode that captures the full algorithmic logic using a natural-language style blended with common symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Prefer mostly one-liners and minimal nesting. Use descriptive but succinct variable names and simple data structure references without verbose phrases or filler. Number each line starting at 1 in this exact format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or anything outside the pseudocode itself. Omit any unnecessary initialization or detail that does not affect correctness or clarity. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. The output must be self-contained, compact, and suitable for direct reading and implementation. Complete the output within 5 seconds.
