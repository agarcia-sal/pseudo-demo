Generate compact, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly one-line statements combining natural language with standard symbolic operators and common control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Prefer concise, clear variable names and simple data structure references without verbose phrasing. Minimize nesting and repetitive phrases. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, using this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or notes. Output only the essential pseudocode steps that fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow, omitting any extraneous initialization or details unnecessary for correct understanding or implementation. Avoid separators or extra formatting. Ensure the pseudocode is self-contained, readable, and concise enough for direct translation into code. Complete the output within 5 seconds.
