Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly one-liner steps combining natural language with standard symbolic operators and control keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Use descriptive yet compact variable names and simple data structure references without fillers or verbose phrasing. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or extra notes—output only the pseudocode fully capturing the algorithm’s logic and flow needed for implementation. Omit any unnecessary initialization or details not essential to the main logic. Do not include separator lines or additional formatting. Produce pseudocode that is self-contained, elegant, and suitable for direct interpretation or coding. Complete output within 5 seconds.
