Generate concise, compact, and high-level pseudocode directly from the problem description, emphasizing readability and clarity with minimal verbosity. Use clear natural language combined with common symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Prefer one-line statements, minimal nesting, and natural yet concise variable and data structure names. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, exactly as follows:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, notes, summaries, or any formatting besides line numbering—output only the pseudocode steps that fully capture the algorithm’s logic for straightforward re-implementation. Omit any initialization or detail irrelevant to core understanding. Do not include separator lines or extra spacing. The pseudocode must be self-contained, elegant, and suitable for both quick comprehension and direct translation into code. Complete within 5 seconds.
