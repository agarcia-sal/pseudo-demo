Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly one-liners combining natural language, symbolic operators, and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return), favoring minimal nesting and compact expressions. Use descriptive but succinct variable names and straightforward data structure references without extra verbosity. Number each pseudocode line starting at 1, exactly in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode statements that fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow, omitting explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or unnecessary initialization details. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Produce self-contained pseudocode that is both succinct and directly translatable into code. Prefer natural language phrasing while keeping brevity and clarity. Complete output within 5 seconds.
