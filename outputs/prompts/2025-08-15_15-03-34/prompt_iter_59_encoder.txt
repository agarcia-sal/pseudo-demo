Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is clear, compact, and easy to read. Use mostly one-liners with minimal nesting, combining natural language and common symbols (←, =, %, //, etc.) and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Prefer descriptive yet succinct variable names and standard data structure notation without verbose explanations or filler.

Number each pseudocode line starting at 1, in this exact format:
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, summaries, notes, or explanations. Output only the pseudocode steps that fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow, omitting any unnecessary initialization or irrelevant details. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting.

Structure the pseudocode at a level suitable for direct code translation: abstract enough to be compact, but specific enough to reconstruct the algorithm unambiguously. Output should complete within 5 seconds.
