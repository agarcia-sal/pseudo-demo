Generate clear, concise pseudocode that captures the complete algorithm from the problem description in a highly readable, compact, and high-level style. Use mostly one-line statements mixing natural language with common symbolic operators and standard keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return, let, set, read, print). Use descriptive, natural variable and function names with simple data structure references, avoiding filler or verbose phrasing. Structure control flow with minimal nesting and prefer sequential, straightforward steps. Number all lines sequentially starting at 1, using this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, explanations, notes, or summaries—output only the algorithmic steps needed to fully implement the logic. Exclude any irrelevant initialization or unnecessary details. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. The output pseudocode should be fully self-contained, succinct, and ready for direct translation into code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
