Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that captures the full algorithmic logic clearly and compactly. Use natural language closely blended with common symbolic operators and standard control keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Prefer mostly one-liner statements and minimal nesting. Use intuitive, descriptive variable names and simple data structure references without filler or verbose phrasing. Number each line sequentially from 1 in this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode lines—no explanations, comments, summaries, or formatting lines. Exclude any redundant initialization or details unnecessary for correct understanding and re-implementation. Avoid separator lines or extra indentation beyond minimal clarity. Produce self-contained, compact pseudocode suitable for direct comprehension and translation. Complete output within 5 seconds.
