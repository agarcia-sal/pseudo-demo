Generate clear, compact, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description using mostly concise natural language mixed with standard symbolic operators and control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return).  
Use descriptive but brief variable names; prefer one-liner statements and minimal nesting.  
Number each pseudocode line starting at 1 in this exact format:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Avoid any explanations, comments, summaries, or clarifications—output only the minimal set of steps necessary to completely and accurately represent the algorithm’s logic and flow.  
Omit irrelevant initialization or unnecessary detail. Do not add separator lines or extra formatting.  
Produce self-contained pseudocode suitable for direct comprehension and easy translation into code.  
Complete output rapidly within 5 seconds.
