Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand, using clear natural language combined with common symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return). Keep the pseudocode compact and mostly one-liners with minimal nesting. Use descriptive but succinct variable and structure names, favor abbreviations when unambiguous, and incorporate symbolic expressions to simplify statements. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, following exactly this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode necessary to fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow. Omit any irrelevant initialization or details not essential for correct implementation. Do not add separator lines or extra formatting. Produce self-contained pseudocode suitable for direct interpretation or translation into code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
