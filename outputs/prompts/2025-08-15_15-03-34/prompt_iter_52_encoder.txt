Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Use predominantly natural language with standard symbolic operators and common control constructs (if, else, for, while, function, return), favoring minimal nesting and mostly one-liners. Use descriptive but brief variable and data structure names, avoid verbose phrases or filler. Number each line sequentially from 1, exactly like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or clarifications—output only the pseudocode necessary to fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow for direct re-implementation. Omit extraneous initialization or unrelated details. Do not use separator lines, extra formatting, or markup. Produce pseudocode that is self-contained, compact, and natural to comprehend. Complete output within 5 seconds.
