Generate clear, compact, and high-level pseudocode that fully captures the algorithm described. Use mostly one-line statements combining natural language with standard symbolic operators and control keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return), minimizing nesting. Favor meaningful, concise variable names and straightforward data structure references without verbosity. Number each line sequentially starting at 1 exactly as shown:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, or summaries. Provide only the essential pseudocode steps needed for precise implementation. Omit unnecessary initializations or details not critical to understanding the algorithm. Do not include separators or extra formatting. The output must be self-contained, easy to read and translate into code, completed within 5 seconds.
