Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is compact, mostly one-liners, and easy to understand. Use natural language with symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return), employing concise expressions and descriptive yet short variable names. Minimize nesting and avoid verbose explanations or unnecessary initialization—only include steps essential for implementing the algorithm’s logic. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, precisely as:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, summaries, notes, or separator lines. Omit any output formatting beyond the numbered pseudocode lines. The output should be self-contained, ready for direct coding, and finished within 5 seconds.
