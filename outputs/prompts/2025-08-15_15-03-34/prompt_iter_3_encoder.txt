Generate clear, concise pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Write in compact, high-level style using natural language combined with symbolic operators and common abbreviations. Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode steps. Prefer succinct one-liners and minimal nesting, use standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function) and assignment arrows (←). Number each line sequentially starting at 1, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Use natural, descriptive variable names and simple data structure references; avoid verbose phrases or filler. Represent iterations, conditions, and calculations directly and efficiently to clearly convey the algorithm’s logic and flow. Omit any redundant detail or initialization that is not absolutely required. Do not add separator lines or extraneous formatting. The output should be self-contained pseudocode suitable for understanding and re-implementation, completed within 5 seconds.
