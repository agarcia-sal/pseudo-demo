Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code within a single Python code block (```python ... ```). Your code must strictly adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use only Python standard library modules (no external packages).
- Read inputs using plain `input()` or `sys.stdin` without any prompt strings.
- Do not output anything other than the requested resultsâ€”no debug prints, no explanations, no extra text outside the code block.
- Maximize clarity while prioritizing computational efficiency and memory usage, ensuring the code executes within 5 seconds for typical problem sizes.
- Handle edge cases thoughtfully, avoid redundant calculations, and leverage Python language features and appropriate data structures for concise, robust solutions.
- Importing standard modules is allowed if it improves clarity or performance.
- The final output should be solely the converted, runnable Python code enclosed by triple backticks and `python` language tag.
