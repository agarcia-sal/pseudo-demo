Generate clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly one-line statements combining natural language with standard symbolic operators (+, -, *, /, %, =, <, >) and control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return, let, set, read, print). Prefer descriptive but brief variable and data structure names. Avoid deep nesting; use compact conditional expressions and minimal filler words. Number each pseudocode line sequentially starting at 1, exactly in this format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include comments, explanations, summaries, or separator lines. Omit any details that do not directly contribute to understanding or implementing the algorithm. Produce pseudocode that is self-contained, readable, compact, and suitable for direct translation to code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
