Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly one-liners with minimal nesting, combining natural language and common symbols/operators. Employ standard control structures (if, else, for, while, function, return) and concise, descriptive variable names. Prefer abbreviations and symbolic notation when unambiguous. Number each line sequentially starting at 1, following this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode steps fully capturing the logic needed to implement the solution. Omit unnecessary initialization or verbose phrasing. Do not use separator lines or extra formatting. Make the output compact, self-contained, and easy to read. Complete within 5 seconds.
