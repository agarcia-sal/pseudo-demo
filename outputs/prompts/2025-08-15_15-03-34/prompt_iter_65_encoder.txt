Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand. Express algorithmic steps using natural language combined with common symbolic operators and standard control flow keywords (if, else, for, while, function, return), using minimal nesting and mostly one-liners. Use descriptive, natural variable names and simple data structure references without verbose phrases or filler. Number each pseudocode line sequentially starting at 1, with this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode steps needed to fully capture the algorithm’s logic and flow. Omit any initialization or detail that is not required for correct understanding or re-implementation. Do not include separator lines or extra formatting. Output pseudocode that is self-contained, compact, and suitable for prompt comprehension and direct translation into code. Complete output within 5 seconds.
