Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use clear natural language with compact, high-level expressions. Prefer one-liners, symbolic assignments, and abbreviations. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, notes, comments, or explanations. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce only the pseudocode as your output. Your function has a 5-second timeout; optimize for clarity and brevity within this limit.
