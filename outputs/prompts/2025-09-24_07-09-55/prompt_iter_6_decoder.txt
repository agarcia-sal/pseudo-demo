Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, idiomatic Python code. Preserve all original function and class names, maintaining the class and object structure exactly as outlined in the pseudocode. Write clean, well-indented code with meaningful variable names and concise logic, prioritizing readability and efficiency. You may use any standard Python libraries if needed to improve performance or clarity. The function(s) must complete execution within 5 seconds.

Enclose your entire response strictly within a Python code block formatted as follows:

```python
