Generate the pseudocode representation of the given code, preserving all original function names, class names, objects, and their hierarchical structures exactly as in the source. The pseudocode must be as abstract and high-level as possible while maintaining precise logical equivalence. Use clear natural-language statements combined with concise symbolic expressions, avoiding unnecessary detail or implementation-specific syntax. The style should favor explicit keywords (e.g., FUNCTION, FOR, IF, RETURN), meaningful variables, and structured indentation that mirrors code nesting. Output only the pseudocode without any explanations, summaries, comments, notes, or separator lines. Do not include purpose, overview, or clarifying remarksâ€”only the translated pseudocode itself, formatted for maximum readability and conceptual clarity.
