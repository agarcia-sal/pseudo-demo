Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description.  
The pseudocode should be high-level, natural language-rich yet compact, using symbolic representations and abbreviations where helpful.  
Retain all original class names, function names, parameters, and object structures exactly as in the source.  
Prefer one-liner statements whenever possible without sacrificing clarity.  
Do not include purpose statements, summaries, explanations, notes, or any text other than pseudocode.  
Strictly follow this numbered line format for output:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separators, extra spacing, or unrelated text.  
Output only the pseudocode, aiming for clear, minimal, and structurally faithful code within 5 seconds.
