Translate the following pseudocode into optimized, clean, and well-structured Python code. Your code must:

- Preserve all original class names, function names, and their signatures exactly as stated in the pseudocode.
- Maintain class and method organization as shown (e.g., methods inside the given classes).
- Properly define and use all variables and data structures referenced in the pseudocode.
- Handle input and output types appropriately, including constructing necessary helper functions or classes if implied by the pseudocode (e.g., tree or linked list node constructors).
- Avoid using undefined names or Python keywords that don’t exist (e.g., replace any pseudocode ‘null’ with Python’s `None`).
- Import any necessary standard or third-party Python libraries to maximize code efficiency and clarity.
- Ensure the resulting code executes correctly within a 5-second time limit.
- Return only valid Python code enclosed strictly within a single Python code block using triple backticks with “python” annotation, like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or additional text—only the Python code block with your final answer.
