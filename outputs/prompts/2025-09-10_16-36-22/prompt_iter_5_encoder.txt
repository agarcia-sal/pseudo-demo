Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description that is easy to read and understand.  
Ensure the pseudocode preserves all original class names, function names, parameters, object structures, and their nesting exactly as in the source code.  
Use natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations for brevity. Prefer one-liner statements when clarity permits.  
Avoid any explanations, comments, notes, summaries, or purpose statements—output exclusively pseudocode lines.  
Strictly number each line starting from 1, following this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Keep the pseudocode compact yet structurally faithful and complete enough to implement the logic.  
Do not include separators or any text beyond the numbered pseudocode lines.  
Aim for clarity, minimalism, and fidelity to the source, delivering output within 5 seconds.
