Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, efficient, and fully functional Python module that runs correctly within 5 seconds. Follow these enhanced, precise instructions exactly:

- Preserve **all** class names, function names, method signatures, and class/object hierarchies exactly as given in the pseudocode. No renaming, restructuring, or omission.
- Retain **all** type annotations and typing hints exactly as provided.
- Initialize every variable and data structure explicitly and properly.
- Convert **all** pseudocode literals and language-specific symbols into valid Python equivalents. This includes but is not limited to:
  - `null`, `NULL`, `nil`, etc. → `None`
  - Boolean literals → `True` / `False`
  - Any other language-dependent constructs → proper Python syntax/values
- Automatically detect domain-specific custom data structures from the pseudocode signatures, including but not limited to:
  - Binary trees (e.g., classes named `TreeNode`)
  - Singly linked lists (e.g., `ListNode`)
  - Doubly linked lists, intervals, graphs, or any other domain patterns explicitly mentioned
- For every detected complex data structure used as function arguments, generate robust, **fully tested**, and reusable builder/helper functions that:
  - Take typical serialized input representations (lists or nested lists with `None` as null indicators) and convert them to fully linked Python objects matching the data structure.
  - Sanitize inputs by replacing **all** pseudocode literals (`null`, `nil`, string `'null'`, `'None'`, etc.) with Python `None` before constructing objects.
  - Correctly handle incomplete or unbalanced serialized input formats as per standard conventions (e.g., level-order for binary trees, sequential linking for linked lists).
- Implement a transparent **input preprocessing layer** such that:
  - Functions/methods receive **only** fully instantiated Python objects for complex structured inputs, never raw lists or primitives.
  - This conversion must happen automatically *inside* the generated code before the core logic runs.
- Detect and import **only** the minimal necessary Python standard or broadly accepted libraries based on actual usage (e.g., `collections`, `heapq`, `math`, `typing`, etc.).
- The output should be one single, complete, self-contained Python module that:
  - Can be executed as-is without any further modifications or external dependencies beyond the standard Python environment.
  - Does not contain debugging prints, explanatory comments, or any text outside the code block.
- Do **not** add any explanatory text, comments, or debugging output—output must be only the code inside a single triple-backtick code block tagged `python`.
- The solution must robustly handle all edge cases and avoid runtime errors related to improperly preprocessed inputs (e.g., `AttributeError` due to list-objects passed instead of node instances).
- Keep your implementation optimal and concise to respect the 5-second runtime constraint.
