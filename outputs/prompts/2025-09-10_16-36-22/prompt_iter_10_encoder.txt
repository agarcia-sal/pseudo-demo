Generate concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode from the given problem description.  
- Preserve all original class names, method/function names, parameters, and their hierarchical structure exactly as in the source.  
- Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation and abbreviations to achieve compactness and readability.  
- Prefer single-line statements when clarity is maintained.  
- Number each pseudocode line starting at 1, formatted as:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

- Do not include any explanation, commentary, summary, notes, or purpose—output only the pseudocode lines in order.  
- Keep the pseudocode structurally faithful and sufficiently detailed to implement the solution, yet minimal and easy to understand.  
- Avoid redundant details or overly verbose constructs; focus on clarity and brevity.  
- Do not add separators or any other text besides the numbered pseudocode lines.  
- Complete output within 5 seconds.
