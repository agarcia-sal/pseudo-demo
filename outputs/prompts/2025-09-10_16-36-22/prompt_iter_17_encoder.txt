Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description preserving original class names, function names, parameters, and object structures exactly as in the source code.  
Produce pseudocode that is easy to read and understand, using natural language combined with symbolic notation and abbreviations for compactness. Prefer one-liner statements and avoid unnecessary verbosity.  
Do not include any explanations, comments, notes, summaries, or extraneous text—output only numbered pseudocode lines beginning at 1, strictly following this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Maintain full structural fidelity (indentation, nesting, classes, and methods) and ensure the pseudocode is sufficient for logic implementation.  
Do not add separators or any text before or after the pseudocode.  
If input uses language-specific null or None, represent such literals exactly as in source or convert to a clear pseudocode null if ambiguous.  
Respond swiftly within 5 seconds, balancing clarity, minimalism, and completeness.
