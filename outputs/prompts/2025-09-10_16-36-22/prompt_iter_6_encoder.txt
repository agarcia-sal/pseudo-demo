Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the provided problem description that is clear, easy to read, and structurally faithful to the original code.  
Preserve all original class names, function names, parameters, object hierarchies, and nesting exactly as specified.  
Use mostly natural language enriched with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep the pseudocode compact and expressive.  
Favor one-liner statements and direct assignments when clarity permits, but maintain completeness and logical flow suitable for implementation.  
Do not include any explanations, comments, summaries, or metadata—output only the pseudocode lines.  
Strictly number each line beginning at 1 in this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid separators or any non-pseudocode text.  
Ensure output matches parameter names and structures as given in the original problem for seamless downstream use.  
Aim for minimal line count while retaining readability and fidelity.  
Produce output within 5 seconds.
