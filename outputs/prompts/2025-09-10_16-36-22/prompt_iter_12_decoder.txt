Translate the provided pseudocode into a fully functional, efficient, and clean Python solution that executes within 5 seconds. Adhere strictly to the following guidelines:

- Keep all class names, function names, method signatures, and their exact class/object hierarchy unchanged from the pseudocode.
- Explicitly initialize every variable and data structure used.
- Convert all pseudocode literals to their correct Python equivalents (e.g., `null` → `None`, boolean literals, etc.).
- Automatically detect any complex data structures (e.g., binary trees, linked lists, graphs) from function/class signatures or parameters, and generate robust, standardized helper functions to:
  - Convert typical serialized inputs (such as lists containing `None` values) into their appropriate Python object forms (e.g., `TreeNode` for binary trees, `ListNode` for linked lists).
  - Handle and replace all occurrences of pseudocode literals like `null` or equivalent with Python’s `None` transparently before object construction.
  - Validate and properly link nodes to replicate expected standard problem input conventions (e.g., level-order for trees, sequential linking for lists).
- Pre-process all input arguments so that before the solution’s methods are called, any complex-type inputs are transformed from raw serialized formats (like lists) into their corresponding Python class objects. Do **not** pass raw lists where an object node is expected.
- Infer and insert only the necessary Python standard or commonly-used third-party library imports based on usage within the translated code to ensure correctness and optimal performance.
- The final output must be self-contained and directly runnable as-is without requiring any manual fixes or external context.
- Remove all explanations, debug prints, comments, or any text outside the single Python code block.
- Enclose the entire solution in one single code block annotated with ```python```.
- Preserve all typing annotations if present in the pseudocode.

Provide only the completed Python code enclosed as follows:

```python

Do NOT add any text outside the code block.
