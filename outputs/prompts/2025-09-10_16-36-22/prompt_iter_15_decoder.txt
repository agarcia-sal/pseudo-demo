Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, fully functional, and efficient Python solution that runs within 5 seconds. Follow **all** these instructions precisely:

- Preserve **exactly** all class names, function names, method signatures, and class/object hierarchies as in the pseudocode without any renaming or restructuring.
- Retain all type annotations (typing hints) present in the pseudocode.
- Initialize all variables and data structures explicitly and correctly.
- Replace **all** pseudocode literal values with proper Python equivalents (e.g., `null` or `NULL` or similar â†’ `None`, boolean literals correctly as `True`/`False`, handle any other language-specific literals).
- Analyze all function and class signatures to detect and identify any common data structures such as:
  - Binary trees (e.g., `TreeNode`)
  - Linked lists (e.g., `ListNode`)
  - Graphs, intervals, or other domain-specific structures if mentioned
- Automatically generate robust, reusable, and standardized helper functions that:
  - Convert serialized input formats (like lists containing `None`s and values) into proper Python object forms (e.g., build binary tree nodes level-order, build linked lists sequentially).
  - Transparently preprocess all raw inputs to replace **all** pseudocode literals (`null`, `nil`, etc.) with Python `None` before object instantiation.
  - Ensure all nodes are linked and validated correctly according to the common input conventions of standard problems (e.g., level-order completeness for trees, sequential linking for singly linked lists).
- Implement an **input-preprocessing layer** inside the code that automatically transforms any input arguments representing complex data structures from raw serialized formats (like lists) into their respective Python object representations *before* calling the solution methods. This means the methods of your solution class should receive fully constructed objects, never raw lists or primitive serializations for these parameters.
- Detect which Python standard libraries or widely accepted third-party libraries are necessary based on your generated code (e.g., `collections`, `typing`, `heapq`, `math`, etc.) and import **only those** to ensure correctness and optimal runtime.
- The final output should be a **single, complete, self-contained Python module** that runs successfully as-is without any further edits or dependencies beyond the standard Python environment.
- **Do not** include any explanations, debugging code, comments, prints, or text outside the code block.
- Output **only** the final Python code inside a single code block with triple backticks and the language tag `python`.

Make sure your solution handles edge cases, adheres closely to the pseudocode logic, and avoids any runtime errors like `AttributeError` or `NameError` due to improper input preprocessing.
