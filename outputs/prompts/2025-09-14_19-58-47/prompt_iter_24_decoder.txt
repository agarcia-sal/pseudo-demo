Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, idiomatic, and efficient Python implementation with these requirements:

- Preserve all class names, method names, method signatures, and class/object structure exactly as presented in the pseudocode without any changes.
- Correctly interpret and implement the data structures implied by the pseudocode (e.g., if inputs imply linked lists, convert input lists to appropriate linked list classes).
- Use explicit and precise Python typing annotations consistent with pseudocode types where possible.
- Prioritize correctness, clarity, and optimal runtime efficiency within a 5-second execution constraint.
- Leverage appropriate standard library modules or reputable third-party libraries if they enhance performance or clarity, but keep the solution self-contained and runnable as-is.
- Avoid adding any extra comments, debugging prints, or explanatory text; output exactly one syntactically valid Python code block.
- Your final output must be enclosed solely within a Python code block as shown:
```python

```

Follow these instructions carefully to deliver robust, production-quality code strictly aligned with the pseudocode provided, ready for immediate execution and testing.
