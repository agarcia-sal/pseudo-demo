Translate the given pseudocode into optimized, idiomatic Python code that maintains all original class names, method names, method signatures, and overall class and object structure exactly as described in the pseudocode. Your implementation must:

- Automatically infer and correctly construct any implied data structures from the pseudocode (e.g., convert list inputs to linked-list nodes if the problem context requires it).
- Maintain exact input and output formats inferred or explicitly stated in the pseudocode.
- Include full, self-contained code that requires no modifications or additions to run correctly.
- Use precise Python type annotations based on pseudocode signatures.
- Prioritize correctness, efficiency, and clarity, ensuring runtime completes within 5 seconds for typical input sizes.
- Utilize any appropriate Python standard libraries or third-party packages available to improve code readability and performance.
- Avoid all unnecessary comments, debugging prints, or explanation text; output only the final valid code in one Python code block.
- Preserve the logic and control flow exactly to produce outputs identical to the pseudocode intent.

Output ONLY the code inside a single Python code block as follows:

```python
# your fully translated, ready-to-run Python code here
```
