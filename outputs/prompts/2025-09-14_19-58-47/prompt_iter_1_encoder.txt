Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use a compact, high-level style with natural language, symbolic representations, abbreviations, and one-liners where possible. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, notes, or comments—only output the pseudocode. Format steps as numbered lines with clear assignments and control structures as in this example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode is straightforward and understandable. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this time.
