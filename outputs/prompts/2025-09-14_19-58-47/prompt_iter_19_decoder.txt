Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that strictly preserves all class names, method names, signatures, and class/object structures exactly as provided. Your translation must:

- Automatically convert implied data structures in the pseudocode into correct Python equivalents (e.g., lists, linked lists, trees), including implementing necessary helper classes (like ListNode) if not given.
- Accept inputs and produce outputs exactly as indicated by the pseudocode, matching behavior precisely with respect to data types and return values.
- Use Python typing hints consistent with those or implied by the pseudocode.
- Prioritize correctness, clarity, and optimal runtime efficiency; code must complete within 5 seconds for typical inputs.
- Employ any standard or third-party Python libraries if they improve performance or clarity, but avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Be self-contained and syntactically correct, ready to run without further modification.
- Contain no additional commentary, explanations, or text other than the complete code.
- Output your entire solution enclosed _only_ inside a single Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# your complete translated code here
```

Ensure that all details from the pseudocode (including variable initialization, control flow, and operations) are faithfully and precisely implemented for reliable and testable correctness.
