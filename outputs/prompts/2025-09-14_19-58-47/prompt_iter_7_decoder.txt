Translate the provided pseudocode into fully functional, idiomatic Python code that preserves the exact class names, method names, signatures, and overall class/object structure from the pseudocode without any modifications. Your implementation must:

- Correctly and efficiently handle typical input data types and structures implied by the pseudocode (e.g., convert input lists to linked lists if the pseudocode suggests such structures).
- Expect inputs as described by the pseudocode’s context and ensure the output matches exactly what the pseudocode dictates.
- Prioritize runtime efficiency and correctness within a strict 5-second execution limit.
- Use appropriate Python typing hints matching the pseudocode’s annotations when applicable.
- Use any relevant standard or third-party Python library to improve performance and clarity.
- Avoid extraneous comments, explanations, or output outside the single requested code block.
- Produce code that is syntactically valid, self-contained, and ready to run without requiring any further edits or adaptation.

Output only the complete Python code enclosed exclusively in a single Python code block formatted as:
