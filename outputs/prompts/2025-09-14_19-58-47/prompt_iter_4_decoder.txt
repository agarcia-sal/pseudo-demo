Translate the given pseudocode into fully working, idiomatic Python code that strictly preserves the original class names, function names, method signatures, and overall class/object structure as described. Your translation must be efficient and correctly handle all typical input data formats relevant to the pseudocode (e.g., convert lists to linked lists if needed, use proper types, etc.) so the code runs correctly within a 5-second execution limit. Use any standard Python libraries if helpful. Output only the complete Python code inside a single code block formatted as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Do not include any extra explanations, comments, or text outside the code block. Ensure the output code is ready to be directly tested and executed with no further modifications.
