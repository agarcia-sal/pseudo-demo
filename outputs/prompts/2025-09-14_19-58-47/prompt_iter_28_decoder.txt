Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, executable, and idiomatic Python implementation preserving all class names, method names, method signatures, and class/object architecture exactly as presented. Your translation must:

- Accurately represent all data structures implied or explicitly defined in the pseudocode, including converting basic types (e.g., lists) to complex structures (e.g., linked lists) if indicated.
- Use Python type hints consistent with types and annotations in the pseudocode.
- Keep all algorithmic details logically and semantically intact, ensuring exact input-output behavior and result correctness.
- Optimize for runtime efficiency and clarity within a 5-second execution budget; leverage Python standard libraries, typing, and well-known third-party libraries only if they improve reliability or performance and maintain portability.
- Avoid adding any debugging outputs, comments, or explanation text; output solely the required Python code.
- Strictly enclose the entire solution within a single Python code block as follows exactly:

```python
# your complete translated Python code here
```

No extra text or content outside this code block is permitted.
