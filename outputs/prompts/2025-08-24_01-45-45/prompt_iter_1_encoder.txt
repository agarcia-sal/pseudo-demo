Generate concise, high-level pseudocode directly implementing the given problem. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview, or explanatory notes—only pseudocode. Use readable, natural language with symbolic and abbreviated forms where suitable. Favor one-liners and compact constructs without comments. Format each step as a numbered line like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second output limit.
