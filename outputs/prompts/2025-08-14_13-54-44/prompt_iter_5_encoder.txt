Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be high-level and compact, using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Prefer one-liners where possible. Do not include purpose, summary, or overview statements. Do not add notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode steps. Follow the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should be structured, clear, and ensure readability within a 5-second timeout for generating the response.
