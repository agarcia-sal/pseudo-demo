Given the pseudocode below, determine with high precision whether it is fully reproducible — meaning the pseudocode provides *complete, unambiguous, and logically sound* instructions encapsulated in properly defined classes and functions, sufficient to reliably pass **all relevant unit tests** for any valid inputs.  

Your output must be exactly **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible, or exactly **0** if it is not.  
Do not output any explanations, extra text, formatting, or whitespace—only the single digit **1** or **0**.  
The order of outputs must correspond exactly to the order of pseudocode inputs provided.

To decide, verify that:  
- The main solution class and all required functions are correctly defined and named.  
- All variables, loops, conditional branches, and data structures are clearly and fully specified with no ambiguity or missing logic details.  
- The pseudocode covers edge cases and error conditions as expected for the problem domain.  
- Return statements and function outputs are clearly and appropriately given.  
- No syntax errors, missing declarations, or undefined references exist in the pseudocode.  
- The code structure enables direct mapping to a working implementation without further guesswork.  

Do not speculate or guess; if any necessary detail or correctness aspect is missing or unclear, output **0**.
