Translate the given code into clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand. Use mostly natural language with widely recognized shorthand, symbolic notation, and abbreviations to keep lines succinct. Prioritize single-line statements for simple actions and control structures; indent only nested or complex logic by one tab per level. Avoid unnecessary low-level detail, verbosity, or redundancy while ensuring completeness.

Strict formatting and style rules:  
- Output numbered lines starting at 1, incrementing by 1 without gaps  
- Output **only** the pseudocode lines; no explanations, comments, summary, headers, footers, blank lines, or separators  
- Use **tab characters** (no spaces) for indentation; one tab per nested block  
- Use compact forms of control structures: e.g.,  
  `if condition then action` (single line if simple)  
  `while condition: action`  
  `for i = 0 to n-1`  
  `for all elements in A`  
- Use clear natural-language commands with standard shorthand: e.g.,  
  “let n be integer”  
  “read n”  
  “set x to y” or “x ← y” for assignment  
  “swap A[i], A[j]”  
  “print all elements of A”  
  “return result”  
- Favor the assignment arrow `←` for clarity and brevity  
- Write loops and conditionals compactly on a single line when possible; use indentation and multiple lines only for nested or multiline bodies  
- Avoid redundant phrases and excess wording; be as brief as possible without losing clarity or completeness  
- Use intuitive, conventional terminology and phrase structure across diverse programming concepts  
- Do not insert blank lines or separators

Example of target pseudocode style to follow closely:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for i = 0 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to i  
  for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
8. print all elements of A

Produce the best pseudocode possible within 5 seconds, adhering exactly to these rules and style; output only the numbered pseudocode lines with prescribed indentation.
