Translate the given code into concise, easy-to-read, high-level pseudocode using natural language mixed with symbolic and abbreviated forms. The pseudocode should be compact—prefer one-liners and omit less critical details to reduce length. Avoid comments, explanations, or any purpose/summary/overview statements. Follow this numbered format:

1. statement  
2. while condition: action  
3. for var in range: action  

Ensure clarity without verbose detail, strictly outputting only the pseudocode. Your output should resemble:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
8.   set min_i to i  
9.   for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
10.    set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
11.   swap A[i], A[min_i]  
12. print all elements of A  

Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best result within this limit.
