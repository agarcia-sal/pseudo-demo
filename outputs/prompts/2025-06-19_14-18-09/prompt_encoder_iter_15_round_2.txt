Translate the given code into clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode that prioritizes readability and completeness using brief natural language combined with standard shorthand and symbolic notation. Output the pseudocode as mostly compact single-line statements; use indentation with tab characters only for nested blocks and break into multiple lines strictly when necessary to clarify complex logic. Maintain a consistent, minimal abstraction level—avoid low-level implementation details but include all essential steps and control flow.

Strict formatting and style rules:  
- Output **only** numbered pseudocode lines starting at 1, incrementing by 1 without gaps  
- No explanations, comments, summaries, headings, footers, blank lines, or separators  
- Use **tab characters** (exactly one per nested level) for indentation  
- Write concise one-liners for simple statements and control structures—e.g., “if X then Y”, “while condition: action”, “for var = start to end”, “for all elements in A”  
- Use natural language with standard shorthand: “let n be integer”, “read n”, “set min_i to i”, “swap A[i], A[min_i]”, “increment x”  
- Use the assignment arrow “←” for assignments only; prefer natural language for increment/decrement and conditionals  
- Express loops and conditionals in compact, familiar forms, e.g., “for i = 0 to n-1”, “while x < n: x++”, “if X then Y else Z”  
- Avoid redundancy, verbosity, or overly elaborate expressions—be as brief as clarity permits  
- Don’t insert any blank lines or extra formatting other than specified numbering and indentation  

Example style to imitate exactly:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for each i = 0 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to i  
  for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
8. print all elements of A
