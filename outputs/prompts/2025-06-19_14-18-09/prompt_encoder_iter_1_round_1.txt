Translate the given code into clear, concise pseudocode that balances natural language and symbolic notation to be compact yet highly readable. Represent control flow and data operations faithfully using mostly one-liners that capture essential logic without excessive detail or verbosity. Use standard conventions:

- Use plain English words for types, actions, and declarations (e.g., “let n be integer”, “read n”, “print result”)
- Use assignment arrows (←) for variable updates and assignments
- Write conditionals inline and succinctly (e.g., “set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]”)
- Use standard loop notations: “for i = 0 to n-1”, “for all elements in A”, “while x < n”
- Indent nested statements with one tab per level, no extra spaces
- Omit comments, explanations, titles, summaries, or any other notes—output only the pseudocode steps
- Number lines sequentially from 1
- Avoid overly long lines while preserving clarity and completeness
- Do not add separator lines or decorative formatting

Example style to imitate:

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
  set min_i to i  
  for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
8. print all elements of A
