Translate the given code into clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode that balances natural language with common abbreviations and symbolic notation for readability and completeness. Prioritize one-line statements, using indentation only for nested or complex blocks. Use straightforward and compact expressions without verbose wording or unnecessary detail.

Output format and style rules:  
- Output **only** numbered pseudocode lines starting at 1, incrementing by 1 without gaps  
- No explanations, comments, summaries, or blank lines anywhere  
- Use **tab characters** (not spaces) for indentation, one tab per nested level  
- Prefer single-line constructs where possible, e.g., `if condition then action`, `while condition: action`  
- Use standard pseudocode conventions: `let x be integer`, `read x`, `set x ← y`, `swap A[i], A[j]`  
- Use the assignment arrow `←` for all variable assignments  
- Write loops compactly, e.g., `for i = 0 to n-1`, `for all elements in A`  
- Use minimal words to maintain clarity and completeness, avoiding redundancy  
- Avoid any separators, header/footer lines, or extra formatting beyond these rules

Example style your output should follow exactly (but adapt for the given code): 

1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
  set min_i to i  
  for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
8. print all elements of A
