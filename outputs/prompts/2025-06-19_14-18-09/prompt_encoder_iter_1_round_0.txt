Translate the given code into clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode that balances natural language and symbolic notation for readability and compactness. Express control flow and data operations accurately with minimal detail, avoiding verbosity or unnecessary explanation. Use mostly one-line statements unless indentation is required for nested blocks. Number each pseudocode line sequentially. Do not include comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode.

Formatting guidelines:  
- Use simple, natural language for types, declarations, and actions (e.g., “let n be integer”, “read n”, “print result”)  
- Use arrows (←) for assignments and updates  
- Write conditions and assignments concisely and inline where possible (e.g., “set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]”)  
- Use standard loop formats: “for i = 0 to n-1”, “while x < n”, or “for all elements in A”  
- Indent nested blocks exactly one tab per level, no extra spaces  
- Keep lines short but clear—avoid cramming multiple statements on one line unless simple  
- Omit separators, headers, or footers; only output numbered pseudocode lines starting at 1  

Example style:  
1. in function main  
2. let n be integer  
3. read n  
4. let A be vector of integers  
5. set size of A = n  
6. read n elements into A  
7. for all elements in A  
  set min_i to i  
  for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
   set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
  swap A[i], A[min_i]  
8. print all elements of A
