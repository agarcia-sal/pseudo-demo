Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should use more natural language, be compact and high-level, and prefer one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format style:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Ensure the pseudocode is clear and understandable. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
