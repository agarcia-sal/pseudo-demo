Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description, preserving the original function name exactly.  
The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, using natural language with compact, symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate.  
Prefer one-liner statements when clear and maintain a consistent minimal format like:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Avoid purpose, summary, overview, or explanatory comments—output only the pseudocode itself.  
Use control flow keywords and expressions naturally, keep data structures and operations clear but succinct.  
Do not include separator lines or extra formatting.  
Ensure the final pseudocode is complete and self-contained, suitable for direct interpretation or implementation.  
Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best pseudocode possible within this limit.
