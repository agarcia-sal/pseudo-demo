Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language mixed with symbolic notation, favor one-liners and abbreviations, and keep it compact and high-level. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Your pseudocode should be understandable, use clear variable names, and fit within a 5-second generation timeout.
