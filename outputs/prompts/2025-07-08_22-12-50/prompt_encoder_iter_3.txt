Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic notation, abbreviations, and one-liners where possible to keep it compact and high-level. Do not include purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—only pseudocode steps. Follow this format exactly:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Ensure clarity and understandability within the pseudocode structure. Your function has a 5-second timeout; aim to produce the best possible outcome within this constraint.
