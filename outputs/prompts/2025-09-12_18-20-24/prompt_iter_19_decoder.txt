```python
Translate the provided pseudocode into a single, complete, and immediately runnable Python code snippet, strictly preserving all class names, function names, method names, argument signatures, return types, decorators, and nested structures exactly as provided in the pseudocode.

Your implementation must:

- Import at the top all potentially needed standard libraries (e.g., typing, collections, heapq, math, itertools, functools, heapq, queue, re) to enable idiomatic and efficient solutions, regardless of whether they're explicitly mentioned.

- Automatically detect any complex serialized data structures in the inputs (e.g., binary trees, singly or doubly linked lists, graphs serialized as adjacency lists, arrays with null-like values) and:
  - Define all necessary helper classes (e.g., TreeNode, ListNode, Node) with complete type annotations and accurate constructor methods.
  - Implement robust, reusable deserialization functions for each data structure type that:
    - Normalize all null representations (case-insensitive string forms like "null", "none", "nil", as well as python None and other null-placeholder variants) before processing.
    - Handle empty inputs, trailing or intermediate nulls, malformed inputs gracefully without runtime errors.
    - Establish fully linked Python object graphs, ensuring no raw lists or primitives are passed where objects are expected.
  - When multiple serialized inputs appear (e.g., root1, root2), provide individual deserializers per input, and perform input conversions inside the respective class methods or solution functions, never exposing raw serialized inputs internally.

- Ensure all deserialization and input transformations occur strictly within the relevant class method(s) or constructor(s), shielding internal logic from raw input formats.

- Maintain exact method signatures including explicit use of `self` for instance methods and all provided type hints; do not alter return types or parameter names.

- Avoid any extraneous output â€” no comments beyond concise, essential inline clarifications, no debugging or print statements, no explanations outside the code block.

- Produce idiomatic, readable, and efficient Python code that runs correctly on first execution with zero attribute or type errors, even for complex class hierarchies or multiple nested serialized inputs.

- Enclose the entire solution in one continuous code block with triple backticks specifying Python:
```python
# Final translated solution goes here
```

The goal: deliver flawless production-grade Python code that flawlessly bridges pseudocode and runnable implementation, resolving all previous issues related to null-handling, input deserialization, and type mismatches, thereby maximizing pass rates and runtime robustness.
