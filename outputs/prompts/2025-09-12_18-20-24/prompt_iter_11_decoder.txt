```python
Translate the provided pseudocode into one fully self-contained, executable Python code block, strictly preserving all class names, function/method names, signatures (including argument names and order), class hierarchies, and data structures exactly as given.

When the pseudocode involves complex data structures represented via serialized formats (e.g., binary trees as lists like [1,2,null,3], or singly linked lists as [1,2,3]):

- Define all relevant helper classes (e.g., TreeNode, ListNode) with clear and precise type annotations.
- Implement fully robust, thoroughly edge-case-aware helper functions to deserialize these serialized inputs into properly linked Python objects.
- Handle all variants of null-like values (e.g., null, NULL, Null, None, 'nil', empty strings) case-insensitively, converting them safely to Python None.
- Ensure these deserialization helpers correctly process empty inputs, inputs with intermediate nulls, and nested structures without causing attribute or type errors.
- Deserializers must be free of side effects and efficient to avoid runtime bottlenecks.

For the core solution logic:

- Always convert serialized inputs to their corresponding object instances within the class constructor or the main solution method *before* any algorithmic processing, so all further codebases deal exclusively with properly typed objects rather than raw lists or primitives.
- Maintain the original method signatures exactly, including the explicit use of 'self' in instance methods.
- Preserve any decorators or type hints present in the pseudocode.
- Import all necessary standard or widely accepted Python modules (e.g., typing, collections, heapq, math, itertools) essential for clean, idiomatic, and performant code.
- Avoid any extraneous print statements, explanatory comments beyond concise inline clarifications, or any output outside the single code block.

Output your entire solution strictly enclosed in one contiguous Python code block using triple backticks with "python" specified, like this:

```python
# Your complete translated code here
```

Do not include any preamble, postamble, or explanation outside or inside the code block.

Your goal is to generate reliable, test-ready Python code from any pseudocode input—especially those involving nested classes and serialized complex data inputs—with zero attribute or runtime errors related to input conversion or missing definitions, while keeping the original structure fully intact and improving overall test-time correctness across diverse challenges.
