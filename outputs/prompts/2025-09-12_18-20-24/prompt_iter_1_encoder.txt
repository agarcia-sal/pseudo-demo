Generate concise and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should use natural language combined with symbolic notation, be compact and high-level, and avoid detailed explanations, comments, or purpose/summary statements. Prefer one-liners, abbreviations, and symbolic assignments. Structure the pseudocode in a clear step-by-step format like:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Return only the pseudocode following this format, without notes or overview. Aim for clarity and brevity to produce the best possible pseudocode within a 5-second timeout.
