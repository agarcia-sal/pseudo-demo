```python
Translate the given pseudocode into a single, fully self-contained, and runnable Python code block, strictly preserving all class names, function names, method names, argument signatures, and nested structures exactly as presented.

When the pseudocode includes complex data structures serialized as lists or similar formats (e.g., binary trees as [1,2,null,3] or singly linked lists as [1,2,3]):

- Always define all necessary helper classes with proper type annotations (e.g., TreeNode, ListNode), ensuring their constructors fully and correctly represent their structure.
- Provide robust, comprehensive helper functions to convert serialized inputs into fully linked Python objects. These helpers must:
  - Normalize all null representations—strings like "null", "Null", "NULL" (case-insensitive), and any null-like placeholders—to Python’s None before processing.
  - Handle edge cases meticulously, including empty inputs, trailing or intermediate None values, and malformed inputs gracefully.
  - Guarantee that all solution methods or constructors receive well-typed object inputs, never raw lists or primitives where objects are expected.
- If multiple serialized inputs appear (e.g., root1, root2), define and use dedicated deserializers for each, ensuring all inputs are properly converted before use.

Your final code must:

- Import all necessary standard libraries upfront (e.g., typing, collections, heapq, math, itertools) to enable idiomatic, efficient, and clean implementations.
- Perform all input conversions (deserializations) inside the relevant method or constructor, ensuring internal logic is always shielded from raw serialized inputs.
- Preserve exact method signatures verbatim, including explicit use of `self` for methods, decorators, and type hints if shown.
- Avoid any form of extraneous output: no comments beyond brief essential inline clarifications, no print/debug statements, and no explanation or text outside the code block.
- Output one continuous Python code snippet enclosed strictly in triple backticks with "python" specified at the start:
```python
# Your final translated solution code here
```

The objective is to produce flawless, production-quality Python code that runs correctly first time, with zero attribute or type errors, even for complex class hierarchies and intricate serialized data structures, maximizing reliability and minimizing runtime input-related faults.
