```python
Translate the provided pseudocode into a single, fully executable Python code block enclosed in triple backticks with `python`. Your translation must:

- Strictly preserve all class names, method names, function names, argument names, their exact argument order, and hierarchical structure as given in the pseudocode.
- Keep all methods belonging to their classes, including correct `self` usage and any decorators if present.
- Accurately translate all types, including optional type hints if shown, else use idiomatic Python typing.
- Import only necessary built-in or standard library modules explicitly required for a clean, efficient, and idiomatic implementation.
- Detect any serialized representations of common data structures (especially binary trees, singly linked lists, or N-ary trees) presented as lists or arrays with possible `null` (literal, or variants like 'Null', 'NULL', None, etc.), and automatically:
  - Define all needed helper classes (e.g., `TreeNode`, `ListNode`) once, with clear type annotations.
  - Implement robust, thoroughly tested converter functions that transform these serialized lists into correct linked node instances, properly handling every occurrence of `null` or equivalent to Python `None`.  
  - Ensure converter functions gracefully handle edge cases such as empty lists, fully null lists, or lists with intermediate null values.
  - Automatically normalize all `null` variants in input lists before conversion.
- In the main solution methods or constructors, convert all input parameters from raw serialized forms into their fully constructed object counterparts before any solution logic runs, ensuring that the core algorithm never operates on raw primitive lists where node objects are expected.
- Avoid printing or logging from the code; exclude unnecessary comments or explanations â€” include only minimal inline comments if absolutely helpful for clarity.
- Output code that is ready for direct import and testing without any additional modification.
- Produce clean, compact, and idiomatic Python code that minimizes runtime errors related to input formats or missing classes.

Your final output must be ONLY the complete Python code block formatted exactly as:

```python
# Your translated and fully self-contained code here
```

With no extra text before, inside, or after the code block.
```
