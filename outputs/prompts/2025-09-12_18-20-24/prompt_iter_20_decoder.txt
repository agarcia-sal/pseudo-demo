You are tasked with translating arbitrary pseudocode into a single, fully self-contained, runnable Python code snippet that precisely mirrors the pseudocode’s structure—including all class names, method/function names, argument names and types, nested scopes, and control flow logic—without altering any semantics or signatures.

Follow these strong guidelines to maximize correctness, robustness, and maintainability:

1. **Preserve all identifiers and method signatures verbatim.**  
   Keep `self` explicitly where used, maintain decorators and type annotations exactly as shown.

2. **Enclose your entire translation within one Python code block starting with ```python and ending with ```.**  
   No comments unless strictly essential inline clarifications. No print/debug/explanatory statements outside the code block.

3. **Import all relevant standard library modules at the top, chosen proactively:**  
   Always include at least: `from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Set, Deque, Generator, Any`,  
   and from `collections`, `heapq`, `itertools`, `math` as needed, even if not immediately apparent in the pseudocode, for idiomatic, clean, and optimized Python.

4. **When handling serialized data structures as inputs (e.g., trees as lists with `null` or variants, linked lists, graphs, etc.):**  
   - Define all helper data classes (e.g., `TreeNode`, `ListNode`, `Node`, etc.) with complete type annotations and robust constructors.  
   - Implement **generic, reusable deserializers** for each kind of data structure appearing in the inputs that:  
     - Normalize null-like placeholders case-insensitively (`"null"`, `"Null"`, `"NULL"`, `"None"`, empty strings, and any similar representations) to Python `None`. This must be consistent throughout.  
     - Gracefully handle malformed or partial inputs (empty lists, trailing or intermediate nulls, repeated nulls) without exceptions.  
     - Convert from the normalized flat serialization into fully linked object graphs precisely matching the expected structure.  
   - When multiple serialized inputs exist in the same problem (e.g., `root1`, `root2`), define distinct deserializers dedicated to each input parameter name, guaranteeing no raw serialized input leaks into solution methods.

5. **All input deserializations (from raw serialized forms) must be done immediately inside the relevant class constructor or method, never outside or in global scope, so solution logic always works with well-typed objects.**

6. **Code quality and robustness:**  
   - Avoid name collisions by using clear, context-appropriate helper function/class names.  
   - Use type-safe patterns and idiomatic Python constructs.  
   - Process inputs lazily or iteratively when efficient.  
   - Fully validate or normalize inputs before usage, raising no unsolicited errors.  
   - Keep data class definitions minimal yet complete for serialization and deserialization correctness.

7. **Output must be a single contiguous Python script fulfilling all the above constraints, ready to run without errors on all valid and edge test inputs.**

Example structural snippet your code should include (adjusted to problem specifics):

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Set
import collections
import heapq
import itertools
import math

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, next: Optional['ListNode'] = None) -> None:
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deserialize_listnode(data: Optional[List[Optional[Any]]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    # Normalize all null representations to None
    # Build linked list accordingly robustly
    pass

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val: int=0, left: Optional['TreeNode']=None, right: Optional['TreeNode']=None) -> None:
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def deserialize_tree(data: Optional[List[Optional[Any]]]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
    # Normalize all null-like values to None
    # Build binary tree from list robustly breadth-first
    pass

class Solution:
    def methodName(self, param: InputType) -> ReturnType:
        # Deserialize inputs here if needed, e.g.
        # root = deserialize_tree(param)
        # Implementation here strictly on deserialized objects
        pass
```
