Translate the given pseudocode into fully runnable, clean, and efficient Python code that preserves all class and function names as provided in the pseudocode, maintaining the exact class and method structure. If the pseudocode uses classes like `Solution`, ensure the output code also defines them exactly as given. 

When the pseudocode implies usage of complex data structures (e.g., trees, linked lists) or input types that are lists or typical serialized forms (e.g., `[1,2,null,3]`), include helper functions or code snippets within the same code block that correctly convert these inputs into the required Python objects (e.g., TreeNode, ListNode). Assume `null` in pseudocode input corresponds to Python `None`. 

Use standard Python packages where appropriate for clarity and performance. Your code should run correctly within 5 seconds and avoid any unnecessary explanations or comments except minimal clarifications critical for readability. 

Always enclose the entire output strictly in a Python code block formatted as:

```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

No additional text, explanation, or separation lines outside the code block.
