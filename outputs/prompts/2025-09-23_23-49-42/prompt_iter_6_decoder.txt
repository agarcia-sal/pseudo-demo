Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, clean, and well-structured Python implementation, strictly preserving all function names, class names, and their hierarchical structures exactly as specified in the pseudocode. Your solution must:

- Enclose the entire code within a Python code block marked by ```python ... ```.
- Maintain original function signatures and class definitions without alteration.
- Produce code that is idiomatic, efficient, and readable, prioritizing correctness and clarity.
- Include any necessary imports to support your implementation; you may leverage any Python standard or widely-used third-party libraries as needed to optimize performance or simplicity.
- Avoid extraneous comments or separators; focus solely on delivering the final executable code.
- Complete execution logic within a 5-second runtime constraint.
- Assume the pseudocode fully describes the problem requirements; do not add assumptions beyond what is given.

Your response should be solely the Python code block implementing the pseudocode exactly as specified.
