Translate the provided code into clear, concise, and high-level pseudocode using natural language enriched with standard programming keywords (e.g., FUNCTION, FOR, IF, RETURN) and symbolic operators as needed. Maintain all original function and class names, including their object-oriented structure, without alterations. Express control flow and data manipulation explicitly but avoid low-level implementation details. The pseudocode should prioritize readability and abstraction over brevity, using descriptive but succinct variable names and phrases to emulate natural language fluency with moderate syllable complexity. Do not include any commentary, explanations, summaries, notes, or delimitersâ€”only the pseudocode itself. Preserve indentation or nesting equivalent to the original code structure for clarity. The output pseudocode should resemble structured, human-readable code that could guide implementation in any programming language.
