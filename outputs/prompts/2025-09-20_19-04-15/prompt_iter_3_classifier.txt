Given a piece of pseudocode, determine with absolute certainty whether it is **fully reproducible**, meaning it contains complete, explicit, and unambiguous instructions that guarantee passing **all** relevant unit tests without error, exception, or undefined behavior. Your thorough assessment must ensure the pseudocode:  

- Clearly defines inputs, outputs, and all intermediate states needed for correctness  
- Includes every necessary procedural step and logical condition without omissions or contradictions  
- Employs precise and valid operations, data structures, control flows, and function calls consistent with standard computational models  
- Correctly and explicitly handles all edge cases, boundary conditions, and relevant data types, with no implicit assumptions  
- Exhibits deterministic behavior with no randomness, side effects, or external dependencies unaccounted for in pseudocode  
- Uses consistent variable naming and scoping to avoid ambiguity or conflicts  
- When iterative or recursive, demonstrates termination guarantees and correctness of accumulation or return values  
- Does not rely on any unstated constructs, external knowledge, or hidden states beyond the pseudocode given  

Output a single digit only:  
- **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets all these criteria and can be confidently deemed reproducible for all relevant unit tests.  
- **0** otherwise (including missing steps, ambiguity, partial correctness, or undefined behaviors).  

Do not output anything besides this digit.  
If multiple pseudocodes are given sequentially, output their corresponding digits in order with no spaces, separators, or extra characters.
