Given the following pseudocode, determine whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”meaning it contains all necessary components (such as correct logic, clear input/output, defined operations, and no ambiguities) to pass all relevant unit tests without errors or missing steps. Output 1 if reproducible, otherwise output 0.  
Only output a single digit (1 or 0) and nothing else.
