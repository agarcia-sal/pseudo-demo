Given the pseudocode below, rigorously determine whether it is fully reproducible â€” that is, whether it explicitly and unambiguously includes all necessary components and correct logic for passing **all** relevant unit tests without error, exception, or missing steps. Specifically, verify these essential aspects:  

- Clear, well-defined inputs and outputs consistent with the intended functionality  
- Complete algorithmic logic without gaps, contradictions, or ambiguity in procedural steps  
- Precise and valid operations, including control flow, data structure manipulations, and function calls  
- Consistency and correctness in handling edge cases, boundary conditions, and data types  
- Absence of implicit assumptions or undefined behaviors  
- Properly managed state changes and side effects where applicable  

Only output a single digit:  
- **1** if you confirm the pseudocode meets all criteria for full reproducibility and correctness, ensuring it would pass all unit tests without failure.  
- **0** otherwise.  

Strictly produce only the digit (1 or 0), and nothing else.  
When multiple pseudocodes are evaluated, output the digits sequentially in the exact input order, with no separators or additional characters.
