Given a piece of pseudocode, determine **definitively and without ambiguity** if it is **fully reproducible**, meaning it provides a comprehensive, explicit, and unambiguous solution that guarantees passing **every relevant unit test** in its problem domain. Your assessment must rigorously check that the pseudocode satisfies all of the following criteria:

1. **Complete specification of inputs and outputs:** Inputs and outputs, including their formats and types, must be clearly stated or determinable from context without guesswork.

2. **Explicitness of all computation steps:** Every procedural action, decision point, and state transformation required for correctness is present with no missing or implied steps.

3. **Logical consistency and clarity:** Control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion) and data manipulation are logically correct, unambiguous, and precisely defined.

4. **Correct handling of all edge cases:** Boundary conditions, empty or minimal inputs, and special cases are explicitly addressed or clearly derivable.

5. **Deterministic and self-contained:** No operations rely on unspecified randomness, external resources, or hidden state not explicitly described in the pseudocode.

6. **Well-defined data structures and variables:** Variable names, scopes, and data structures must be consistent, non-conflicting, and clearly identify their role and content throughout execution.

7. **Termination and correctness guarantees:** For iterative or recursive procedures, there is clear evidence of guaranteed termination and correctness of returned or final results.

8. **No implicit assumptions or shortcuts:** The pseudocode does not depend on external knowledge, omitted details, or assumed behaviors beyond what is explicitly given.

9. **Standard computational model adherence:** Operations and constructs conform to typical algorithmic models and data manipulation conventions; no ambiguous or novel syntax without definition.

Your output must be a **single digit**:

- Output **1** if the pseudocode meets **all** the above criteria and can be confidently declared reproducible for all relevant unit tests without failure, error, exception, or undefined behavior.

- Output **0** otherwise (including cases with ambiguity, incompleteness, partial correctness, missing edge cases, or unclear logic).

If multiple pseudocodes are fed sequentially, output the corresponding sequence of digits in order with **no spaces, separators, or extra characters**.

Do **not** output anything besides this string of digits.

Focus your evaluation on the reproducibility with respect to passing **all** unit tests, ensuring thorough and strict scrutiny of every requirement for correctness, completeness, and unambiguity.
