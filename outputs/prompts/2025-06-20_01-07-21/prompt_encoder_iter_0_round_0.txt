Translate the given code into concise, high-level, easy-to-read pseudocode using natural language with symbolic representations and abbreviations where appropriate. Represent operations and control flow compactly, favoring one-liners and omitting details if it helps brevity. Do not include purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Format steps with line numbers and use assignment arrows (←), loops, and conditions clearly, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Aim for clarity and simplicity within a 5-second processing limit.
