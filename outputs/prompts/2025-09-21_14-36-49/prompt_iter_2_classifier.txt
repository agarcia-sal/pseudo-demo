Analyze the provided pseudocode carefully to determine whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”that is, whether it explicitly and unambiguously includes all necessary steps, variable and function definitions, and logical conditions required to pass every relevant unit test without omission. Your output must be a single digit: output **1** if the pseudocode is guaranteed to pass all unit tests (fully reproducible), or **0** if it is incomplete, ambiguous, or missing any critical component. Produce *only* the digit, with no explanations, comments, or additional text.
