Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Format each statement as a single line using step numbers and assignment arrows (e.g., “x ← 0”). Avoid purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations. The pseudocode should be understandable on its own and follow this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++
