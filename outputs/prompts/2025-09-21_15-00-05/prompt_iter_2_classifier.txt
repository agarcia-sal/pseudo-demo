Evaluate the reproducibility of the given pseudocode strictly according to whether it contains all necessary details, logic, and clarity needed to reliably pass every unit test based on its described functionality.  
Output **1** if it is fully reproducible with no ambiguity or missing information, or **0** if it lacks precision, completeness, or correctness essential for passing all tests.  
Do not output anything other than the digits **1** or **0**.  
Provide a single digit output per pseudocode input, corresponding exactly to the input order.
