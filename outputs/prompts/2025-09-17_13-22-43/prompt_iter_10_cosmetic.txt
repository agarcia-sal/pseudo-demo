Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a rewritten version that preserves **all original functionality, outputs, and interfaces exactly**, while being **maximally dissimilar in syntax, structure, and style**. Your output must adhere strictly to the following requirements:

- Keep **all class names, function names, method signatures, and the complete original class/object hierarchy and nesting unchanged**; no modifications to interfaces or organization.
- Change everything else as much as possible, including but not limited to:
  - Variable names, temporary identifiers, and parameter names (use completely different names with consistent renaming).
  - Control flow mechanisms: transform loops to alternative forms (for ↔ while, iteration ↔ recursion), invert loop directions, unroll or roll loops differently.
  - Restructure conditionals: change if-else to switch/case if plausible, reorder conditions, use logically equivalent but distinct expressions.
  - Manipulate data structures: switch array types, reorder elements, replace indexing with iterators or vice versa, use alternate but equivalent data representations.
  - Expression rewrites: expand or factor expressions, replace arithmetic/logical operations with equivalent formulations, split complex expressions into simpler steps or consolidate simple ones.
  - Refactor sequences of statements by reordering independent statements, introduce helper sub-blocks within the same function if it helps structural diversity.
  - Change code layout, indentation style, and formatting generously—use varied whitespace and line breaks while maintaining readability.
- Preserve all original comments, docstrings, and inline explanatory text exactly as-is (do not add, remove, or modify comments).
- Do **not** introduce any new functionality or change existing behavior in any manner.
- The output must be a syntactically valid, seamless pseudocode replacement for the original snippet.

**Output only the fully rewritten pseudocode. No explanations, headers, or extra text.**
