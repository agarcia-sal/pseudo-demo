Given the input pseudocode, create a rewritten version that preserves **all original functionality exactly** but transforms the code to be as syntactically and structurally different as possible. To achieve this:

- Keep all **class names**, **function names**, **and the original class and object hierarchy exactly the same**.
- Focus on changing variable names, control flow constructs, loop styles, ordering of logically independent operations, condition expressions, and data structure usages — without altering logic.
- Use alternative expressions, synonymous statements, different idiomatic constructs, and varied formatting/styles.
- Avoid adding explanatory comments or any text beyond the rewritten pseudocode itself.
- Ensure the output contains **only the rewritten pseudocode**, nothing else, no prose or explanation.

Your goal is to **maximize dissimilarity** from the original pseudocode’s wording and structure while guaranteeing identical functional behavior, class/function signatures, and organization.
