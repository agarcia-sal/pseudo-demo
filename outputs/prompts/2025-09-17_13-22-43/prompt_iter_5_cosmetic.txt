Given the input pseudocode, generate a functionally equivalent pseudocode version that maximizes syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence from the original, **while strictly preserving all original behaviors, class names, function names, and the exact class/object hierarchy.**

To do this, adhere to these key guidelines:

- **Do not change any class names, function names, or their nesting/organization in classes or objects. Retain all signatures and hierarchies exactly.**
- **Rewrite all variable names completely, except those that are function or class names. Use distinct, consistent aliases.**
- Refactor control flow by:
  - Replacing loops with equivalent alternatives (e.g., for → while, while → for, recursion where possible).
  - Transforming conditionals (if/else chains → switch/case or vice versa, flattening nested conditions, changing logical operator order without altering logic).
  - Reordering statements that are logically independent.
- Replace data structure representations where possible without changing semantics (e.g., lists ↔ arrays; maps ↔ dictionaries).
- Replace literal constants, numeric or string expressions with equivalent expressions (e.g., `length(s)` ↔ `len(s)`, or `x != 0` ↔ `not (x == 0)`).
- Use synonymous language constructs and idiomatic alternatives (e.g., "append" ↔ "add," "increment" ↔ "+= 1").
- Change formatting, indentation styles, line breaks, and statement grouping significantly.
- Do not introduce any new comments, explanatory text, or output beyond the rewritten pseudocode.
- **The output must contain only the rewritten pseudocode, starting immediately, and nothing else—no surrounding explanation or commentary.**

Your objective is to produce an output pseudocode that:

- Preserves **precise original functionality and all side effects**.
- Leaves class and function names **completely unchanged and in original structure**.
- Maximizes dissimilarity in all other code aspects, ensuring the code looks as distinct as possible from the input.

This transformation should be careful and thorough to minimize semantic or runtime differences while pushing maximum syntactic and stylistic variation.
