Given any input pseudocode snippet, generate a functionally equivalent pseudocode version that **preserves the exact same behavior, outputs, interfaces, class names, function names, method signatures, and overall class/object hierarchy as in the original**, while achieving **maximum possible syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence**. Your rewritten pseudocode must:

- Keep all class definitions, their names, and nesting structures unchanged.
- Maintain function and method names, their parameters (names and order), and signatures exactly as given.
- Do **not** add, remove, or alter any comments or explanatory text.
- Thoroughly transform all other elements, including but not limited to:
  - Renaming every local variable, temporary variable, and identifier consistently but differently.
  - Converting control flow styles (e.g., rewrite `for` loops as `while` loops, or replace loops with recursion, and vice versa).
  - Changing loop directions and iteration orders wherever possible.
  - Reformulating conditional expressions and branching (e.g., swap branches, use De Morgan’s laws, replace multi-way branches by nested if-elses).
  - Altering data structures representation and access methods (e.g., arrays ↔ lists, using maps/dictionaries if suitable, changing indexing styles).
  - Reordering independent, order-insensitive operations to differ structurally.
  - Expanding or contracting expressions using logically equivalent transformations, alternative idioms, and language-agnostic pseudocode constructs.
  - Modifying formatting, indentation, spacing, and stylistic elements to differ substantially, while maintaining readability.
- Ensure the output pseudocode is syntactically well-formed, logically valid, and could seamlessly replace the input without impacting correctness or interface expectations.
- Avoid introducing any additional helper functions or classes beyond what exists in the original pseudocode, unless replacing existing constructs with equivalent alternate patterns inline.
- Your output must contain **only the transformed pseudocode**, with none of your process explanation, notes, or comments.

**The objective is to maximize all forms of divergence—lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic—while preserving perfect equivalence in functionality, output, and interface, including exact preservation of all class and function signatures.**

Output solely the rewritten pseudocode fragment.
