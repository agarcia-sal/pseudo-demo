Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a rewritten version that preserves **all original semantics, outputs, side effects, and interfaces exactly as provided**, including **all class names, function and method names, method signatures, and the entire class/object hierarchy and structure unchanged**. Your output must be strictly pseudocode and only pseudocode—no explanations or commentary.

To maximize difference from the original while ensuring perfect equivalence, apply transformations such as:

- Rename all variables, loop indices, and temporary identifiers arbitrarily but consistently.
- Replace all control flow constructs with equivalent alternatives (e.g., transform `for` loops into `while` loops, convert iterative loops into recursion or vice versa).
- Alter loop increment directions and ordering wherever possible.
- Change conditional statements into logically equivalent forms, including De Morgan’s laws, ternary-style conditions, nested conditions, or inverted logic.
- Substitute data structures with others that maintain identical behavior (e.g., maps instead of arrays, lists instead of queues), or reorganize logically independent operations to different sequences.
- Expand or factor expressions, rewrite arithmetic and boolean expressions into equivalent but syntactically diverse forms.
- Modify function call styles, such as introducing helper functions or inlining short operations if it maintains interface consistency.
- Vary formatting, indentation, spacing, line breaks, and naming conventions liberally to maximize lexical and stylistic divergence, provided readability and correctness remain intact.
- Maintain all comments, docstrings, and annotations exactly as in the original, without adding or removing any.

Your generated pseudocode must form a valid, directly substitutable snippet that could replace the original without any integration or behavioral issues.

**Output only the transformed pseudocode—no prose, no commentary, no debugging or validation notes.**
