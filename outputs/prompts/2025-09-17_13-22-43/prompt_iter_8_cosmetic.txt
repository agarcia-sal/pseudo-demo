Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a rewritten version that is functionally identical—producing the same outputs, side effects, and maintaining the exact interface—while achieving maximum syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence from the original. Your output must adhere strictly to these rules:

1. Preserve exactly all class names, function names, method signatures, return values, and the original class/object hierarchy and structure. These must not be renamed, reordered, or omitted.

2. Rewrite every other aspect of the pseudocode to be as different as possible, including, but not limited to:
   - Renaming all variable names, loop counters, parameters, and temporary identifiers to entirely new, consistent alternatives.
   - Replacing all loops with equivalent constructs of a different form (e.g., convert `for` loops to `while` loops, or to recursion when natural).
   - Reversing loop orders where semantically permissible.
   - Reorganizing control flow by swapping conditional statement structures—using nested vs. flat conditions, combining or decomposing expressions into multiple statements, or applying logically equivalent but distinct boolean expressions.
   - Substituting one data structure or representation style for another (e.g., switching arrays to lists, maps, sets, or tuples), or changing the way collections are manipulated (e.g., using insertion instead of appending).
   - Altering expressions by expanding or contracting arithmetic/boolean operations, using equivalent idioms or refactoring compound expressions into simpler or more complex forms.
   - Modifying all formatting, indentation, ordering of logically independent steps, and comment positioning without losing clarity or correctness.
   - Employing alternative, yet equivalent algorithms or approaches for the same functional effect if possible.
   
3. Do **not** add, remove, or modify any comments or explanatory text from the original input. Your output must contain **only** the rewritten pseudocode and maintain all existing comments **exactly as given and in their original places**.

4. Ensure the rewritten pseudocode is syntactically valid and can directly replace the original snippet without any behavioral or interface change.

5. The output must be exclusively the rewritten pseudocode text without any additional explanation, rationale, or non-pseudocode content.

Your objective is to **maximize the difference in wording, structure, algorithmic expression, and style while guaranteeing identical correctness, output, and interface.**

Output only the fully rewritten pseudocode.
