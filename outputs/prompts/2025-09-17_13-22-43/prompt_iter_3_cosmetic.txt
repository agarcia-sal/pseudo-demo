Given the input pseudocode, produce a fully rewritten version that differs as much as possible from the original in terms of structure, syntax, variable naming, control flow, formatting, and styleâ€”while strictly preserving the exact original functionality, algorithmic logic, and semantics. Maintain all original function names, class names, and their placement within the class and object hierarchy without any changes. You must not add explanations, comments, or any text aside from the rewritten pseudocode itself. Ensure the code remains self-contained, logically equivalent, and executable under the same assumptions, but leverage diverse programming constructs, alternative control statements, reorderings where safe, different data structure notations, and varied idiomatic expressions to maximize syntactic divergence. The output should consist solely of the transformed pseudocode, formatted cleanly and consistently.
