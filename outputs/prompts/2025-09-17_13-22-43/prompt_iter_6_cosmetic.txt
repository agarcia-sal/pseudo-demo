Given the input pseudocode, produce a transformed version that strictly preserves **all original semantics, behaviors, and outputs** without exception, while exhibiting maximal syntactic and structural divergence from the input. Observe these requirements precisely:

- Maintain all **original class names**, **function names**, and the **exact class and object hierarchies** intact — do not rename or reorder them.
- Thoroughly vary variable identifiers (rename consistently), reorder or restructure logically independent code segments, and rewrite control flows (e.g., convert between different loop constructs, replace conditionals with equivalent logical expressions, alter branching style).
- Replace explicit expressions with logically equivalent alternatives; leverage different idiomatic constructs or rewrite algorithms using alternative but equivalent approaches where applicable.
- Alter data structure representations or usages if possible without changing outcomes (e.g., lists ⇄ arrays ⇄ stacks, representations of empty/zero values).
- Vary formatting, spacing, and indentation style for further stylistic differences, ensuring clarity and correctness.
- Do not add, remove, or modify any functionality, logic, operations, or interfaces.
- Do not include explanatory comments, annotations, or or any text other than the pseudocode; the output must be only the rewritten pseudocode.
- Keep the overall program organization and interfaces identical, outputting strictly pseudocode.
- Strive to radically maximize lexical, syntactic, and structural difference compared to the input while ensuring the rewritten code passes rigorous equivalence testing against the original.

Your output must contain **only** the rewritten pseudocode — nothing else.
