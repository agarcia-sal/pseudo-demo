Given the input pseudocode, generate a rewritten version that preserves all original semantics and functionality exactly but differs maximally in presentation, control flow, variable naming, structure, and style. Your transformation should include — but is not limited to — reordering statements where safe, using alternative control constructs (e.g., replacing FOR loops with WHILE loops or vice versa), changing variable names and intermediate expressions, flattening or introducing nesting differently, and varying expression styles, without altering logical flow or output.

**Constraints:**

- Retain all original function names, class names, and their hierarchy and organizational structure exactly as in the input.
- Do not add or remove any functions, classes, or data members.
- Maintain all original input/output behavior, side effects, and algorithmic intent perfectly.
- Your output must include only the rewritten pseudocode — no explanations, comments, or extraneous text.
- Apply idiomatic but diverse pseudocode constructs and fresh style choices to maximize syntactic and structural difference while preserving meaning.

Strive to produce a functionally equivalent pseudocode variant that would result in identical behavior if implemented, but looks and reads as distinctively as possible from the original.
