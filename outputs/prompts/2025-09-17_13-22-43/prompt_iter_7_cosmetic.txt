Given an input pseudocode snippet, rewrite it to produce a version that retains **exactly the same functional behavior, outputs, and interface**, while being **maximally distinct syntactically and structurally** from the original. Your rewritten pseudocode must:

- Preserve all **class names, function names, method signatures, and the original class / object hierarchy exactly as in the input**.
- Alter all other details extensively, including but not limited to:
  - Variable and temporary identifier names
  - Control flow constructs (e.g., replace `for` loops by `while` loops or recursion)
  - Loop directions and styles
  - Conditional statement forms and expression arrangements
  - Data structures usage and representations (e.g., change arrays to lists or maps, or reorder logically independent operations)
  - Expression simplifications and expansions, use of equivalent idioms or language constructs
  - Formatting, indentation, and stylistic variations (while preserving readability)
- Avoid adding, removing, or modifying any comments, explanatory text, or output—your output must contain **only** the rewritten pseudocode.
- Your output must be a well-formed pseudocode fragment that could replace the original snippet seamlessly.
  
The goal is to **maximize lexical, structural, and stylistic divergence from the original pseudocode, without compromising any correctness, output, or interface constraints**.

Output only the fully rewritten pseudocode—do not include any explanation, rationale, or prose.
