Rewrite the provided pseudocode to create a functionally equivalent version that is maximally different in syntax, structure, and flow. Retain exactly the same function names, class names, and maintain the original class and object organization without any modifications. Use varied control structures, reorder independent statements where possible, rename variables internally if needed (but never change function or class identifiers), and alter indentation or formatting styles to maximize dissimilarity. Your output must consist solely of the rewritten pseudocodeâ€”no explanations, comments, or additional text.
