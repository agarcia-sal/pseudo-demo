Given the pseudocode below, determine **with high confidence** whether it is fully reproducibleâ€”that is, whether the pseudocode is complete, logically consistent, unambiguous, and sufficiently detailed to pass all standard unit tests for its described behavior without external assumptions. Your assessment should consider control flow, variable initialization, data structure usage, boundary conditions, and the clarity of all operations. 

Output only a single integer, **1** if the pseudocode meets these reproducibility criteria, or **0** if it does not. Do not include explanation, formatting, or any other text.

Evaluate each provided pseudocode snippet independently and produce a string of outputs corresponding exactly in order to the order of pseudocodes received, with no delimiters or spaces.
