Write concise, easy-to-read pseudocode in a compact, high-level style using natural language, one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow this numbered step format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity. Your pseudocode should be understandable without extra notes. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best possible results within this limit.
