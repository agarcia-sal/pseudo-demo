Write concise, compact pseudocode that is easy to read and understand, using a high-level style with predominantly natural language, symbolic representations, abbreviations, and one-liners whenever possible. Do not include any purpose statements, summaries, explanations, comments, or clarifications—only the pseudocode itself. Use a simple numbered step format as shown below, without any separator lines or extra spacing:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Make the pseudocode self-contained and clear without additional notes. Focus on brevity while preserving clarity. Use meaningful variable names but prefer succinctness. When appropriate, use control structures in one line. Assume standard programming constructs are understood. Your output should resemble the following style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers with size n  
read n elements into A  
for i from 0 to size(A)-1  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j from i+1 to size(A)-1  
  if A[min_i] > A[j]: min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
