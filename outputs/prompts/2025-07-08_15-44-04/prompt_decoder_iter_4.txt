Translate the given pseudocode into clean, well-structured, and efficient Python code that executes within 5 seconds.  
- Use only `input()` for all inputs without any prompt strings.  
- Do not include any explanation, comments, or extraneous text outside the code.  
- Enclose your entire output in a single Python code block with triple backticks and the `python` language tag, like this:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

- You may import and use any standard Python libraries if needed.  
- Make sure your code handles inputs and outputs exactly as implied by the pseudocode, and prioritize clarity, correctness, and performance.  
- Avoid writing separator lines or additional formatting beyond the required code block.
