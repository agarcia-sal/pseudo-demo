Write concise, compact, high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand. Use natural language mixed with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Express logic mainly in one-liners to keep it brief yet clear. Do not include any purpose statements, summaries, explanations, comments, or clarifications—only the pseudocode itself. Present steps in a simple numbered format as shown below:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Use clear control structures (if, while, for, function) in a minimalistic style. Output the pseudocode as a sequence of numbered instructions that flows logically and can be followed without additional notes.

Example of desired style:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for all elements in A  
 set min_i to i  
 for j = i+1 to size of A exclusive  
  set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
