Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code.  
- Preserve all function names exactly as defined in the pseudocode.  
- Your output must include **only** the Python code enclosed within a single triple-backtick code block labeled `python`, like this:  
```python  
# Your translated Python code here  
```  
- Write code optimized for clarity, performance, and correctness, capable of running within 5 seconds.  
- You may use Python standard libraries and any widely accepted third-party packages if they improve efficiency or readability, but avoid unnecessary imports.  
- Avoid adding comments, explanations, or any text other than the precise code requested.  
- Make sure your implementation strictly follows the logic and control flow described in the pseudocode, handling all cases implicitly or explicitly.
