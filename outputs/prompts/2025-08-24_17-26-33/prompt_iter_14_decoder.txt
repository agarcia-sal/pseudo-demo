Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and highly efficient Python code that strictly follows the described logic and structure.  
- Use the **exact** function and variable names as provided in the pseudocode—do not rename or alter them.  
- Your output must consist **exclusively** of the final Python code inside a single fenced code block labeled `python`, formatted precisely like this:  
```python  
# Your translated Python code here  
```  
- Optimize for readability and performance while ensuring full correctness and careful handling of all control flow, edge cases, and data types as implied or explicitly stated.  
- You may freely use any modules from Python’s standard library or well-known third-party libraries if they improve clarity or speed, but avoid unnecessary imports.  
- Do **not** include comments, explanations, print statements, or any text outside the code block—only pure executable Python code that implements the pseudocode exactly.  
- Minimize redundant operations and data structures; produce concise, maintainable, production-ready code designed for execution within a 5-second timeout.
