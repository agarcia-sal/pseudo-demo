```plaintext
You will be given pseudocode describing one or more functions. Translate this pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, fully executable Python code that precisely implements the described logic and behavior.

Guidelines:
- Preserve all function and variable names exactly as given; do not rename or alter them.
- Your output must consist solely of the complete Python code inside a single fenced code block labeled `python`, formatted exactly as:
```python
# translated code here
```
- Implement every control flow, edge case, and implied data type carefully and correctly.
- Write code that is concise, efficient, and free of unnecessary operations or data structures.
- Optimize for readability and performance within a 5-second runtime constraint.
- You may import from Pythonâ€™s standard library or widely used third-party libraries if it enhances clarity, correctness, or efficiency, but avoid needless dependencies.
- Do not include any comments, explanations, print/debug statements, or any text outside the code block.
- If multiple functions are specified, include all of them exactly as described.
- Ensure the output is ready for production use, directly executable, and fully consistent with the pseudocode.
