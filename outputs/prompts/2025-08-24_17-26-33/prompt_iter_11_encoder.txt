Generate concise, clear pseudocode that implements the given problem exactly, using the original function name.  
Write the pseudocode as a logically ordered list of numbered steps, using natural language enhanced by standard symbols and common abbreviations to keep it compact, clear, and at a high-level.  
Favor short one-line statements without losing clarity or flow. Use idiomatic pseudocode conventions consistently, minimal punctuation, and no extra formatting or separators.  
Include all necessary logic so the pseudocode can be understood and implemented directly.  
Do not add explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode.  
Preserve the original function name in its definition and calls.  
Follow exactly this formatting style:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure the pseudocode reads naturally, is easy to follow, and completes within a 5-second generation time.
