Translate the provided pseudocode into correct, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that faithfully preserves all functions and identifiers exactly as named in the pseudocode.  
- Your output must consist **exclusively** of Python code enclosed within a single triple-backtick code block labeled `python`, as shown below:  
```python  
# Translated Python code here  
```  
- Follow the pseudocode logic and control flow rigorously, covering all cases implicitly or explicitly, without introducing behavior not described.  
- Prioritize clarity, correctness, and performance within a 5-second runtime constraint for any valid input.  
- You may import and use any standard Python library or widely accepted third-party package that demonstrably improves code quality or efficiency, but avoid unnecessary imports.  
- Do not include comments, explanations, or any text outside the required code blockâ€”only the precise code is allowed.  
- Emphasize Pythonic and idiomatic constructs, concise but readable expressions, and best practices for algorithms and data structures.  
- Avoid any formatting or extra lines beyond the single requested code block.
