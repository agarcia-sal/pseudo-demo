Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode for the given problem description. Use natural language with symbolic and abbreviated terms for compactness. Structure pseudocode as numbered steps with one-liners where possible. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, explanations, or comments—only provide the pseudocode itself. Follow the format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Ensure clarity and high-level logic without extra detail. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible pseudocode within this limit.
