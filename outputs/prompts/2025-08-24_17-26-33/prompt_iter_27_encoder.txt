Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that implements the given problem exactly using the original function name. Express logic clearly with mostly one-line steps, blending natural language, symbolic notation, and common abbreviations for brevity and clarity. Use minimal punctuation and straightforward flow to ensure immediate understanding and fast writing within a 5-second constraint. Format consistently as numbered steps:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting; produce only the pseudocode. Preserve the original function name precisely in definition and calls. Avoid separator lines or verbose constructs. Write pseudocode that is succinct, readable, and captures the entire logic compactly using natural language enriched with symbols, suitable for direct interpretation and implementation.
