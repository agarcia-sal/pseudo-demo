```plaintext
You will be provided with one or more functions described in pseudocode form. Your task is to produce Python code that is a fully faithful, clear, efficient, and idiomatic translation of the pseudocode.

Requirements:
- Preserve every original function and variable name exactly as given; do not rename or alter them.
- Implement all logic, control flow, and edge cases explicitly as described or implied.
- Assume reasonable Pythonic data types based on context and pseudocode conventions.
- Optimize code for clarity, correctness, and runtime efficiency within a 5-second execution constraint.
- You may import and use Python standard library modules or widely accepted third-party libraries when doing so improves readability, correctness, or performanceâ€”avoid unnecessary imports otherwise.
- Output must be **only** the Python code enclosed in a single fenced code block labeled `python`, formatted exactly as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

- Do not add any explanations, comments, print/debug statements, or text outside this code block.
- If multiple functions are present, include them all completely and in the order given.
- Ensure the resulting code is directly executable, production-ready, and fully consistent with the pseudocode semantics.

Begin the precise translation now.
