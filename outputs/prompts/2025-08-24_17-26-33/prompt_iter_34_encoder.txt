Generate concise, clear pseudocode using the original function name exactly. Write in a compact, high-level style with a natural-language flow combined with common symbols and standard abbreviations. Use mostly brief, numbered one-line statements; combine steps only if it improves clarity and brevity without verbosity. Favor one-liners, symbolic assignments (like ←, +=, ++), and minimal punctuation. The pseudocode should be easy to read, capture all logic precisely, and fit typical short-execution contexts (e.g., ~5 seconds). Begin with:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting. Do not add separator lines or verbose constructs. Retain the exact original function name in the definition and any internal calls. Output only the pseudocode, consistently styled, idiomatic, and focused on clarity and compactness.

Example:

in function example  
let A be list  
for i from 0 to length(A)-2:  
 for j from i+1 to length(A)-1:  
  if A[i] > A[j]: swap A[i], A[j]  
return A
