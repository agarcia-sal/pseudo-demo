Generate clear, concise pseudocode that faithfully implements the given problem using the original function name exactly as in the source. The pseudocode must be easy to read and understand, blending natural language with common symbolic notations and standard abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level.  

Express all steps in numbered order, preferring succinct one-line statements without losing logical flow or readability. Use minimal punctuation and consistent idiomatic pseudocode style. Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or any formatting beyond the numbered steps—no separator lines or extra whitespace.  

Keep the function header as in the original code when defining or calling the function. Emphasize direct, efficient logic suitable for quick comprehension and implementation within 5 seconds.  

Follow this exact format:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Output only the pseudocode.
