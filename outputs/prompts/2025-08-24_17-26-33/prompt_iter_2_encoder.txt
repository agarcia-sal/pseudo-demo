Generate concise, clear, and high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand for the given problem description. Keep the original function name intact. Use natural language enriched with symbolic notations and abbreviations for brevity. Write the pseudocode as numbered steps, preferring one-line statements whenever possible. Avoid any explanations, summaries, comments, or purpose statements—output only the pseudocode. Emphasize compactness, logical flow, and clarity without unnecessary detail.

Follow this format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. Focus on producing polished, idiomatic pseudocode that balances readability and succinctness within the 5-second generation limit.
