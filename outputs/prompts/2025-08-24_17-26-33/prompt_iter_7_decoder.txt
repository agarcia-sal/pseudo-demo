Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and performant Python code that strictly preserves the original function names.  
- Your output must be **only** the Python code enclosed in a single triple-backtick block labeled `python`, like:  
```python  
# translated Python code here  
```  
- The code should implement exactly the logic and control flow described in the pseudocode with full correctness and completeness.  
- Prioritize clarity, efficiency, and robustness; your solution must run within 5 seconds.  
- You may freely use Python standard libraries or well-known third-party packages to enhance readability or performance, but avoid any unused or unnecessary imports.  
- Do not provide any comments, explanations, docstrings, or additional textâ€”only the minimal required runnable Python code.  
- Keep all variable and function names exactly as given in the pseudocode.  
- Always handle edge cases implicitly or explicitly so behavior matches the pseudocode semantics fully.  
- Assume input types and formats as implied by the pseudocode; implement type-appropriate idiomatic Python code reflecting those assumptions.
