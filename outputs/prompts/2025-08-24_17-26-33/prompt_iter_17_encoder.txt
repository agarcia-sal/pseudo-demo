Generate clear, concise pseudocode that directly implements the given problem using its original function name. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understand, blending natural language with compact symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to maintain a high-level, succinct style. Express all steps in sequentially numbered, mostly one-line statements that preserve logic and flow without unnecessary detail. Use consistent, idiomatic pseudocode conventions, minimal punctuation, and no explanations or extra formatting. Do not include comments, summaries, or separator lines. Preserve the exact original function name at its definition and in calls.

Follow exactly this format:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode reads naturally, covers the full logic, and is suitable for rapid comprehension and direct translation within a 5-second generation time.
