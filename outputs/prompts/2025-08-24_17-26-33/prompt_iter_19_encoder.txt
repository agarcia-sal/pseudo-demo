Generate concise, compact pseudocode that directly implements the given problem using the exact original function name. The pseudocode must be clear and easy to read, written in natural language enriched with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to maintain a high-level, succinct style. Express all logic in numbered steps, preferring brief one-line statements, combining related operations when it preserves clarity and flow.

Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting. Do not add separator lines or verbose constructs. Use minimal punctuation and idiomatic pseudocode conventions consistently. Preserve the original function name exactly at definition and calls.

Follow precisely this style:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode flows naturally, captures all necessary logic efficiently, and uses common pseudocode idioms suitable for quick comprehension and direct implementation within 5 seconds.
