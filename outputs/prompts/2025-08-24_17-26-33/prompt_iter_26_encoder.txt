Generate clear, concise pseudocode that directly implements the given problem using the exact original function name. Write the pseudocode in a compact, high-level style combining natural language with standard symbols and abbreviations. Use mostly brief one-line statements in numbered steps, merging related actions only if clarity and flow improve. Prefer idiomatic, minimal punctuation and keep the structure straightforward for immediate comprehension and fast implementation.

Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting; do not add separator lines or verbose constructs. Preserve the original function name exactly in the definition and any calls. Use a clean, consistent style as follows:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode is readable, succinct, and captures all logic efficiently, using natural language enriched with symbolic notation suitable for direct use within a 5-second runtime constraint.
