Translate the provided pseudocode into idiomatic, clean, and efficient Python code that precisely implements the described logic and control flow.  
- Use exactly the same function names as in the pseudocode without alteration.  
- Your output must contain **only** the Python code within a single fenced code block labeled `python`, formatted like this:  
```python  
# Translated Python code here  
```  
- Prioritize code clarity, correctness, and optimal performance within a 5-second execution constraint.  
- You may import and use any standard Python libraries or widely accepted third-party packages if they improve efficiency or readability, but avoid unnecessary imports.  
- Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or extra outputâ€”only the pure Python code that fully realizes the pseudocode specification.  
- Carefully handle all control structures, edge cases, and data types exactly as implied or explicitly stated in the pseudocode.  
- Avoid redundant computations or data structures; produce concise and maintainable code suitable for immediate execution.
