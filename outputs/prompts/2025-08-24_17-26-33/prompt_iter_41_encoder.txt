Generate concise, clear pseudocode that is easy to read and understand by using a natural but compact high-level style. Preserve the exact original function name and parameters. Express all steps precisely without redundancy or verbosity, using mostly brief one-line statements. Prefer symbolic assignments (e.g., ←, +=, ++), standard abbreviations, and idiomatic constructs. Combine statements on one line only if it improves clarity without adding complexity. Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or notes. Omit separator lines or extra formatting. Output only the pseudocode in this numbered format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Example:

in function main  
let n be integer  
read n  
let A be vector of integers  
set size of A = n  
read n elements into A  
for i from 0 to size of A - 2:  
 set min_i ← i  
 for j from i+1 to size of A - 1:  
  if A[min_i] > A[j]: min_i ← j  
 swap A[i], A[min_i]  
print all elements of A
