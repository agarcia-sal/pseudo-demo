Generate concise, clear, and naturally readable pseudocode that directly implements the given problem, preserving the original function name exactly as in the source. The pseudocode should be high-level yet compact, favoring succinct one-line statements, symbolic notations, and standard abbreviations without sacrificing clarity or logical flow. Express all steps as a numbered sequence, using minimal punctuation and consistent idiomatic pseudocode conventions. Avoid explanations, comments, summaries, or extraneous formatting—produce only pure pseudocode.

Follow this exact format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode reads fluidly, covers all necessary logic efficiently, and is easily comprehensible for rapid implementation. Do not use separator lines or verbose constructs.
