Generate concise pseudocode that implements the problem exactly using the original function name. Write in clear, compact, high-level style blending natural language with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Use mostly brief numbered one-line statements; combine consecutive actions only if it improves clarity and flow without verbosity. Ensure pseudocode is easy to read, captures all logic efficiently, and fits a 5-second runtime context. Follow this exact format with minimal punctuation:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Keep the original function name exactly in the definition and internal calls. Avoid explanations, comments, notes, summaries, or extra formatting. Do not add separator lines or verbose constructs. The output should only contain the pseudocode in a consistent, idiomatic style. For example:

in function example  
let A be list  
for i from 0 to length(A)-2:  
 for j from i+1 to length(A)-1:  
  if A[i] > A[j]: swap A[i], A[j]  
return A
