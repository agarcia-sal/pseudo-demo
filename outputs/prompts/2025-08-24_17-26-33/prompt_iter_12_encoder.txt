Generate precise, compact pseudocode that directly implements the given problem using the original function name exactly as provided. Write the pseudocode in clear, natural language enriched with standard symbolic notations and common abbreviations to achieve brevity without losing clarity. Express the entire logic through numbered sequential steps, favoring succinct single-line statements and in-line conditions, while maintaining readability and a logical high-level flow.

Do not include explanations, comments, summaries, or any output besides the pseudocode itself. Avoid separator lines or verbose formatting. Use minimalist punctuation and consistent idiomatic pseudocode conventions. Preserve the exact original function name at its definition or usage.

Format the pseudocode as follows, ensuring it reads naturally and covers all necessary steps efficiently:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++

The output must be immediately usable and understandable, designed for rapid comprehension and implementation within 5 seconds.
