Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that directly implements the given problem using the exact original function name. The pseudocode must be clear, easy to read, and compact—expressing logic in mostly one-line steps that combine related operations when clarity allows. Favor natural language with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it succinct and immediate to understand.

Number each step, starting from 1, following this format precisely (with consistent indentation for nested blocks):

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Always preserve the original function name exactly at its definition and calls. Use idiomatic pseudocode conventions, minimal punctuation, and no extra formatting or explanatory text. Do not include comments, summaries, separators, or notes—output only the pseudocode steps.

Ensure the pseudocode flows naturally, captures all logic efficiently, uses common concise idioms, and is readable within 5 seconds for quick implementation.
