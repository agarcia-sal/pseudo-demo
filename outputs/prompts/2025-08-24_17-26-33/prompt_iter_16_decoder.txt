Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional, production-quality Python code that strictly adheres to the following requirements:

- Implement exactly the logic and structure described, **keeping all function and variable names unchanged**.
- Deliver a **single, complete Python script or function** (or minimal set of functions if pseudocode suggests multiple) that can be executed as-is without any modifications.
- Enclose your entire output **only** within one fenced code block marked with `python` like this:  
```python
# your code here
```
- Precisely handle all specified control flows, edge cases, and data types as implied or explicitly stated in the pseudocode.
- Optimize for clean, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that respects a strict 5-second runtime limit for realistic use cases.
- Avoid any unused variables, imports, or redundant computations; use only Python standard library or well-known third-party libraries **only if** they clearly improve correctness, readability, or performance.
- Do not include comments, explanations, print/debug statements, or any other text outside the code block.
- Favor clarity and simplicity, but never compromise correctness or fidelity to the pseudocode semantics.
- If the pseudocode lacks explicit detail on certain behaviors, infer sensible, minimal assumptions aligned with common Python conventions.

Your output must be **only** such executable Python code in a single fenced code block labeled `python`.
