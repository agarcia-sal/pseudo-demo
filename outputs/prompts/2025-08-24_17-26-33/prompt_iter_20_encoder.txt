Generate concise, high-level pseudocode that implements the given problem using exactly the original function name. Write the pseudocode in clear, natural language with symbolic notation and standard abbreviations to keep it compact and easy to read. Express all logic as numbered steps, favoring brief one-line statements that combine related operations when clarity allows. Use idiomatic pseudocode conventions consistently, including common constructs like ← for assignment, simple loop ranges, and minimal punctuation.

Output only the pseudocode without explanations, comments, summaries, or extra formatting. Preserve the original function name exactly in the definition and all calls. Do not include separator lines or verbose constructs.

Follow precisely this style and formatting:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Ensure the pseudocode flows naturally, efficiently captures all necessary logic, and remains highly readable for quick comprehension and direct implementation within 5 seconds.
