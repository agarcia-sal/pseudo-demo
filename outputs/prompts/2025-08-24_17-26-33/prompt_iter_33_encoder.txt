Generate concise, readable pseudocode that directly implements the problem using the original function name exactly. Use clear, mostly one-line numbered statements mixing simple natural language with standard symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Write compact, high-level code: combine steps only when it improves flow without adding verbosity. Prefer one-liners with minimal punctuation, no comments, explanations, or formatting besides numbering. Keep variable naming simple and consistent, avoid verbose constructs. Follow this strict format exactly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Output only the pseudocode in this style, no extra text or separators. For example:

in function example  
let A be list  
for i from 0 to length(A)-2:  
 for j from i+1 to length(A)-1:  
  if A[i] > A[j]: swap A[i], A[j]  
return A
