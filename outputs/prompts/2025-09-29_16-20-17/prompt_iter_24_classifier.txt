Given an arbitrary pseudocode describing an algorithm, determine if it is fully explicit, unambiguous, and logically complete so that a competent programmer can implement it *directly* into correct, runnable code that will pass **all** unit tests relevant to the functionality it purports to perform. Specifically, verify that the pseudocode:

- Clearly specifies all inputs and their handling;
- Defines every necessary variable and initialization;
- Uses well-defined and correctly scoped control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion if applicable) without logical or off-by-one errors;
- Manipulates data as required, covering all normal and edge cases explicitly or implicitly;
- Avoids any ambiguity, omissions, or contradictions that would leave uncertain implementation details;
- Expresses termination conditions and return values unequivocally.

If the pseudocode meets these rigorous standards, output **1**, indicating it is reproducible (i.e., guaranteed to pass all unit tests once implemented exactly as described). Otherwise, output **0**â€”if it is incomplete, logically incorrect, ambiguous, inconsistent, or missing critical details that prevent correct, test-passing implementation.

**Output only the single digit 1 or 0, nothing else.**
