Given a pseudocode describing an algorithm, determine if it is fully reproducible with zero ambiguity or logical defect—meaning that:

- It explicitly and unambiguously specifies all necessary steps, data structures, and operations,
- Input parameters, outputs, and all intermediate variables are clearly defined,
- Control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion) are correctly formed and comprehensive,
- All corner cases and boundary conditions are addressed or inherently handled,
- Indexing, iteration ranges, and data accesses have no off-by-one or out-of-bounds issues,
- No logical contradictions, omissions, or unexplained assumptions are present,
- The pseudocode can be translated directly by a competent programmer into correct, test-passing executable code without needing extra clarifications or fixes.

Do **not** consider domain-specific correctness—focus solely on algorithmic completeness, clarity, and soundness in terms of logic and stepwise procedure.

Output only:

- **1** if the pseudocode satisfies the above criteria and is thereby reproducible to pass all unit tests,  
- **0** otherwise.

**Do not output anything else besides this single digit (1 or 0).**
