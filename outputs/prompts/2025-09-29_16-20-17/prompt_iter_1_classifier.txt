Given the input pseudocode, determine if it provides a clear, unambiguous, and complete set of instructions that would enable it to pass all relevant unit tests for any general problem context. Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (i.e., fully sufficient to produce correct and testable code), or **0** otherwise. Do not output anything else.
