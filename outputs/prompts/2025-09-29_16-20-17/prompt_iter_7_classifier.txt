Given an arbitrary pseudocode input, determine whether it specifies a fully detailed, logically sound, and unambiguous algorithm that—without adding or assuming any external information—can be directly translated into correct, executable code passing **all** relevant unit tests for its intended functionality, regardless of problem domain.

To decide this, carefully verify that the pseudocode:

- Clearly and explicitly defines all inputs and outputs.
- Contains complete and correct handling of control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) with proper initialization and termination conditions.
- Includes all necessary data manipulations and state updates without omission or contradiction.
- Handles edge cases, boundary conditions, and error-prone scenarios explicitly or implicitly by logical completeness.
- Avoids ambiguity, vague instructions, or unresolved references and indexing errors.
- Does not contain logical flaws, infinite loops, missing returns, or inconsistent flow.
- Provides a step-by-step procedure sufficient for a competent programmer to implement a solution that passes every test case derived from the described task.

**Output exactly one digit:**

- Output **1** if the pseudocode meets all these criteria and is reproducible (i.e., guaranteed to pass all unit tests).
- Output **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, logically incorrect, or otherwise insufficient to guarantee passing all unit tests.

**Do not output anything other than 1 or 0.**
