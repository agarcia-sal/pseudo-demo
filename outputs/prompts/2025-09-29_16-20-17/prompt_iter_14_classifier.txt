Given an arbitrary pseudocode defining an algorithm, determine if it is fully detailed, unambiguous, and logically sound such that a competent programmer could implement it exactly to produce correct, test-passing code for **all** specified requirements and edge cases without needing further assumptions or clarifications. Your evaluation must verify:

- Complete and explicit input processing consistent with the problemâ€™s domain.
- Clear, well-structured control flow (including proper use of loops, conditionals, and recursion if applicable) with no infinite loops or unreachable code.
- Proper data handling and manipulation reflecting all necessary operations.
- Thorough coverage of all relevant edge cases (including empty inputs, boundary values, and special scenarios implied by common problem patterns).
- Precise, consistent indexing and boundary management without off-by-one or range errors.
- Absence of logical gaps, contradictions, or ambiguities in the step-by-step procedure.
- No reliance on undefined behavior or external context beyond what the pseudocode provides.

If the pseudocode meets **all** these criteria and can be directly translated into code that would pass every corresponding unit test, output **1**. Otherwise, output **0**.

**Output only a single digit: 1 or 0, and nothing else.**
