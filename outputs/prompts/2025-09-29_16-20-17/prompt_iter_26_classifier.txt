Evaluate the given pseudocode and determine if it fully and unambiguously specifies a logically sound algorithm that can be directly implemented to pass **all** possible unit tests for its intended functionality. Your assessment must ensure that:

- All inputs are clearly defined and correctly handled.
- The control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion) is explicit and free of infinite loops or premature terminations.
- All core operations and data manipulations are fully described without missing or ambiguous steps.
- Edge cases and boundary conditions are either clearly addressed or can be confidently inferred without contradictions.
- There are no indexing errors, type mismatches, or logical inconsistencies that would prevent a correct implementation.
- The pseudocode supports deterministic reproduction of valid outputs in all cases described by the problem statement.

If the pseudocode meets **every** one of these criteria so that a competent programmer could implement it as correct, complete, and passing all relevant unit tests without additional assumptions, output **1**. Otherwise, output **0**.

**Output only a single digit: 1 or 0.**
