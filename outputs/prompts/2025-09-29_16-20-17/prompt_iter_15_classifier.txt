Given an arbitrary pseudocode, determine whether it defines a fully explicit, unambiguous, and logically sound algorithm that a competent programmer can directly implement to produce code that passes all relevant unit tests for the specified functionality, across all valid inputs and edge cases, regardless of domain or context.

To evaluate this, confirm that the pseudocode:

- Clearly specifies all inputs and expected outputs.
- Includes complete and well-structured control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion where applicable) without indexing or boundary errors.
- Handles all necessary data manipulations precisely, including initialization, updates, and termination conditions.
- Accounts for edge cases and exceptional scenarios explicitly or implicitly through logic.
- Avoids ambiguity, omissions, logical contradictions, or inconsistencies.
- Provides step-by-step instructions sufficient to implement the functionality without guesswork or external assumptions.

If all these criteria are met so that the pseudocode is effectively a fully reproducible algorithm that will pass **all** unit tests, output:

**1**

Otherwise, if any of the above is missing, unclear, logically flawed, or incomplete such that the implementation would fail some tests, output:

**0**

**Output ONLY the single digit 1 or 0 and nothing else.**
