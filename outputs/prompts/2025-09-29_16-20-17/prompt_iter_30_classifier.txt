Given any pseudocode input, determine whether it specifies a fully detailed, logically sound, and unambiguous algorithm that a competent programmer could implement exactly as described to produce a working solution that passes **all** unit tests for the intended problem—irrespective of the problem domain or context.

To conclude this, rigorously verify that the pseudocode:

- Explicitly and correctly defines inputs, outputs, and all intermediate variables.
- Uses well-formed control structures with clearly defined loop boundaries and termination conditions.
- Provides complete, step-by-step procedural logic without gaps, contradictions, or ambiguous instructions.
- Correctly handles all typical and edge cases, avoiding indexing or boundary errors, infinite loops, or unreachable code.
- Avoids syntax or semantic ambiguities that would prevent direct translation into fully functioning, test-passing code.
- Reflects accurate data manipulation, clear variable initialization and updates, and consistent flow that can be consistently traced and executed.

Output **1** if, by these criteria, the pseudocode ensures guaranteed reproducibility—that is, the resulting implementation will pass all relevant unit tests. Output **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, logically incorrect, or missing critical details making it impossible to guarantee passing all unit tests.

**Your output must be strictly a single digit: 1 or 0, with no additional text, explanation, or formatting.**
