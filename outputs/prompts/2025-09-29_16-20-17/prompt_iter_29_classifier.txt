Evaluate the given pseudocode to determine if it fully specifies a deterministic, unambiguous algorithm that a proficient programmer could implement exactly as described to produce correct outputs passing **all** unit tests for its intended functionality, in any domain or context.

To conclude **1** (reproducible), the pseudocode must meet every criterion below:  
- Explicitly define all input parameters and their expected form  
- Contain complete, syntactically and logically coherent control flow (conditionals, loops, recursion) with no unreachable or infinite code paths  
- Manipulate data in a clear and correct manner without indexing errors, off-by-one mistakes, or improper state updates  
- Include handling of edge cases and boundary inputs, or provide instructions that guarantee correctness for all valid inputs  
- Avoid ambiguity and vagueness in procedural steps, ensuring no missing details or open-ended instructions  
- Use consistent, well-formed variable handling and initialization so the algorithmâ€™s progress and termination conditions are clear and valid  

If **any** of these aspects are incomplete, logically flawed, ambiguous, or insufficient to guarantee a correct, fully test-passing implementation, output **0**.

**Your output must be exactly one character: either 1 or 0, nothing else.**
