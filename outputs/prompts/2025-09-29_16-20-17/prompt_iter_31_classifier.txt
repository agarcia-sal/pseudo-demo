Evaluate the given pseudocode on the following criteria, to determine if it fully and unambiguously defines a complete and deterministically correct algorithm that a competent programmer could implement to pass **all** unit tests covering normal cases, edge cases, and error cases for the described functionality, regardless of domain:

- The pseudocode must clearly specify inputs and outputs with no ambiguity.
- Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) must be logically coherent, finite where appropriate, and cover all necessary cases including boundary/empty inputs.
- All operations and data manipulations must be explicit and well-defined, without indexing errors, off-by-one mistakes, or missing steps.
- The flow of logic must be complete with no critical omissions, vague instructions, or unresolved references.
- The algorithm must handle all relevant edge cases and exceptions inherently or explicitly.
- There must be no contradictions or logical flaws that would prevent correct implementation.
- Variable initializations and updates must be clearly described and consistent with intended behavior.
- Any helper functions or subprocedures called must themselves be defined or clearly defined in situ.

If and only if the pseudocode meets all these conditions so that it can be translated directly into a fully correct, compilable, and test-passing implementation without requiring external assumptions or guesses, output **1**.

Otherwise, output **0**.

**Output strictly one character, either 1 or 0, with no explanations or additional text.**
