Evaluate the given pseudocode to determine if it specifies a **fully detailed, unambiguous, and logically sound algorithm** that a skilled programmer could directly translate into a working program passing **all relevant unit tests** in its problem domain, without requiring assumptions or external clarifications.

Assess the pseudocode on these essential qualities:

1. **Completeness**: Every input, output, and intermediate step is explicitly described; no critical operations or conditions are omitted.
2. **Correctness**: Logical operations, control flow, and computations correctly implement the intended functionality, including proper handling of edge and corner cases.
3. **Clarity**: The algorithm’s procedure is unambiguous and sufficiently stepwise, avoiding contradictions, undefined variables, or unclear indexing.
4. **Determinism**: The pseudocode leads to a unique and reproducible result for all valid inputs, without reliance on unspecified behavior or side effects.
5. **Terminability**: Loops, recursions, and iterations have clear and well-defined termination conditions that prevent infinite execution.
6. **Conformity to specification**: The pseudocode fully addresses the problem’s requirements as typically tested by unit tests (e.g., correct outputs, error handling).

**Output exactly one digit:**

- Output **1** if the pseudocode meets all these criteria and is reproducible—meaning it can be implemented into code that passes every unit test related to the described functionality.
- Output **0** if it is incomplete, ambiguous, logically incorrect, or missing key details that prevent direct successful implementation and full unit test passing.

**Do not output anything other than this single digit (1 or 0).**
