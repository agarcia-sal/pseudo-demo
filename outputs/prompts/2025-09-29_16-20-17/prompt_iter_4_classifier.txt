Given an arbitrary pseudocode input, evaluate whether it defines a fully explicit, logically correct, and complete algorithm that can be directly implemented to pass **all** relevant unit tests for the described functionality—regardless of domain or context. To decide this, verify that the pseudocode includes all necessary components such as correct input handling, clear control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion if any), proper data manipulation, edge case coverage, and unambiguous step-by-step procedures without logical errors, omissions, or indexing flaws.

Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible—that is, if a competent programmer could write fully correct, test-passing code based solely on the given instructions. Output **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, logically flawed, or missing critical details that would prevent it from passing all unit tests.

**Do not output anything other than this single digit (1 or 0).**
