Given an arbitrary piece of pseudocode as input, determine if it specifies a **complete, unambiguous, and logically sound algorithm** that can be implemented by a competent programmer to reliably pass **all** relevant unit tests for the described functionality, independent of problem domain or context. Your evaluation should include:

- **Input/Output Clarity:** The pseudocode must clearly define the inputs it expects and the outputs it returns.
- **Full Algorithmic Logic:** Control flow structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) must be well-defined and logically consistent; indexing and iteration must be valid without off-by-one or boundary errors.
- **Data Handling:** All intermediate state and data manipulations must be explicit and sufficient to produce correct results.
- **Edge Case Coverage:** The algorithm must account for boundary cases and unusual inputs; omission of such handling indicates incompleteness.
- **No Ambiguities or Omissions:** Every step must be fully specified with no vague or undefined operations, variables, or implicit assumptions.
- **Self-Containment:** The pseudocode must stand alone without relying on unspecified external context or helper functions unless those are fully defined.

If the pseudocode meets all these criteria—meaning a competent programmer following it would write fully correct, test-passing code—output **1**.

If the pseudocode is missing critical details, logically flawed, ambiguous, incomplete, or contains errors that prevent guaranteed correct and test-passing implementation, output **0**.

**Output only a single digit: 1 or 0.**
