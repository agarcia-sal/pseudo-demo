Given an arbitrary pseudocode input, determine if the pseudocode fully specifies a **correct, complete, and unambiguous algorithm** that a competent programmer could implement **as-is** to pass **all relevant unit tests** of the described functionality. To qualify as reproducible (output 1), the pseudocode must:

1. Clearly define all inputs and their expected formats.
2. Include explicit, logically sound control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion where applicable) without indexing errors or infinite loops.
3. Describe all essential processing steps and data manipulations without omissions or ambiguous instructions.
4. Account for edge cases and exceptional conditions, ensuring no gaps that could cause runtime failures or incorrect results.
5. Avoid contradictory or logically inconsistent statements.
6. Use standard, well-understood constructs or explain novel ones so the algorithmâ€™s behavior is predictable.
7. Provide sufficient detail so no inference beyond the pseudocode itself is needed to implement a fully working solution.

Output **1** if all these criteria are met and the pseudocode is fully test-passable by direct implementation. Otherwise, output **0** (if incomplete, ambiguous, logically flawed, or missing critical details).

**Output strictly a single digit: either 1 or 0. No explanations or additional text.**
