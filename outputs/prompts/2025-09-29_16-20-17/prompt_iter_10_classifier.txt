Given an arbitrary pseudocode input describing an algorithm, determine if the pseudocode is fully explicit, logically sound, and sufficiently detailed to enable a competent programmer to implement a working solution that will pass **all** unit tests relevant to its described functionalityâ€”across any domain or problem context.

To decide this, rigorously evaluate that the pseudocode:

- Provides complete and unambiguous input specifications.
- Clearly defines all data structures, variables, and initializations.
- Exhibits precise and correct control flow, including iteration, conditionals, and recursion where applicable.
- Handles all edge cases, boundary conditions, and possible input variations explicitly or implicitly.
- Employs valid and consistent data manipulation without logical contradictions, indexing errors, or overlooked cases.
- Specifies termination conditions, return values, and output format unambiguously.
- Avoids syntactic ambiguities and implicit assumptions that could lead to implementation errors or failed tests.

Output **1** if, based on these criteria, the pseudocode constitutes a fully reproducible algorithm guaranteed to pass all relevant unit tests when implemented. Output **0** if it lacks completeness, clarity, logical correctness, or contains flaws that would prevent it from producing a correct, test-passing implementation.

**Strictly output a single digit (1 or 0) and nothing else.**
