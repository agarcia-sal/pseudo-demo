Evaluate the given pseudocode and determine if it specifies a fully defined, logically consistent, and unambiguous algorithm that, when implemented by a skilled programmer, would pass **all** unit tests for the intended functionality without any modification or additional assumptions. Consider these criteria thoroughly:

- Completeness: All inputs, internal states, and outputs are clearly identified and properly handled.
- Correctness: The logic (including loops, conditionals, recursion, data manipulation) is sound, with no contradictions, infinite loops, off-by-one errors, or incorrect calculations.
- Explicitness: Every necessary step is concretely described; there are no vague instructions, missing operations, or implicit assumptions.
- Coverage: Edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios are accounted for or can be reliably inferred.
- Consistency: Variables, data structures, and flow control are used coherently throughout the pseudocode.
- Implementability: The pseudocode can be straightforwardly translated into runnable code without guesswork or error-prone interpretation.

Output **1** if the pseudocode meets all these criteria and thus is reproducibleâ€”meaning it is sufficient and precise enough to pass all relevant unit tests. Output **0** if it lacks clarity, completeness, logical soundness, or necessary detail that would prevent it from passing all unit tests.

**Output exactly one character: either 1 or 0. Nothing else.**
