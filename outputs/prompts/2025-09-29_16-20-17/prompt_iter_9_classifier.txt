Evaluate the given pseudocode to determine whether it specifies a complete, unambiguous, and logically correct algorithm that, if implemented exactly as described, will pass **all** relevant unit tests for the intended functionality, without requiring any external assumptions or additional information.

To do so, check for:

- Explicit input and output definitions consistent with the described task.
- Clear, well-structured control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion, etc.) covering all normal and edge cases.
- Precise and correct data operations without indexing errors, off-by-one mistakes, or logical flaws.
- Handling of edge conditions, empty inputs, and boundary values as needed.
- Absence of ambiguity or missing steps that would prevent direct, error-free implementation.
- Logical consistency throughout the algorithm ensuring it meets the specified requirements.

If the pseudocode meets **all** these criteria and a competent programmer could produce fully functional, test-passing code solely based on it, output **1**. Otherwise, output **0**.

**Output only a single digit: 1 or 0. No explanation or additional text.**
