Given an arbitrary pseudocode input describing an algorithm, determine if it meets the strict criteria for reproducibility: it must be fully detailed, logically sound, and unambiguously complete to the extent that a proficient programmer can translate it directly into working code that passes **all** associated unit tests without any additional interpretation, assumptions, or supplementary information.

Evaluate the pseudocode based on these rigorously defined facets:
- **Completeness:** All required steps to fulfill the intended functionality are present, including input validation, boundary/edge cases, and output generation.
- **Clarity and Precision:** Each instruction is unambiguous and explicitly outlined without implicit assumptions or missing details.
- **Correctness of Logic:** Control structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) are well-formed and logically consistent; no off-by-one errors, infinite loops, or unreachable code.
- **Data Handling:** Proper and clear manipulation of data structures, indexing, and variable initialization occur without errors or contradictions.
- **Edge Case Coverage:** The handling of special cases, such as empty inputs, minimum or maximum values, and invalid inputs, must be explicit or deterministically handled.
- **No Syntactic or Semantic Flaws:** The pseudocode should not contain contradictions, undefined variables, or invalid operations that would prevent correct implementation.

If the pseudocode fulfills all these criteria, output **1**.

If it contains any ambiguity, incompleteness, logical flaw, or omission that would prevent a direct and fully correct implementation passing every relevant unit test, output **0**.

**IMPORTANT:** Output only a single digit — **1** or **0** — and nothing else. No explanations, justifications, or additional text.
