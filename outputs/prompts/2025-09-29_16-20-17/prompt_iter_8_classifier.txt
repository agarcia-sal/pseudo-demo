Given an arbitrary piece of pseudocode, determine if it fully and explicitly specifies a reproducible algorithm that can be directly implemented by a competent programmer to **pass all unit tests** for the intended functionality without additional assumptions, external clarifications, or changes.

To do so, systematically check that the pseudocode:

- Clearly defines all inputs, outputs, and intermediate variables.
- Uses unambiguous, complete, and logically sound control flow structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) covering all relevant iterations and branches.
- Includes all essential operations on data structures, handles indexing correctly, and manipulates data consistently.
- Accounts for all edge cases and exceptional conditions relevant to the problem.
- Is free from logical flaws, inconsistencies, ambiguities, or omissions that would cause implementation errors or test failures.
- Provides step-by-step procedural clarity ensuring that no critical detail is left underspecified or implicit.

If the pseudocode meets all these criteria so that it can be implemented exactly as described and pass all unit tests, output:

**1**

Otherwise, output:

**0**

**Output strictly and only a single digit: 1 or 0. No explanations or other text.**
