Given the input pseudocode of an arbitrary algorithm, determine if it is fully explicit, complete, and logically correct to the extent that a competent programmer, relying solely on this pseudocode, can implement a working solution that will pass **every relevant unit test** for its intended functionality without any ambiguity or omission.

To make this determination, carefully and systematically verify the following criteria:

1. **Inputs and outputs**: The pseudocode explicitly specifies inputs and the expected output format or values.
2. **Control flow and termination**: All loops, recursion, and conditional branches are well-defined with clear exit conditions. There are no infinite loops, unreachable code, or undefined jumps.
3. **Data handling and manipulation**: All data structures and variables are properly initialized, updated, and used consistently. Indexing and boundary conditions are handled correctly.
4. **Logical correctness**: The algorithmâ€™s core logic correctly implements the intended computation or transformation, covering normal cases and all relevant edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, single-element lists, maximum/minimum values).
5. **Completeness without ambiguity**: No critical steps, definitions, or instructions are omitted. The pseudocode avoids vague or contradictory statements that prevent direct implementation.

If, and **only if**, every above aspect is satisfied such that the pseudocode alone suffices to write fully correct, test-passing code for the described function, output exactly:

`1`

Otherwise, if any ambiguity, incompleteness, logical error, or omission exists that would cause failure on one or more unit tests, output exactly:

`0`

**Do not write anything other than the single digit (1 or 0).**
