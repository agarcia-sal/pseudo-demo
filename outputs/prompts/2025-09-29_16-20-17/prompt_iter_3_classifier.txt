Given the input pseudocode, thoroughly evaluate whether it specifies a precise, logically consistent, and fully defined algorithm that can be directly translated into executable code passing **all** unit tests for any valid general input scenario. Your assessment must account for completeness (all necessary steps and edge cases covered), clarity (no ambiguous or contradictory instructions), correctness (the logic correctly solves the intended problem), and implementability (no syntactic or semantic errors, infinite loops without termination, or undefined behaviors). Output **1** if the pseudocode is confidently reproducible and guarantees passing all unit tests; otherwise, output **0**. Do not output anything else.
