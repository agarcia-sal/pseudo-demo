Given the input pseudocode, rigorously evaluate whether it is **unambiguously complete**, **logically consistent**, and **sufficiently detailed** to implement a fully correct solution that will pass **all relevant unit tests** for any typical, well-defined problem scenario. Consider correctness of control flow, proper initialization and updates of variables, correct handling of edge cases, absence of logical or indexing errors, and clarity of all steps. 

Output **1** if the pseudocode can be confidently reproduced into correct, test-passing code. Output **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, inconsistent, contains critical logical errors, or would fail any unit test due to such deficiencies.

**Output only the single digit 0 or 1, without any additional text or explanation.**
