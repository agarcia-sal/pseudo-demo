Evaluate the given pseudocode for whether it fully and unambiguously defines a complete, logically sound, and implementable algorithm that a competent programmer can translate into working code which passes **all** relevant unit tests for the specified problemâ€”no matter the domain or context.

Specifically, check that the pseudocode:

- Explicitly and correctly handles all inputs and expected outputs.
- Contains clearly defined and correct control flow: loops, conditionals, and recursion must terminate properly and handle base and edge cases.
- Covers all edge cases and boundary conditions, without gaps or implicit assumptions.
- Uses well-defined, consistent operations on data structures without indexing errors or ambiguous data manipulation.
- Has no logical contradictions, omissions, or unclear steps that prevent complete implementation.
- Provides a deterministic step-by-step procedure detailed enough to reproduce the intended behavior exactly.

Output **1** only if the pseudocode meets all these criteria and would guarantee passing every unit test for the described functionality. Output **0** otherwise.

**Output strictly one digit: either 1 or 0, with no explanation, formatting, or extra text.**
