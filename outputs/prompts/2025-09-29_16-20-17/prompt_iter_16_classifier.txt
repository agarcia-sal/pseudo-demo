Given an arbitrary pseudocode input, determine with **absolute certainty** whether it defines a fully explicit, unambiguous, logically consistent, and comprehensive algorithm that a competent programmer could implement *as-is* to pass **all** relevant unit tests for the described functionality, across any domain or context.

To decide, systematically verify that the pseudocode:

- Clearly specifies all inputs and outputs without omissions or ambiguity
- Includes all necessary initialization steps and variable declarations
- Defines precise and well-structured control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion, or iterative processes) that terminate correctly
- Manipulates data explicitly and correctly, without logical contradictions or undefined operations
- Accounts for all edge cases and boundary conditions inherent in the problem space
- Avoids indexing errors, off-by-one mistakes, infinite loops, or unreachable code
- Contains no internal inconsistencies or implicit assumptions needing external clarification
- Provides a fully traceable step-by-step procedure that leads unequivocally from inputs to correct outputs 

Output **1** if—and only if—the pseudocode meets every one of these criteria and thus guarantees reproducible, test-passing behavior for the intended functionality.

Output **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, logically flawed, misses critical details, or would otherwise prevent direct implementation from passing **all** unit tests.

**Do not output any explanations, comments, or anything other than a single digit (1 or 0).**
