Given an arbitrary pseudocode input, rigorously evaluate whether it defines a **complete, unambiguous, and logically sound** algorithm that can be implemented directly to pass **all** relevant unit tests for the described task, across any domain or context. In your assessment, ensure:

- The pseudocode specifies all necessary inputs and clearly defines outputs.
- All control structures (loops, recursion, conditionals) have well-defined, reachable exit conditions.
- Data handling and state mutations are explicitly detailed without contradictions or undefined behavior.
- The algorithm addresses all edge cases and boundary conditions inherently or explicitly.
- There are no logical flaws such as off-by-one errors, indexing mistakes, infinite loops, or missing critical computations.
- Step-by-step instructions are precise, deterministic, and sufficiently detailed for a skilled programmer to implement a fully functionally equivalent solution that **passes every unit test** related to the functionality described.
- Any helper or nested functions are fully defined and integrated correctly.
- The pseudocode avoids ambiguity or assumptions about unstated behaviors or environmental factors.

Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets all the above criteria and is fully reproducible as per the definitionâ€”meaning it can produce correct, test-passing code without any modifications or clarifications. Output **0** otherwise.

**Strictly output only a single digit (1 or 0) with no additional text or formatting.**
