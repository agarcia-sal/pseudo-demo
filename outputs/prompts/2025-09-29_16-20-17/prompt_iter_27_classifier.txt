Given a block of pseudocode describing an algorithm, determine whether it is fully explicit, logically sound, and complete in every respect such that a competent programmer can translate it directly into working code that will pass **all** relevant unit tests for the intended functionality—irrespective of problem domain or context.

To make this judgment, verify these critical criteria:

- **Inputs and outputs:** Clearly specified, with all necessary parameter handling and return values defined.
- **Correctness:** Logical flow is error-free, with no contradictions, off-by-one mistakes, or indexing errors.
- **Completeness:** All necessary algorithmic steps are present, including initialization, processing, updating of variables, and final returns.
- **Control flow:** Loops, conditionals, and recursion (if present) are correctly structured and converge or terminate appropriately.
- **Edge cases:** Explicitly or implicitly handled (e.g., empty input, minimal/maximal values).
- **Unambiguity:** No vague or undefined operations; every step is clearly defined and executable.
- **Data manipulation:** Operations on data structures and variables are precise and consistent with the algorithm’s objective.

If the pseudocode fully satisfies these conditions so that it legitimately can be implemented into code passing all tests without guesswork or modification, output **1**.

If there is any incompleteness, logical flaw, ambiguity, missing detail, or structural error that would prevent a correct, test-passing implementation, output **0**.

**Important:** Output strictly one digit — either **1** or **0** — and nothing else.
