Given an input pseudocode, analyze **all** its logic, control flows, variable definitions, and operations to decide if the pseudocode is fully self-contained, deterministic, and detailed enough to pass **every unit test without error**. Consider whether it unambiguously specifies all necessary algorithmic steps, edge case handling, and data structures so that it can be implemented and yield correct results in every scenario covered by unit tests.

Output **a single digit:**  
**1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (able to pass all unit tests),  
or **0** if it is not reproducible.

Do **not** output anything else, no explanations, no whitespace, no formatting.  
The output digits correspond, in order, exactly to the order in which pseudocodes are provided.
