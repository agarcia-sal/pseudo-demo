Given a pseudocode input, critically and exhaustively determine its reproducibility by applying the exact criteria below with no exceptions or assumptions:  

1. **Complete Definitions**: Confirm every variable, data structure, constant, function, and external dependency is explicitly declared, initialized, or defined within the pseudocode itself, leaving no undeclared or ambiguous elements.  

2. **Explicit and Fully Specified Logic**: Verify that all algorithmic steps are detailed and unambiguous—including initialization, all control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion), update rules, branching criteria, and precise termination conditions—ensuring no gaps or implied knowledge.  

3. **Comprehensive Input Coverage**: Ensure the pseudocode explicitly addresses every valid input domain aspect, including all edge cases, boundary conditions, and potential corner scenarios affecting correctness.  

4. **Deterministic and Self-contained Behavior**: Check that the control and data flows are logically coherent, free from contradictions or hidden side effects, and avoid reliance on any external context, execution environment, or unstated assumptions beyond the given pseudocode.  

5. **Implementation-readiness to Pass All Unit Tests**: Confirm the pseudocode, as written, can be directly translated into a working implementation that will deterministically and correctly pass all conceivable unit tests relevant to the described problem specification, with no omitted steps, subtle bugs, or ambiguities that would cause failure or require guesswork.  

6. **No Semantic or Syntactic Ambiguity**: Ascertain there are no vague operators, inconsistent indexing, unspecified data ordering, or conflicting instructions that would prevent faithful reproduction or correct implementation.  

Output exactly one digit per pseudocode input:  
- Output **1** if and only if all the above criteria are perfectly met, indicating the pseudocode is reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests.  
- Output **0** otherwise.  

No additional characters, whitespace, explanation, or formatting are permitted.  
The order of output digits must strictly follow the order of the respective pseudocode inputs.
