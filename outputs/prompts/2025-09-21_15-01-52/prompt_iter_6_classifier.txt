Given an input pseudocode, rigorously analyze it for *complete and precise* reproducibility by verifying all of the following criteria without exception:  
- Every variable, data structure, constant, and function used is explicitly and unambiguously defined or initialized within the pseudocode.  
- The full algorithmic logic is clearly and entirely specified, including initialization steps, iterative or recursive updates, branching conditions, loop invariants, and exact termination criteria.  
- The pseudocode explicitly and completely accounts for all possible input scenarios and edge cases relevant to the problem domain, enabling deterministic behavior under any valid input.  
- Control flow and data flow are logically consistent and free of contradictions, ambiguities, hidden assumptions, or dependencies on external information not included in the pseudocode.  
- All necessary computations and transformations are fully detailed to guarantee that the pseudocode can be *implemented as is* and will correctly *pass every conceivable unit test* for the described problem.  
If and only if every one of these stringent conditions is met, output 1; otherwise, output 0.  

The output must contain exactly one digit (1 or 0) per pseudocode input, corresponding precisely to the order of inputs provided. Output no additional characters, explanation, whitespace, or formatting.
