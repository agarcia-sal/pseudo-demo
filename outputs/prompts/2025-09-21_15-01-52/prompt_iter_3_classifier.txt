Given an input pseudocode, perform an in-depth evaluation of its completeness, clarity, and correctness focused on reproducibilityâ€”specifically whether it defines *all* variables, data structures, and functions unambiguously; specifies every essential algorithmic step, including initialization, updates, and termination conditions; clearly handles all relevant edge cases and input scenarios; and ensures deterministic, consistent behavior without requiring external or implicit knowledge. Assess the control flow for logical soundness, absence of contradictions or ambiguities, and sufficiency to implement and pass **every unit test without fail**. Any missing detail, ambiguity, or dependence on unstated assumptions renders it non-reproducible.

Output exactly one digit per pseudocode input:  
**1** if the pseudocode is reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests,  
or **0** if it is not reproducible.

Produce no other text, no explanations, whitespace, or formatting.  
The sequence of output digits must correspond exactly to the order of the pseudocodes provided as input.
