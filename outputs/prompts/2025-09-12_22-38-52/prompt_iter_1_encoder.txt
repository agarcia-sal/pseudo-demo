Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly natural language, symbolic operators, and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Avoid purpose statements, summaries, overviews, comments, or explanations—provide only the pseudocode. Follow a numbered step format with one-liners and simple constructs, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity within a 5-second generation time limit.
