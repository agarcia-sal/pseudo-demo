Translate the provided pseudocode into a complete, fully functional, idiomatic, and efficient Python implementation, strictly adhering to the following rules:

- Keep all class names, method/function names, signatures, and their parameter names exactly as they appear in the pseudocode, preserving all object-oriented structures and hierarchies.
- Enclose the entire output **only** within a single Python code block using triple backticks with the Python language tag:
  ```python
  ...
  ```
- Explicitly import **all** standard Python modules and packages needed for your implementation at the top of the code block (e.g., collections, typing, heapq, math, itertools, etc.).
- For all inputs that represent complex data structures (e.g., binary trees, linked lists, graphs) passed as primitive Python lists or arrays, generate robust, self-contained conversion helpers (e.g., static factory methods or classmethods inside corresponding classes) that:
  - Convert these list/array inputs into proper object-oriented structures.
  - Handle edge cases such as empty lists, `None`, `null`, or missing elements gracefully.
  - Replace any `null` placeholders with Python `None` safely, and ensure no unresolved names like `null` remain.
  - Ensure that within solution methods, inputs are fully converted objects (never raw lists).
- Provide all required supporting classes, helper functions, and methods inside the same code block â€” include constructors, tree builders, linked list builders, or any utility needed.
- Use appropriate Python typing annotations from the `typing` module everywhere relevant, including for class members, method parameters, and return types.
- Map pseudocode data types and nullability into their Python equivalents correctly; interpret `null` or empty values precisely as `None`.
- Follow Python best practices to write clean, readable code that is both pythonic and efficient, aiming at a runtime well within 5 seconds.
- The final code must be runnable as-is without requiring modification or wrapping.
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, debug prints, or any text outside the single code block.
- Do NOT output anything except this one Python code block.

Here is the pseudocode to be translated:
