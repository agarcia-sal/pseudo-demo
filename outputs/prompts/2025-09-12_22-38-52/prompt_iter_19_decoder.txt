Translate the provided pseudocode into complete, fully functional, clean, idiomatic, and efficient Python code that strictly preserves all class names, function names, method names, signatures, and object-oriented structures exactly as given. Your code must satisfy the following enhanced requirements:

- Enclose the entire output exclusively within a single Python code block annotated as ```python ... ```.
- Include explicit and necessary imports at the very top of the code block (standard library or well-known packages like `collections`, `heapq`, `typing`, `math`, etc.) required for your solution; do not omit imports.
- Implement *every* detail indicated in the pseudocode thoroughly and preciselyâ€”no partial or omitted functionality.
- Maintain *exactly* the same function and method names, parameter names, parameter order, and any type hints as implied or explicit in the pseudocode.
- Handle all input conversion cleanly and robustly:
  - When inputs represent complex data structures (e.g., binary trees, linked lists, graphs) as primitive Python types like lists or arrays, provide comprehensive, safe, and reusable factory/conversion helper methods inside the same class or as static/class methods. These helpers must translate raw inputs into the appropriate data structure instances.
  - These helpers *must* correctly parse and handle all edge cases (empty inputs, `None`/`null` values, incomplete data, empty lists, etc.).
  - Ensure that the main solution methods **never** assume raw inputs (like lists) but always operate on the actual converted objects.
- Convert pseudocode type annotations and nullability notions (`None`, `null`) into Pythonic equivalents, using precise type annotations from `typing` (`Optional`, `List`, `Dict`, `Deque`, etc.) wherever appropriate.
- Replace any pseudocode-specific literals such as `null` with correct Python `None`, and ensure input parsing respects this semantics.
- Implement all necessary helper classes and methods (e.g., `TreeNode`, `ListNode`) with fully defined constructors, representation methods (optional), and any utility methods required for conversion and traversal within the solution code block.
- The solution code must be pythonic, clear, concise, maintainable, optimized for runtime efficiency (complete within 5 seconds), and directly runnable without further modification.
- Do **not** include any debugging statements, print calls, comments, explanations, or any text outside the Python code block.
- Avoid any extra formatting, separators, or explanations; output only the executable Python code block that reflects the pseudocode logic perfectly.
