Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code that strictly preserves all class names, method names, and the object-oriented structure as defined in the pseudocode. The generated Python code must be enclosed entirely within a single Python code block using ```python ... ```. 

Ensure the following:  
1. Code correctness and completeness â€” do not omit parts of function or class implementations.  
2. Maintain the same function signatures and class structures as in the pseudocode.  
3. Use meaningful and consistent variable names as implied or stated by the pseudocode.  
4. Handle data types and inputs carefully, including proper handling of lists, None/null values, and imports if needed.  
5. Optimize the solution to run efficiently within a 5-second timeout without compromising clarity.  
6. Import and use any standard Python packages if necessary.  
7. Do not add any explanations, debug prints, or comments unless explicitly instructed in the pseudocode.  
8. Return only the code, nothing else.

Here is the pseudocode to be translated:
