Generate pseudocode that solves the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read, compact, and high-level, using concise statements, one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations where appropriate. Avoid providing purpose, summary, overview, comments, or explanations—output strictly the pseudocode instructions only. Follow this format using simple numbering and indentation:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for clarity and brevity, ensuring pseudocode can be understood without extra notes. Your solution must execute within 5 seconds and produce the best result possible within this constraint.
