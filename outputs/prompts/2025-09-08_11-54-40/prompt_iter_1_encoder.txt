Generate concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable, using natural language with one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode itself. Follow a numbered line format, for example:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Aim for compactness and clarity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; return the best possible results within this limit.
