Generate clear, concise, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description, emphasizing readability and compactness using natural language with symbolic notation and common abbreviations. Produce mostly one-line instructions unless multiple lines improve clarity. Use meaningful yet short variable names. Prefer simple control structures (loops, conditionals) in symbolic form. Represent inputs, outputs, declarations, and control flow succinctly without verbose explanations, comments, or summaries. Number lines starting at 1.

Format pseudocode like this:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Do not include separators or extra formatting. Output only the pseudocode—no additional text.
