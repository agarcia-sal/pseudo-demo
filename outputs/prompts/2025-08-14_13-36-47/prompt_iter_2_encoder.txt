Generate concise, clear, and easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use primarily natural language combined with symbolic notation and common abbreviations to keep pseudocode compact and high-level. Prefer one-line statements whenever possible without sacrificing clarity.

Instructions:
- Output only the pseudocode—no explanations, comments, summaries, or purposes.
- Do not include notes or descriptive text.
- Use meaningful variable names but keep them short and intuitive.
- Favor simple control structures (loops, conditionals) and operations in symbolic form.
- Use numbered lines starting at 1.
- Align with this format:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

- Represent input, output, declarations, and control flow clearly but succinctly.
- Avoid excessive verbosity; be natural and readable.
- Optimize for compactness and clarity to enable fast comprehension within a 5-second response time.
