Generate easy-to-read, concise pseudocode from the given problem description using natural language with compact, high-level expressions. Prioritize clarity and brevity by using mostly one-line statements, symbolic assignments (like ←, +=, -=), and common abbreviations without comments, explanations, summaries, or notes. Output only pseudocode in this exact format with numbered lines:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++

Favor simple constructs, direct control flow, and consistent variable naming. Avoid separator lines or extra formatting. The pseudocode should be self-contained and reflect an efficient, readable algorithm within a 5-second runtime limit.
