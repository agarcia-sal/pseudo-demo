Translate the provided pseudocode into clear, concise, and correct Python code that executes efficiently within 5 seconds. 

- Your code must run without additional input prompts; if input is required, use plain `input()` without any arguments.
- Include all necessary imports explicitly; optimize code using standard Python libraries if it improves clarity or performance.
- Do not add any extraneous explanations or separator lines before or after the code.
- Output only the complete Python code enclosed in a single code block formatted exactly as follows:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Focus on faithfully implementing all pseudocode logic, handle edge cases gracefully, and write idiomatic, readable Python that balances clarity and efficiency.
