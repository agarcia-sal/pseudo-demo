Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a semantically equivalent pseudocode version that preserves all original functionality exactly, including all class names, function names, their nesting, and object structures unchanged and in the original order. You must keep all function parameter names the same to maintain interface compatibility. Your rewritten pseudocode should differ maximally from the original code in *all other aspects*, creating the greatest possible syntactic, stylistic, and structural divergence without changing meaning or behavior.

Specifically, apply a wide variety of transformations, including but not limited to:

- Systematically rename all local variables, temporary variables, loop counters, and internal identifiers with completely different, non-overlapping names that do not shadow parameters or global names.
- Alter control flow constructs where possible by converting loops to recursion and recursion to loops, or switching between different loop types (for, while, repeat-until) with equivalent logic.
- Reorganize code blocks by reordering statements that do not affect dependencies or outcomes, and split or merge conditional branches into logically equivalent alternatives.
- Replace control structures with alternatives (e.g., convert if-else chains into switch-case or vice versa), transform boolean conditions using logical equivalences, and substitute ternary operations for if-else or vice versa.
- Change the use of data structures to equivalent ones (arrays ↔ lists, maps ↔ dictionaries), and substitute operators with equivalent expressions (e.g., increment versus addition assignment).
- Vary syntax and formatting extensively, including indentation style, spacing, capitalization conventions, comment positioning (but do not add or remove comments), and line breaks.
- Inline simple expressions or extract complex expressions into named intermediate variables.
- Use different but functionally identical constructs for assignments, returns, and expressions.
- Avoid introducing any new comments, annotations, or explanations; do not remove or reorder existing comments.
- Your output must contain *only* the rewritten pseudocode — no explanations or other text.

Maintain strict functional equivalence, identical class and function interface signatures, and class/function nesting and ordering, but maximize all other forms of syntactic, stylistic, and structural difference to produce a pseudocode version that appears substantially different while behaving the same.
