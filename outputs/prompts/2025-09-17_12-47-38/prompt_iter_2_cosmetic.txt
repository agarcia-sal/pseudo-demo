Given an input pseudocode snippet, rewrite it to produce a semantically equivalent version that preserves all functionality exactly but differs maximally in all non-essential aspects: structure, control flow, variable naming (excluding function and class names), data structures used, statement order where possible, and formatting style. Keep the original function names, class names, and their hierarchical organization intactâ€”do not alter or reorder classes or functions. Your output must consist solely of the revised pseudocode with no explanations, comments, or annotations. Prioritize creative transformations such as replacing loops with recursion or different loop constructs, using alternative but logically equivalent operations, renaming local variables thoroughly, and varying syntax conventions, to maximize syntactic and stylistic divergence while ensuring correctness.
