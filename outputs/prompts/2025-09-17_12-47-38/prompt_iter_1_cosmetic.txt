Given the following pseudocode, rewrite it to produce a version that is as different as possible from the original in terms of structure, syntax, and style, while strictly preserving all original functionality. Maintain the exact same function names, class names, and class/object hierarchies as in the original code. Your output should contain only the transformed pseudocode with no additional explanation or commentary.
