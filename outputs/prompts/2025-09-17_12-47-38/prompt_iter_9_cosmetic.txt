Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce a fully transformed version of the pseudocode that is functionally and semantically identical—preserving all behavior, interfaces, and outputs exactly—but that differs as much as possible in syntax, structure, and style. The transformation must strictly retain:

- All original **class names**, their nesting, hierarchy, and order.
- All original **function names** and their exact **parameter names**, including order, without any modification or reordering.
- The presence, order, and exact text of all comments or annotations—no additions, removals, or edits allowed.
- Overall interface contracts must remain fully intact, including all signatures and return statements.

Within these constraints, rewrite the pseudocode to maximize divergence by applying *at least three* of the following *distinct* techniques wherever logically possible:

1. **Rename all local variables, loop counters, and temporary identifiers with entirely new consistent names that do not overlap with original identifiers**, maintaining logical correctness.
2. **Transform iterative logic into recursion and recursive logic into iteration**, wherever feasible.
3. **Replace control flow constructs by alternate logically equivalent patterns** — e.g., convert if-else to switch-case (or chained conditionals if switch unavailable), replace nested conditionals with guard clauses or early returns, reorder independent branches, or use conditional expressions (ternaries) in place of statements.
4. **Alter data representations or access styles** (for example, substitute arrays with linked lists, hash maps, sets, or tuples as appropriate without changing meaning), and replace direct access with destructuring/unpacking or explicit indexing interchangeably.
5. **Rearrange independent statements or reorder blocks that do not introduce data or control dependencies**, to vary flow and layout.
6. **Modify syntax for assignments, operators, and expressions** (change `=` to `<-` or `:=`, rewrite arithmetic with equivalent expressions, replace compound assignments with expanded forms, etc.).
7. **Change naming conventions internally** (e.g., snake_case ↔ camelCase ↔ PascalCase, or apply Hungarian notation) but only for local variables; class and function names remain unchanged.
8. **Vary formatting radically**—alter indentation style and depth, spacing, line breaks, and comment styles (block, line, inline) without adding or removing comments.
9. **Restructure code with equivalent code blocks in place of single statements or vice versa** (e.g., inline a function call or make it explicit; unroll simple loops partially if safe).

Strictly avoid:

- Changing or removing any class or function definitions or their order.
- Modifying function signatures, parameter names, or class hierarchies in any way.
- Adding, removing, or altering comments or annotations.
- Changing any returned values/output or behavior.

Output **only** the fully transformed pseudocode snippet with no additional explanation or text.

Focus on combining multiple transformations per functional block to produce maximal syntactic, semantic, and stylistic difference while guaranteed preserving all functionality and original class/function structure and interfaces exactly.
