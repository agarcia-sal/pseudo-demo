Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate an output pseudocode that is functionally identical, producing exactly the same behavior and outputs for all inputs, while strictly preserving:

- All class names, their exact nesting, and object-oriented structure as in the input.
- All function/method names and their parameters exactly as in the input, preserving their order and signatures.
- The overall order and hierarchy of classes and functions, without adding or removing any class/function or changing their placement.

Within these constraints, transform the pseudocode to maximize syntactic, stylistic, and structural divergence by applying *all* of the following techniques thoroughly and consistently:

1. **Rename every internal local variable and loop index to completely different names**, avoiding any similarity in spelling or length to the originals. Keep parameter names unchanged.

2. **Convert iterative control flows into recursive ones, and vice versa, wherever logically feasible.** For example, change for-loops to while-loops or recursion, and recursion to iteration.

3. **Replace all control structures with logically equivalent alternatives:** e.g., switch between if-else chains and switch/case constructs, change condition negation styles, or use early returns instead of nested conditionals.

4. **Reorder independent and commutative statements or expressions when possible without changing semantics.**

5. **Swap data structures with functionally equivalent alternatives:** e.g., replace arrays with linked lists or maps, replace dictionaries with arrays indexed differently, or vice versa.

6. **Change expression formulations and operations to equivalent ones:** e.g., replace arithmetic expressions with equivalent steps, use different built-in functions if equivalent, or rewrite conditions logically without altering outcomes.

7. **Alter syntax formatting extensively:** vary indentation levels, use different statement delimiters if applicable, change keyword capitalization styles (e.g., upper/lower/mixed case), and reorganize line breaks and spacing.

8. **Eliminate all comments, annotations, and explanationsâ€”output only the rewritten pseudocode.**

9. **Do not add or remove any functionality or comments, and do not change the interfaces exposed.**

The output must contain *only* the rewritten pseudocode, respecting the original functional interfaces and class/function structure but exhibiting maximal difference in all other syntactic and structural aspects to ensure minimal textual similarity with the original pseudocode.
