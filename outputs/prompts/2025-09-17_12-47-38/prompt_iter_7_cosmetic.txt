Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce a semantically equivalent pseudocode version that preserves all original functionality **completely**, strictly keeping all original function names, class names, and their nesting or object structures intact and in the exact same order. The output must consist **only** of the rewritten pseudocode, with no explanations, comments, or annotations added or removed.

Your rewritten pseudocode should maximize structural and syntactic divergence from the input while preserving exact behavior and interfaces. To achieve this, perform comprehensive and radical transformations including but not limited to:

- Thoroughly rename **all local variables and loop indices** with new, non-overlapping, semantically neutral names (e.g., from `i` to `alpha`, from `count` to `tracker`), making sure they differ as much as possible from the originals.
- Change control flow styles extensively: turn iterative loops into recursive functions or vice versa wherever feasible, convert for-loops to while-loops or do-while loops or equivalent recursion patterns, and vice versa, carefully maintaining behavior.
- Replace control constructs with logically equivalent alternatives, such as:
  - converting if-else chains into switch-case structures or nested conditionals,
  - unrolling or refactoring conditionals,
  - substituting arithmetic or logical operations with equivalent expressions or use alternate operators or short-circuit logic.
- Rearrange independent statements or blocks without changing overall logic, including reordering variable declarations and assignments where order independence applies.
- Substitute standard data structures with alternative equivalent representations or idiomatic usages (e.g., replacing arrays with lists, maps with dictionaries), and use different but equivalent operations/methods for data access and mutation.
- Transform expression syntax and styleâ€”e.g., adopt different notations for array indexing, pointer referencing, or function calls; rewrite arithmetic using alternate properties (commutativity, distributive laws).
- Vary formatting extensively: apply diverse indentation styles, line breaks, spacing, keyword capitalization, or pseudocode conventions.
- Strictly keep all function parameter names as-is to ensure interface consistency.
- Never add, delete, or move classes or functions, or alter their order or nesting structure.
- Do not introduce any comments, documentation lines, or or any text other than the pseudocode itself in your output.

In summary, your output must look like a fully reimagined pseudocode version that executes identically, uses the exact class/function names and interfaces in the original structure, but is otherwise drastically different in variable naming, control flow constructs, syntax style, formatting, and structural details as feasible.
