Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a fully transformed version that is functionally indistinguishable from the original but differs maximally in syntax, structure, and style while strictly preserving all original **class names**, **function names**, **function parameter names (in order)**, **class hierarchies**, **order of definitions**, and **all comments/annotations exactly as they appear (no additions, removals, or edits)**. 

Your transformation **must preserve the full behavioral contracts** (all inputs, outputs, side-effects, return values) identically.

To maximize divergence, you must apply at least **four distinct** transformation categories selected from the following (apply them wherever logically possible throughout the codebase):

1. **Rename every local variable, temporary identifier, and loop counter to new unique names** (never overlapping with original identifiers), using a consistent internal naming convention distinct from the original, e.g., switch from snake_case to PascalCase with Hungarian notation or vice versa, but do not rename classes, functions, or parameters.

2. **Convert iterative control flows into recursion and recursive flows into iteration**, decomposing compound loops or folding tail calls explicitly to alternate control structures.

3. **Replace control flow constructs with logically equivalent variants**, such as swapping if-else chains for switch-case or cascaded ternary expressions, applying early return guard clauses instead of nested conditionals, reordering independent conditional branches, and changing logical operators to equivalent forms (e.g., De Morgan transformations).

4. **Alter data structure representations and access patterns without changing semantics**, including switching arrays for linked lists, tuples, sets, or maps where suitable, replacing explicit indexing with destructuring, iterators, or map/filter constructs conceptually, and varying element access styles.

5. **Rearrange independent statements and code blocks that do not create data or control dependencies**, including splitting or merging statements, inlining simple expressions or unrolling small loops partially.

6. **Employ diverse assignment and expression syntaxes and operator equivalents**, such as swapping =, :=, <- for assignments; expanding compound assignments; rewriting arithmetic with algebraically equivalent forms; changing boolean expressions to equivalent alternatives.

7. **Radically vary formatting and layout**, including indentation styles and depths, spacing, line breaks, comment formatting styles (block, inline, trailing), and blank lines, without adding or removing any comments.

8. **Replace single statements with logically equivalent code blocks or vice versa**, such as inlining function calls, creating helper blocks, or compressing multi-line constructs.

Strictly **forbid any renaming or restructuring** that modifies:

- Class names, hierarchies, or their order
- Function names or their parameter names or order
- Comments or annotations (no changes whatsoever)
- Interface contracts, return values, or observable behavior

Output only the fully transformed pseudocode snippet â€” no explanation, introduction, or extraneous text.

Your goal is to produce maximally dissimilar pseudocode with truly varied syntax and structure while guaranteeing perfect semantic equivalence and adherence to all constraints above, ensuring the same class and function structure, names, parameters, and comments remain exactly intact.
