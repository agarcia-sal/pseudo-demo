Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce a semantically identical pseudocode output that preserves all original functionality perfectly, including the exact function names, class names, and their nesting or object structures, without any alteration or reordering of classes or functions. Your rewritten pseudocode must differ from the original as much as possible in *all* other respects: thoroughly rename all local variables and loop indices with distinctly different names, transform control flow by converting loops to recursion or vice versa where applicable, replace control constructs with logically equivalent alternatives (e.g., switch from for-loops to while-loops), reorder independent statements when possible, use alternative but equivalent data structures or operations, and vary syntax, formatting, and indentation styles extensively. Do not add or remove comments, annotations, or explanationsâ€”output only the modified pseudocode. Ensure that parameter names within function signatures remain unchanged to avoid interface signature mismatches, but internal variable names should be radically altered. Aim for maximal syntactic, stylistic, and structural divergence while guaranteeing identical behavior and interfaces.
