Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate and output only one fully rewritten pseudocode version that is functionally and semantically identical to the original—preserving *all* runtime behavior, outputs, interfaces, class hierarchies, class and function names, and exact parameter names and order—while maximizing *syntactic, structural, and stylistic* divergence. Your rewriting must satisfy these strict constraints:

- **Do not add, remove, rename, reorder, or alter in any way**:
  - Class names, their nested structure, hierarchy, or order.
  - Function names, parameter names, parameter order, and function signatures.
  - Comments and annotations in content, order, and quantity (no modifications allowed).
  - Interface contracts including all return statements and outputs.

Within these restrictions, apply a *diverse combination* of transformations, using *at least four distinct* of the following strategies (preferably combined multiple times per logical block), intelligently and semantically safely:

1. **Rename all local variables, temporary identifiers, and loop counters consistently, without overlapping original names**, applying systematic and contextual renamings including advanced naming convention switches (e.g. integrate Hungarian notation, snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase, or consistent abbreviation schemes).

2. **Transform recursion into iteration and iteration into recursion bidirectionally wherever logically feasible.**

3. **Replace control flow patterns with semantically equivalent but structurally distinct alternatives**, including but not limited to:
   - Switch-case ↔ if-else chains ↔ guard clauses ↔ early returns ↔ nested ternary expressions.
   - Reordering of *independent* branches or guards to reorder execution paths.
   - Emulating loops via recursion or vice versa.

4. **Alter data structure representations or access patterns**, such as:
   - Substitute arrays for equivalent linked-lists, sets, hash maps, or tuples, while preserving semantic meaning.
   - Replace direct element access by destructuring, iterators, explicit indexing, or pattern matching equivalents.

5. **Rearrange independent statements and code blocks extensively within their local scope**, ensuring no semantic or data dependency violations.

6. **Modify expression syntax and assignment styles**, including use of alternative assignment operators (`<-`, `:=`), expand compound assignments (e.g., `x += y` → `x = x + y`), rewrite arithmetic expressions with equivalent formulae, and reorder commutative operations.

7. **Radically vary formatting and layout choices**, including (but not limited to) unconventional indentation styles, combining or splitting statements across lines, switching comment styles (line/block/inline) without content change.

8. **Refactor code structure by inlining or extracting functions, unrolling loops partially or fully, merging or splitting statements vs blocks, and changing statement grouping**, but always preserving behavior.

9. **Where applicable, invert conditionals and use De Morgan’s laws to rewrite Boolean expressions equivalently but differently.**

**Strict prohibitions:**

- No addition or removal of classes or functions, or changes in their order or nesting.
- No alteration to function signatures, parameter names/order, or return types and values.
- No modification, deletion, or insertion of comments or annotations.
- No change in algorithmic logic, output, or side effects.
- No reuse of any local variable or temporary identifier names from the original pseudocode.

**Output only the complete transformed pseudocode snippet with the same class/function structures and interface elements as the input.**  
Avoid explanations, notes, or any text besides the fully transformed pseudocode.

This approach should yield maximum syntactic and stylistic novelty while perfectly preserving all original functionality and interfaces.
