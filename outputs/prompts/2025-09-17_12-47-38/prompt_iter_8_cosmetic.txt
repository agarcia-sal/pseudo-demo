Given an input pseudocode snippet, output a rewritten pseudocode version that is functionally and semantically equivalent, preserving all original interface elements exactly—including all function names, parameter names, class names, and their hierarchy or nesting structures—without changing the order or presence of classes and functions. Within these constraints, transform the pseudocode as extensively as possible according to the following criteria to maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence:

- Replace **all** local variable names, loop counters, and temporary identifiers with entirely different, consistently renamed variables that avoid overlap with original names while preserving logic.
- Convert iterative constructs (for, while loops) into their logically equivalent recursive formulations where feasible; conversely, convert recursive calls into loops.
- Substitute control flow constructs with alternative, equivalent patterns—for example, using conditional expressions instead of if-else blocks, or decomposing complex conditionals into nested simpler controls, or rearranging branches without changing overall logic.
- Change data representations where possible, e.g., replace arrays with linked lists or maps as logically allowed, or swap usage of built-in operations with equivalent manual operations.
- Reorder independent statements or blocks when it does not affect functionality or data dependencies.
- Modify syntactic style including changing assignment operators, replacing explicit index notation with inline destructuring or tuple unpacking where appropriate, or vice versa.
- Alter formatting aggressively: vary indentation style and depth, apply consistent but different naming conventions such as snake_case vs camelCase vs Hungarian notation internally, and apply different comment styles if present (without adding or removing comments).
- Avoid adding, removing, or modifying comments, annotations, or the order of definitions; produce no extra text, explanation, or output beyond the transformed pseudocode.
- Maintain exact function signatures: function names and their parameter names must be unchanged from the input.
- Preserve all class names and nesting exactly and do not change their order or disrupt object/class structures.

Output only the fully transformed pseudocode following these instructions, ensuring behavior and interfaces are identical but the new version is as syntactically, structurally, semantically, and stylistically distinct as possible from the input.
