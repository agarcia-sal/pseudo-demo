Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a functionally identical pseudocode output that strictly preserves all original function names, class names, and their exact nesting and object-oriented structures without any modifications, additions, or reordering of these elements. The output must be **only** the rewritten pseudocode, with no comments, explanations, or annotations.

Within these boundaries, maximize the syntactic, stylistic, and structural divergence from the original pseudocode as much as possible while maintaining perfect semantic equivalence. To achieve this:

- Rename **all local variables, loop counters, and temporary identifiers** to completely different, contextually consistent namesâ€”do not reuse or partially reuse original names or intuitive variants.
- Transform all control flow constructs into logically equivalent but structurally distinct forms. For example:
  - Convert loops to recursion or recursion to loops where feasible.
  - Replace `for` loops with `while` loops or vice versa.
  - Substitute `if-else` chains with equivalent `switch`/`case` or nested conditional expressions where applicable.
  - Restructure conditionals logically without changing semantics.
- Reorder independent statements and expressions wherever no dependency or correctness violation occurs, including but not limited to initialization, assignments, or checks.
- Replace data structures or operations with alternative, equivalent constructs (e.g., use explicit arrays vs. lists, maps vs. associative arrays, or different indexing techniques) as long as behavior is unaffected.
- Vary formatting styles and indentation thoroughly, using diverse capitalization, spacing, line breaks, and statement delimiters consistent with pseudocode conventions.
- Maintain all function parameter names exactly as in the original for interface compatibility; do **not** rename parameters.
- Do **not** add or remove any functionality, side effects, or algorithmic steps.
- Preserve all external API calls and their argument order intact.
- Do **not** output anything other than the fully rewritten pseudocode itself.

Your task is to produce a maximally divergent but perfectly equivalent version of the input pseudocode under these strict constraints.
