Given a pseudocode input, generate a rewritten version that is fully functionally equivalent—retaining exactly the same behavior, outputs, interfaces, function signatures (including parameter names and order), class names, hierarchy, and nesting as the original—but which differs maximally in all aspects of syntax, structure, style, and naming within the allowed constraints.

**Mandatory constraints (unchangeable):**  
- Preserve all original **class names**, their hierarchy, nesting, order, and structure exactly.  
- Preserve all original **function names**, with their parameter names and order exactly as given.  
- Preserve every comment and annotation exactly as in the original, including position and wording; no comment additions, removals, or edits allowed.  
- Preserve all return/output semantics and interface contracts exactly (no logic or output changes).  
- Do not modify or remove class or function definitions, their order, or nesting.  

**Rewrite requirements:**  
- Apply **at least 4 distinct transformation types** (from the list below) per logical code block to maximize syntactic, stylistic, and semantic structural divergence while maintaining semantics.  
- Wherever possible, combine multiple transformation types on each code fragment to maximize rewrite depth and diversity.

**Allowed, encouraged transformations (choose at least 4 distinct):**

1. **Rename all local variables, loop indices, and temporaries consistently, using entirely new identifiers that do not overlap with any original names.**  
2. **Convert iterative loops to recursive calls and vice versa, maintaining termination and functional equivalence where feasible.**  
3. **Rewrite control flow constructs using alternate logically equivalent forms:**  
  - Replace if-else chains with switch-case or nested guards/early returns.  
  - Use conditional expressions (ternary operators) where applicable.  
  - Reorder independent branches or statements safely.  
4. **Change data structures preserving semantics:**  
  - Replace arrays with linked lists, tuples, dictionaries, or sets as contextually appropriate.  
  - Switch between accessing elements by direct indexing, unpacking, or iterators.  
5. **Rearrange order of independent statements or reorder code blocks without introducing data or control dependencies.**  
6. **Alter assignment and operator syntax:**  
  - Use alternate assignment operators (`:=`, `<-`, `=`) where valid.  
  - Expand or contract compound assignments (`+=` to `x = x + y`) with equivalent expressions.  
  - Rewrite arithmetic expressions into equivalent forms (e.g., `x - y` as `x + (-y)`).  
7. **Change naming convention internally for local identifiers only:** convert between snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase, or Hungarian notation.  
8. **Radically vary formatting style:** indentation style and depth, line breaks, spacing, and type of comments (inline, block, line) without deleting or adding comments.  
9. **Restructure code blocks for equivalence:**  
  - Inline simple function calls or extract repeated statements into helper functions (if originally absent).  
  - Unroll simple loops partially or fully where safe.  
  - Replace single statements with equivalent multiple statements or vice versa.  

**Strict prohibitions:**  
- Do NOT rename or reorder classes or functions or their parameters.  
- Do NOT add, remove, or modify comments or annotations.  
- Do NOT alter any external visible outputs, return values, or side effects.  
- Do NOT remove or add any logic that changes control flow effects beyond equivalence preserving rewrites.  

**Output only the rewritten pseudocode with absolutely no added explanation, markup, or text.**  
Focus on maximal combination of transformations to produce substantially distinct pseudocode while maintaining perfect functional parity and identical API/class/method structures.
