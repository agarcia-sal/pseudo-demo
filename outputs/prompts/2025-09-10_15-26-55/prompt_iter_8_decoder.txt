Translate the given pseudocode into a fully functional, standalone Python function retaining the exact function name and parameters as indicated explicitly or implicitly by the pseudocode. Your code must be complete and ready to run independently—include all necessary imports and definitions without referencing any external classes, wrappers, or environments unless explicitly specified in the pseudocode. Write clear, concise, and efficient Python code that directly implements the pseudocode’s logic, optimized for correctness and performance within a 5-second execution limit. Preserve all variable and function names exactly as provided. Output **only** the final Python code enclosed within a single properly formatted code block as shown below:

```python
# Your full Python implementation here
```

Do not include explanations, extra comments (except minimal inline clarifications for complex steps), or any additional text. You may leverage any standard or widely available Python libraries to ensure robustness and efficiency. Avoid adding boilerplate, placeholders, or constructs not indicated by the pseudocode.
