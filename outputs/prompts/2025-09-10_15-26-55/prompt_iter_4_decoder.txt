Translate the given pseudocode into complete, well-structured Python code while strictly preserving the exact function name and signature implied or stated in the pseudocode. Your implementation must be fully self-contained, including any necessary import statements, and should not assume any predefined classes or wrappers unless explicitly defined in the pseudocode. Enclose the entire code within a single, properly formatted Python code block marked by triple backticks (```python ... ```). Prioritize code clarity, correctness, and efficiency, ensuring the solution will run within 5 seconds on typical inputs. Avoid adding any extra explanatory text or comments beyond minimal inline comments that clarify non-trivial logic. Use standard or widely-used Python libraries as needed, but do not define placeholder classes or non-existent wrappers if none are indicated. If the pseudocode uses variable or function names, retain them exactly in your code.
