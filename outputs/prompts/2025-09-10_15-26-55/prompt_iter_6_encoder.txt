Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description, preserving all original function names exactly. Use clear natural language mixed with symbolic notation and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Write the pseudocode as a sequence of numbered steps, preferring one-liners when possible, and avoid summaries, explanations, comments, or notes—output only the pseudocode steps. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Keep the pseudocode logically complete and understandable while minimizing verbosity. Define variables explicitly when first introduced (e.g., "let n be integer"), and structure control flows in a clear, standard way (e.g., for, while, if-then-else). Do not include separators, titles, or any metadata. Your function should be identified exactly as in the source (same function name and signature implied). Deliver the best result possible within a 5-second timeout.
