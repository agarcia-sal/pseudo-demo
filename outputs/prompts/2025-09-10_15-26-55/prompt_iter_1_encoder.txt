Generate concise, easy-to-read pseudocode from the given problem description. Use natural language, symbolic representations, and abbreviations to keep it compact and high-level. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations—only the pseudocode steps. Format the pseudocode similarly to:  
1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
Aim for one-liners where possible and maintain clarity. Your function has a 5-second timeout; produce the best possible result within this limit.
