Given the pseudocode below, determine **strictly by examining the text only, with no external assumptions or simulation**, whether the pseudocode is specified in an absolutely unambiguous, complete, and deterministic manner so that **any correct faithful implementation exactly following it will pass all associated unit tests perfectly**.

Output **exactly one digit** per pseudocode input—`1` if and only if the pseudocode guarantees complete reproducibility (i.e., all unit tests pass with no exceptions or ambiguity), or `0` otherwise.

### Analysis criteria (all must be fully and explicitly satisfied):

1. **Explicit, Precise, and Aligned Interface Definition**  
   - All classes, functions, and methods are uniquely and clearly named.  
   - Function/class signatures exactly match the expected testing framework interface with correct parameter names, types, counts, and return types. No unspecified or implicit assumptions about interfaces allowed.  
   - Variables, constants, and data structures used anywhere are explicitly declared or introduced and initialized unambiguously before use. No uninitialized, reused-without-clear-overwrite, or vaguely described variables permitted.

2. **Unambiguous and Complete Algorithmic Specification**  
   - Every step of the algorithm, including all computations, state updates, control-flow logic, data mutations, and side effects, is expressly and precisely described without missing detail.  
   - Loop bounds, recursion bases, and conditionals have exact criteria that guarantee termination and exhaustiveness over the input domain, preventing any infinite loops or undefined behaviors.  
   - No conditional or instruction admits multiple plausible interpretations; all operators, expressions, and statements are fully specified in meaning and effect.  
   - Assumptions, invariants, preconditions, and postconditions that affect correctness or completeness must be explicitly detailed or directly derivable without inference beyond the text.  
   - No omitted or ambiguous handling allowed at any point — if any behavior is implied but not clearly spelled out, require output `0`.

3. **Complete and Explicit Edge Case Management**  
   - All relevant edge cases (empty inputs, boundary sizes, special characters or values, invalid inputs if in scope, minimal/maximal constraints) are explicitly managed or clearly and unambiguously accounted for in the pseudocode; silent or implicit edge case handling not allowed.  
   - Indexing or access operations include explicit, exact bounds checks or clearly defined safe assumptions preventing any out-of-bound or invalid memory/data access.  
   - Any exceptional cases must be handled clearly or explicitly omitted with valid rationale stated; uncertainty or silent assumptions mandate output `0`.

4. **Deterministic, Implementation-Independent Specification**  
   - The pseudocode is fully self-contained: no reliance on external/global variables, runtime environment state, hidden memory, or I/O side effects beyond declared inputs and outputs.  
   - No randomness, concurrency, non-deterministic ordering, platform-dependent behavior, or undefined evaluation order permitted.  
   - For every valid input, the pseudocode defines exactly one unique output deterministically and reproducibly.

5. **Direct Implementability Without Guesswork**  
   - The pseudocode can be implemented as-is in a typical standard programming language and testing harness with no added assumptions, helper functions, or external libraries not defined or specified within the pseudocode.  
   - The interface and expected interactions perfectly align with the unit test harness (correct parameter names, argument ordering, return values).  
   - No critical implementation detail is omitted that would force guesswork or environment-specific fixes.

---

### Decision rules:
- If **any one** of the above conditions is violated, uncertain, ambiguous, contradictory, incomplete, or leaves any critical inference to guessing, output `0`.  
- Do **not** accept partial, approximate, or "mostly correct" specifications—only perfectly, explicitly complete and correct pseudocode merits `1`.  
- Treat naming, typing, initialization, control flow, edge cases, and interfaces with strict exactness, matching the test environment in every detail.  
- Recursive or iterative structures must have clearly provable termination conditions specified without exceptions.  
- Precise correctness and traceability of every intermediate variable and operation are mandatory.

### Output format:  
For each pseudocode input, **print exactly one digit: `1` or `0`**, on its own line, preserving the input order. No extra text, punctuation, explanation, or formatting allowed.

This prompt implements a rigorous reproducibility verification emphasizing **explicitness, exactness, completeness, determinism, and alignment to the test harness**—ensuring robust discrimination between fully reproducible pseudocode and any unsound or incomplete specification.
