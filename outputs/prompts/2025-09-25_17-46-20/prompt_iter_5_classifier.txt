Given the pseudocode below, **without running or simulating it**, determine whether it is specified with complete precision, unambiguity, and correctness so that **any faithful implementation strictly following this pseudocode will guaranteedly pass all unit tests designed to verify the described functionality**.

Your judgment must rigorously verify that:

1. **Complete Specification:**  
   - All functions, methods, classes, and procedures are fully defined with clear names and explicit input/output parameters (including types if specified).  
   - All variables and data structures are declared or clearly introduced, with initial states or values explicitly given where relevant.  
   - All control flow structures (loops, conditionals, recursion, iteration) are exhaustively described, specifying all conditions and update stepsâ€”no implicit or vague transitions.  
   - All data operations, computations, and assignments are fully detailed, avoiding assumptions about language-specific behavior or hidden side effects.

2. **Correctness of Logic and Algorithm:**  
   - The pseudocode implements an algorithm that logically fulfills the problem requirements as described or implied.  
   - There are no internal contradictions, missing critical steps, or logically inconsistent instructions.  
   - Any necessary algorithmic invariants or conditions ensuring correctness are either explicitly stated or unambiguously deducible.

3. **Handling of Edge and Boundary Cases:**  
   - All relevant edge cases and boundary conditions (empty inputs, minimum/maximum values, exceptional scenarios) are explicitly handled or their safe handling is clearly implied by the pseudocode.  
   - Loops and recursion have well-defined termination criteria guaranteeing they cannot run infinitely or get stuck.

4. **Determinism and Reproducibility:**  
   - The pseudocode does not depend on unstated external state, platform-specific features, or non-deterministic behavior.  
   - Given the same inputs, any implementer following these instructions precisely will produce exactly the intended outputs under all valid test cases.

5. **Conformance to the Intended Interface:**  
   - The pseudocode provides entry points (functions/methods) matching expected names and signatures, enabling direct testing by external unit test frameworks without requirement for additional scaffolding.

**Instructions for output:**  
- Output exactly one single digit, **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets *all* above criteria ensuring full reproducibility and guaranteed success in passing all unit tests for the described function.  
- Output **0** if there exists any ambiguity, omission, logical flaw, incomplete edge-case coverage, implicit assumptions, or under-specification that could lead to failure or inconsistent implementations.

**Important:** Output strictly the digit (1 or 0), no explanations, no formatting, no additional text.  
The order of outputs must correspond directly to the order in which pseudocodes are fed into the prompt.
