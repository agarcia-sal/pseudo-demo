Given the pseudocode below, determine **without any execution or simulation** whether it is fully and unambiguously specified such that **every faithful implementation derived from it will pass all unit tests in every scenario without exception**.

Output exactly one character per pseudocode:  
- **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** the following criteria, guaranteeing perfect reproducibility and test passability;  
- **0** otherwise (if **any** ambiguity, incompleteness, unspecified behavior, logical flaw, missing or implicit assumption, incomplete edge-case handling, or non-determinism exists).

### Comprehensive Reproducibility Criteria:

1. **Complete and Explicit Definition of Interface & Data:**  
   - Every class, function, method, or procedure is fully named and declared with exact input parameter names, types (if given), and return type clearly specified and unambiguous.  
   - Every variable, constant, and data structure used is explicitly declared or defined with scope and initial state/value prior to read or modification.  
   - The pseudocode’s entry points and callable entities align precisely with the test framework’s requirements—parameter lists and return formats must match exactly, with no assumptions or omissions.

2. **Algorithmic Clarity, Determinism, and Completeness:**  
   - All control flows (loops, recursions, conditionals) are fully and explicitly bounded with precise, verifiable termination conditions covering all valid inputs—no possible infinite, undefined, or ambiguous iteration/recursion.  
   - Each computational or transformation step is explicitly specified, with no reliance on implicit conversions, side effects, or behaviors depending on external environment details or language-specific defaults.  
   - The solution fully addresses the problem specification, with no missing intermediate computations, ambiguous steps, or logical gaps.  
   - Assumptions, preconditions, and invariants critical for correctness are explicitly stated or mechanically derivable from given definitions and code content only—never inferred beyond the provided text.  
   - No step, condition, or outcome allows multiple valid interpretations; any such ambiguity mandates output **0**.

3. **Exhaustive and Precise Edge Case & Boundary Handling:**  
   - All relevant edge cases (empty inputs, minimum/maximum input sizes, special values, invalid or unusual inputs, boundary indices) are explicitly addressed, handled without ambiguity, or explicitly reasoned about.  
   - Indexing, slicing, data access patterns are fully specified and guaranteed safe; no possibility of out-of-bounds, undefined behavior, or silent error conditions.  
   - Any exceptions, error cases, or corner situations are either explicitly handled or clearly declared as out-of-scope; silent or implicit handling causing inconsistent behavior causes a **0** output.

4. **Absolute Implementation Independence and Determinism:**  
   - No reliance on external or global states not passed explicitly to the pseudocode; all state and dependencies are self-contained.  
   - No platform, hardware, randomness, concurrency, probabilistic, or non-deterministic constructs; given the exact same input, the output and side-effects (if any) are uniquely and fully determined.  
   - No unspecified order of operations or hidden assumptions about evaluation order.

5. **Full Self-Containment and Direct Translability:**  
   - The pseudocode is standalone and complete: it can be directly implemented without needing additional helper functions, scaffolding, environment assumptions, or unspecified libraries/modules.  
   - The structure and interface map clearly and directly to the expected unit test harness usage—no interface adaptation, wrapper code, or external context should be required.

### Strict Evaluation Rules and Operational Notes:

- If any variable is read before explicit initialization, output **0**.  
- If any function or callable entity’s signature deviates from what test harness expects (parameter count, names, or types), output **0**.  
- Recursive or iterative constructs must state provable termination conditions; lacking these, output **0**.  
- Do not infer implicit conventions, "common sense" defaults, or external knowledge beyond explicitly stated content.  
- All variable updates, data transformations, intermediate states must be fully traceable and unambiguous.  
- Contradictions, inconsistencies, or conflicting steps automatically cause a **0**.  
- Output order must strictly correspond to the order of pseudocode inputs.

---

### Output Instructions:

- Provide only a single character **1** or **0** for each pseudocode input.  
- No additional text, explanation, formatting, or whitespace is permitted.

This prompt is designed as a rigorous mechanical checklist emphasizing absolute explicitness, clarity, and unambiguous completeness, thereby maximizing accuracy in distinguishing reproducible from non-reproducible pseudocode—even in borderline or near-miss cases.
