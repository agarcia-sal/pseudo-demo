Given the pseudocode below, determine if it is **fully and rigorously specified to guarantee perfect reproducibility**, meaning **any correct implementation strictly following it will pass all unit tests exactly and without exception**.

Without simulating or executing, output **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets **all** of the criteria below; otherwise, output **0**.

### Essential Criteria for Perfect Reproducibility

1. **Explicit, Complete, and Precise Interface and Structure**  
   - All code entities (functions, methods, classes) are uniquely named and declared with fully explicit parameter lists (names, exact expected types, and order) and return types or values.  
   - The declared interface matches exactly the external testing environment’s expectations (parameter names, types, counts, and return values) without any implicit or inferred assumptions.  
   - All variables, constants, and data structures are clearly declared or introduced, with explicit initializations or guarantees of valid initial states before usage; no uninitialized or conditionally initialized items remain.  
   - Entry points (e.g., main functions) and all nested scopes conform strictly to the required module/class/method structure and expected visibility.

2. **Deterministic, Complete Algorithm Description Without Ambiguity**  
   - Control flows (loops, recursion, conditionals) have explicit, complete, and unambiguous conditions and precise boundaries (indices, ranges), ensuring guaranteed termination for every valid input scenario.  
   - Every computational step, state update, and data transformation is precisely defined, avoiding any dependence on external context, language-specific behavior, or undefined operations.  
   - The pseudocode covers the entire problem scope with no missing steps, undefined behaviors, or unstated assumptions beyond the literal specification.  
   - All invariants, preconditions, and postconditions relevant to correctness must be explicitly stated or clearly and logically derivable without guesswork. Any ambiguity or multiple valid interpretations invalidates reproducibility.

3. **Exhaustive Edge Case and Boundary Condition Handling**  
   - All relevant edge, boundary, and special cases (empty inputs, minimal or maximal sizes, invalid inputs) are explicitly handled or unambiguously implied with no contradictions or omissions.  
   - Indexing, array/list access, and data retrieval operations strictly maintain bounds and offsets with no possibility of invalid or out-of-range access.  
   - If any exceptional cases are outside the scope, this exclusion must be explicitly and precisely stated with sound rationale.

4. **Implementation-Agnostic, Fully Deterministic Behavior**  
   - The pseudocode is fully self-contained: no reliance on global/external state, hidden variables, randomness, concurrency, or environment-specific features.  
   - All outputs are uniquely determined by the declared inputs and explicit procedures described; no non-determinism or underspecification is allowed.  
   - Ordering of all operations is explicitly specified or immaterial; if ordering affects outcomes and is unspecified, reproducibility fails.

5. **Direct and Complete Implementability Matching Test Harness Exactly**  
   - The pseudocode can be directly and unambiguously translated into a working implementation without requiring extra helper functions, additional libraries, external scaffolding, or environment-specific hacks.  
   - Function and class signatures (names, parameters, return types) exactly match the expected test harness format, ensuring straightforward integration and testing.  
   - No critical detail is left unspecified that would force guesswork or assumptions during implementation.

### Decision and Evaluation Rules

- **Strictly require full explicitness and completeness:** Absence, ambiguity, or contradiction anywhere—especially in interfaces, initialization, control flow termination, or edge case handling—mandates output `0`.  
- Do not rely on assumed common sense, conventions, or implicit knowledge; judge only on what is precisely and literally specified.  
- If multiple plausible but distinct interpretations exist that could affect correctness, output `0`.  
- Any undemonstrated or implied termination guarantees, implicit data mutation, or vague behavior lead to `0`.  
- Confirm that all intermediate data states and transitions are fully traceable and explicit.  
- Output exactly one digit (`1` or `0`) per input pseudocode in the order given, with no extra text or formatting.

**Final output:**  
- Output `1` if the pseudocode is guaranteed reproducible in the above rigorous sense.  
- Output `0` otherwise.

This prompt applies a holistic, uncompromising standard emphasizing **precision, rigor, unambiguity, and direct implementability** to maximize accuracy in identifying truly reproducible pseudocode under strict unit-test passing criteria.
