Given the pseudocode below, **without executing or simulating it**, output **1** if **and only if** the pseudocode is fully specified, self-contained, and unambiguously defined such that **any implementation strictly following it will pass all unit tests verifying the described functionality**; otherwise, output **0**.

To decide between **1** (reproducible) and **0** (not reproducible), strictly and comprehensively verify **all** of the following:

---

### 1. Complete and Explicit Specification
- All functions, methods, classes, procedures, inputs, and outputs are explicitly declared with clear, unambiguous names.
- Input parameters and return values are fully specified, including expected input types, data structures, and exact output formats where possible.
- All variables, constants, and data structures are explicitly initialized or defined before use; no reliance on unspecified defaults or implicit initial states.
- Control flow structures (loops, conditionals, recursion) include exact loop bounds, conditions, increments, and termination criteria with no ambiguity or missing details.
- Every operation, calculation, assignment, and state mutation is fully described to avoid any underspecification or dependence on unspecified behaviors.
- The pseudocode defines an exact interface matching the testing framework’s expected callable units without implicit assumptions or missing entry points.

### 2. Logical and Algorithmic Soundness
- The pseudocode logically solves the specified problem or clearly implied problem scope with no contradictions, missing essential steps, or illogical flows.
- All key algorithmic invariants, preconditions, postconditions, and assumptions relevant to correctness are explicitly stated or unambiguously derivable solely from the pseudocode.
- Any recursive or iterative algorithms have explicit, verifiable base cases or termination conditions ensuring correctness and termination.

### 3. Exhaustive Edge Case Handling
- Edge cases—including empty inputs, minimal inputs, maximum boundary inputs, and special/exceptional inputs—are explicitly handled or their correct handling is clearly and unambiguously implied in the pseudocode.
- Termination conditions for loops and recursion guarantee no infinite or uncontrolled iterations.
- Error conditions, boundary constraints, and special input variants are covered without gaps.

### 4. Determinism and Implementation Independence
- The pseudocode does not depend on any external state, environment, randomization, or platform-specific behaviors.
- Given identical inputs, all compliant implementations must produce the same deterministic outputs consistently.

### 5. Self-Containment and Direct Testability
- The pseudocode can be fully implemented faithfully as-is without requiring unstated scaffolding, external libraries, or undefined helper constructs.
- Declared functions, methods, or classes correspond exactly to the callable units expected by unit tests; signatures and accessibility are explicit and unambiguous.

---

### Additional Strict Requirements  
- Any form of ambiguity, under-specification, or incomplete information invalidates reproducibility and requires output `0`.
- Do **not** assume or infer semantics beyond what is explicitly stated or can be unambiguously derived from the pseudocode.
- Confirm explicit naming consistency: function names in pseudocode must exactly match those expected by the test harness, including case and parameter order.
- All control flow bounds and array/list indexing must be explicit and zero- or one-based consistently with the pseudocode’s own conventions.
- All variables and data mutations must be traceable without gaps: no implicit side effects or hidden state changes are allowed.
- Recursive or iterative loops must have explicit, non-trivial termination conditions provably ensuring finite execution.

---

### Output instructions:
- After carefully applying the above criteria, output exactly one digit per pseudocode input, with no extra text or formatting:
  
  - Output **`1`** if the pseudocode meets **all** reproducibility criteria, guaranteeing all unit tests pass for any correct implementation strictly following it.
  
  - Output **`0`** otherwise.

- The output digits must be in the same order as the pseudocode inputs are fed.

This directive enforces a thorough, formal, and holistic validation, prioritizing **explicitness**, **logical rigor**, **completeness**, and **testability** to maximize accurate reproducibility classification.
