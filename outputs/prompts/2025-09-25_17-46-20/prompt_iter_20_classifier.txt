Given the pseudocode below, **without simulating or executing it**, output **exactly one character: `1` if and only if the pseudocode fully guarantees perfect reproducibility (i.e., *any* faithful implementation derived solely from it will pass all unit tests without exception), otherwise output `0` with no extra text or formatting.** The output order must correspond exactly to the input order of pseudocodes.

To determine reproducibility, apply this **comprehensive, fail-fast checklist** ensuring **every single condition is explicitly or unambiguously met**, else return `0` immediately:

---

### 1. Complete, Explicit Interface & Structural Definition  
- The pseudocode explicitly declares all classes, functions, and procedures with unique names exactly matching expected test harness signatures (including parameter names, types, and return types if specified).  
- Inputs, outputs, and intermediate variables (including their types, initial values, and scopes) are clearly declared or deterministically inferable without assumption.  
- The pseudocode is fully self-contained—no dependencies on any external code, libraries, states, or hidden environment behavior.  
- All data structures, constants, and auxiliary components used are defined or described in full detail.

### 2. Algorithmic Exactness & Determinism  
- Every computational step, control flow decision, and update is explicitly specified; no step is left underspecified or ambiguous.  
- Control constructs (loops, recursion) have clearly stated, enforceable entry, progress, and termination conditions **for all valid inputs**, guaranteeing halting and preventing infinite loops or unbounded recursion.  
- All operations are deterministic with no randomization, external nondeterminism, undefined execution order, or platform-specific assumptions.  
- The logical flow covers every required transformation and step needed to solve the implied problem without missing cases or partial reasoning.  
- No ambiguous interpretations or multiple valid semantics exist for any operation, condition, or control construct.

### 3. Exhaustive Edge Case & Boundary Coverage  
- All critical edge cases, including empty, minimal, maximal inputs, and special/problematic values, are handled explicitly or with clearly justified and unambiguous logic that ensures correctness.  
- Boundary conditions, such as index ranges, off-by-one handling, and data access are precisely and unambiguously defined, with no possibility of out-of-range or undefined behavior.  
- Exceptional or error cases are either handled or explicitly stated as out of scope; silent omissions or implicit handling of exceptions count as incompleteness.

### 4. Logical Consistency & Traceability  
- No contradictions, conflicting assignments, or inconsistent state updates occur anywhere in the pseudocode.  
- Each variable’s lifecycle — initialization, update, use — is fully traceable without gaps or unexplained side effects.  
- Intermediate states and data transformations are specified clearly enough that their correctness can be independently verified without guessing.  
- Any assumptions, invariants, or preconditions essential for correctness are clearly stated or can be unambiguously derived from the pseudocode itself, never relying on external knowledge.

### 5. Interface Compatibility & Implementability  
- The pseudocode’s structure and signature make it directly and faithfully implementable without additional scaffolding or guessing.  
- No mismatch exists between the pseudocode’s interface and what the unit test framework expects — parameter names, number, order, and return types are in strict agreement.  
- The output format and return values conform precisely to what the tests require.

---

### Additional inference rules to avoid false positives/negatives:  
- **Do not guess or infer missing details**, even if such omissions seem minor or "obvious." Missing explicitness leads to output `0`.  
- Any hint of implicit behaviors, assumed defaults, or open-ended specifications results in output `0`.  
- If control flows (loops, recursion) do not include **provable termination logic valid for all inputs**, output `0`.  
- Mark as unreproducible (`0`) if interfaces or method names differ from expected testing signatures or are undefined.  
- If variable initialization is unclear or partial, or if data transformations rely on unspecified side effects, output `0`.  
- Returning or modifying data improperly typed or formatted relative to the specification mandates output `0`.  
- Contradictory or logically impossible steps mandate output `0`.

---

By rigorously enforcing these rules in order, your output will accurately and reliably indicate **1 for reproducible pseudocode** and **0 otherwise**, strictly maintaining input order with no extra output.

---

**Remember: Output only a single digit per input pseudocode—`1` or `0`—no additional text, formatting, or explanation.**
