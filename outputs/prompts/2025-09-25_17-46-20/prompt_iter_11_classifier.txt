Given the pseudocode below, **without performing any execution, emulation, or inference beyond what is explicitly presented**, output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is so precisely and completely specified that **every possible implementation strictly following it—without adding, omitting, or modifying any detail—will pass all valid and relevant unit tests for the described problem**; otherwise, output **0**.

To decide, critically and exhaustively verify that the pseudocode meets **all** of the following stringent conditions:

1. **Absolute Structural and Interface Explicitness:**  
   - All functions, methods, classes, or procedures are uniquely and consistently named and include exact, explicit signatures listing every input parameter and output, including any specified types or constraints.  
   - All variables, constants, and data structures are defined or clearly introduced before use, with initial states or values stated unambiguously.  
   - The overall program/module/class structure aligns exactly with the interfaces expected by any formal testing framework or harness, without requiring additional wrapping, renaming, or assumptions.

2. **Complete Operational Specificity and Unambiguity:**  
   - Every operation, including assignment, arithmetic, logical, data manipulation, and function calls, is precisely and fully described with no ambiguous or underspecified steps.  
   - All control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion) clearly specify their iteration/recursion boundaries, conditions, increments/decrements, and termination criteria, guaranteeing no infinite loops or undefined behavior.  
   - No reliance on implicit defaults, environment-dependent side effects, or language/platform-specific behaviors allowed.  
   - Any branching or conditional statements cover all logically possible relevant cases without gaps or implicit fall-throughs.

3. **Exact Logical and Algorithmic Correctness:**  
   - The pseudocode consistently and concretely implements a logically valid algorithm that fulfills the problem’s specification without contradictions, omissions, or ambiguous steps.  
   - All required invariants, preconditions, postconditions, and assumptions critical to correctness are explicitly stated or unambiguously derivable from the pseudocode itself—no external or implied knowledge permitted.  
   - No ambiguities exist about data indexing, boundary conditions, or algorithmic flow that could alter correctness.

4. **Exhaustive Edge and Corner Case Handling:**  
   - All relevant edge cases (empty inputs, minimal and maximal values, special or exceptional inputs) are explicitly handled or their correct handling is clearly and unambiguously implied by the structure and logic of the pseudocode.  
   - Loops and recursion explicitly guarantee termination for all input cases, preventing infinite execution or hang-ups.

5. **Determinism and Implementation-Agnosticism:**  
   - The pseudocode’s behavior is fully deterministic: for the same inputs, *every* correct implementation following this pseudocode will produce exactly the same outputs.  
   - No part of the pseudocode depends on unstated external state, hidden mutable global variables, randomness, or non-deterministic constructs.  
   - The pseudocode is fully self-contained, requiring no auxiliary code, assumptions, or scaffolding beyond what is present.

6. **Traceability and Completeness of State Transitions:**  
   - Every variable’s lifecycle and state transitions are explicitly traceable and well-defined throughout the pseudocode—no unstated dependencies or side effects.  
   - Recursive calls and their parameters, as well as all iterations, must be fully expressible and verifiable from the pseudocode text.

**Output instructions:**  
- Output a single digit: **1** if and only if *all* above criteria are met absolutely, implying guaranteed reproducibility and guaranteed passing of all unit tests.  
- Output **0** otherwise, if there exists any explicit or implicit ambiguity, incompleteness, contradiction, missing or implicit assumption, or edge case lacking precise handling that could lead to test failures or inconsistent implementations.

**Important:**  
- Output exactly one character—either `1` or `0`—strictly and without any additional text, explanation, whitespace, or formatting.  
- Outputs must be produced in the exact same order as pseudocode inputs are given.

---

**Additional precision rules to avoid false positives/negatives:**  
- Treat any vague, ambiguous, or under-specified variable initialization, control flow boundary, return value, or operation semantics as grounds for output `0`.  
- Confirm that the pseudocode’s interface matches the expected unit test entry points exactly, including parameter names and return values; missing or mismatched interfaces yield `0`.  
- Recursive and iterative constructs must have explicit, verifiable base cases and termination conditions clearly described.  
- Do not attempt to infer correctness beyond what is fully supported by the pseudocode’s explicit logic and statements—abstain from guessing or assumptions.  
- Verify no missing steps or logic holes exist that would allow passing the unit tests only by chance or partial correctness.  
- Handle all specified corner cases; implicit assumptions about default behaviors or input sanitization are not acceptable.  

This prompt enforces a rigorous, formal, and exhaustive standard to classify pseudocode reproducibility reliably, minimizing misclassifications by grounding all judgments strictly in explicit, unambiguous pseudocode content.
