Given the pseudocode below, determine **without any execution, simulation, or assumptions beyond the pseudocode text itself** whether it is *fully reproducible*, i.e., guaranteed to enable **any faithful implementation** derived directly and solely from it to **pass all associated unit tests without failure**.

Output exactly one character per pseudocode:  
- **1** if the pseudocode is fully reproducible, meeting every requirement below rigorously and completely.  
- **0** if it fails *any* single requirement or leaves *any* ambiguity, incompleteness, or unspecified behavior that could cause test failures.

---

To decide, exhaustively verify that the pseudocode satisfies **all** of these criteria:

### 1. **Complete and Explicit Interface and Context**  
- The pseudocode defines all functions, methods, or procedures by explicit, exact names matching the expected test interface, with **full parameter lists, expected parameter types or formats, and return types or value forms** specified.  
- The container (e.g., class or module) structure, if any, is explicit and consistent with test harness expectations, including necessary scoping or access specifications.  
- All variables, data structures, and constants used are explicitly declared or clearly derived *within the pseudocode*, including initial values and types if relevant.  
- No dependencies, global states, or environment interactions occur outside defined parameters and internal declarations.

### 2. **Unambiguous and Fully Determined Algorithm Logic**  
- Every step, operation, and transformation is explicitly described with no gaps or implicit assumptions, including data indexing, arithmetic, control flow (branching, looping, recursion).  
- Control structures have **clear, provably terminating conditions**; no infinite loops, unbounded recursion, or undefined iteration bounds remain implicit or omitted.  
- All logic branches covering input domain and behavior possibilities are defined without contradiction or multiple equally plausible interpretations.  
- No unspecified side effects, language- or platform-dependent behavior, or random/non-deterministic operations exist anywhere.  
- Preconditions, invariants, or assumptions essential for correctness are either clearly stated or concretely implied by the pseudocode content; do not infer any external or unstated assumptions.  
- No ambiguity or room for multiple semantics in any variable, operation, or decision.

### 3. **Complete and Explicit Handling of Edge, Boundary, and Exceptional Cases**  
- All meaningful edge cases—empty inputs, maximal or minimal sizes, zero or special values, invalid inputs, or exceptional data—are either explicitly handled or their correct handling is unequivocally implied by the pseudocode’s precise logic.  
- Index calculations and data access patterns are always safe and well-defined, negating out-of-bounds, underflows, or undefined behaviors.  
- Exceptional or error cases, including return values or side effects, are fully specified or explicitly omitted with clarity. No silent failures or implicit errors tolerated.

### 4. **Deterministic, Stable and Pure Semantics**  
- For each valid input, the pseudocode defines exactly one output and behavior, no randomness, concurrency artifacts, or external influences that affect outcomes.  
- The same inputs always lead to the same outputs and side effects as described by the pseudocode alone.  
- No reliance on external mutable or hidden states except those clearly passed as input or within local scope.

### 5. **Direct Implementability and Self-Containment**  
- The pseudocode is self-contained: it can be fully implemented as given without requiring external scaffolding, helper routines outside those defined, or environment-specific setups.  
- The function/class interfaces, signatures, and behavior directly align with unit test expectations with no required adaptations or corrections.  
- The pseudocode language is consistent and internally coherent, with syntax and semantics fully supporting faithful direct translation.

### Additional strict notes:  
- Any uncertainty about variable initialization, function outputs, control flow termination, or interface correctness is grounds for output `0`.  
- Do **not** fill gaps by guessing or invoking “common sense” beyond explicitly stated information.  
- Recursive or iterative constructs must **explicitly state termination conditions or bounds**; otherwise output `0`.  
- Contradictions, inconsistencies, or logic conflicts always require output `0`.  
- Missing or implicit assumptions that are critical for correctness mandate output `0`.

# Output instructions:  
- Output a single character **per pseudocode**, in the exact order received.  
- Output **only** `1` or `0`, no text, no explanation, no formatting.  
- Ensure strict length and order correspondence.
