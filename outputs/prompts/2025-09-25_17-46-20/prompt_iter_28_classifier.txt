Given the pseudocode below, your task is to determine, **without executing or simulating**, whether the pseudocode is fully and unambiguously specified such that **any correct translation of it according to its specification will pass all unit tests exactly**.

Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode guarantees perfect reproducibility—that is, a faithful implementation passing every unit test without exception—and **0** otherwise.

To decide, rigorously verify that **all** of the following conditions hold strictly and completely:

---

### 1. **Complete Structural and Interface Definition**  
- All functions, procedures, methods, or classes are explicitly and uniquely named.  
- Every declared function’s input parameters (names, types, counts) and return values (types, meanings) are fully specified, precise, and match exactly the expected testing framework interface. No implicit assumptions on parameter naming, ordering, optionality, default values, or return semantics allowed.  
- All variables, constants, and data structures are explicitly declared or introduced with clear initialization or guaranteed valid initial states before use. Uninitialized or vaguely initialized entities cause failure.  
- The pseudocode’s overall structure (e.g., classes, function signatures, entry points) aligns perfectly with what the testing environment requires, including expected parameter names and data types.

### 2. **Algorithmic Determinism and Exhaustiveness**  
- Every control flow construct (loops, recursions, conditionals) is detailed with **explicit and unambiguous conditions**, exact loop bounds, and guaranteed termination proofs or provided exit conditions **covering all valid inputs**. No possibility of infinite loops or undefined iteration scenarios.  
- Each step in the computational process is fully described: operations, state transitions, side effects, and intermediate variables—all specified without dependence on external or unstated mechanics, language-specific quirks, or hidden state.  
- The algorithm completely addresses the problem scope it implies or states, with **no implicit gaps, missing steps, or undefined behaviors** anywhere.  
- All critical assumptions, invariants, preconditions, and postconditions affecting correctness must be **explicitly stated or unambiguously derivable** strictly from pseudocode content; nothing may be inferred beyond what is explicitly written.  
- If any instruction or condition admits multiple plausible interpretations or allows ambiguity, the reproducibility cannot be guaranteed and you must output `0`.

### 3. **Comprehensive Edge Case and Boundary Coverage**  
- The pseudocode must explicitly handle all problem-relevant edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, zero values, minimal/maximal sizes, invalid or special inputs), or clearly and unambiguously imply their correct handling without contradiction or omission.  
- Accesses to elements by index or position must have exact bounds and offsets defined, preventing any out-of-bound possibility or undefined memory/data access.  
- Exceptional and corner cases must be either explicitly addressed or explicitly stated as omitted with due rationale; silent or implicit handling that risks inconsistent or undefined behavior mandates output `0`.

### 4. **Implementation Independence and Full Determinism**  
- The pseudocode is fully self-contained, with no reliance on external/global variables, hidden state, or environment beyond the declared inputs and explicit outputs.  
- No use of randomness, non-deterministic operations, platform-dependent functionality, or unspecified ordering of operations is permitted.  
- The output for any fixed valid input is uniquely defined and reproducible strictly from the pseudocode steps given.

### 5. **Direct Implementability and Consistency with Test Harness**  
- The pseudocode is immediately translatable into a fully functional, standalone implementation without requiring any external scaffolding, undeclared helper functions, or supplemental libraries.  
- The interface format (function/class signatures, parameter names/types, and returns) maps exactly onto the standardized test harness expectations without adding or omitting any element.  
- The pseudocode does not omit any critical implementation detail that would force guesswork or require environment-specific fixes.

### Additional Evaluation Details & Decision Rules  
- Any **uncertainty** about variable initialization, function interface correctness, loop termination, or edge case handling requires output `0`.  
- Do *not* perform guessing or "common sense" in filling unspecified details. Judge strictly by explicit specifications only.  
- Contradictions, inconsistent logic, or ambiguous statements anywhere force output `0`.  
- If structural interface details contradict expected test interfaces (e.g., different parameter names or missing return values), output `0`.  
- Recursive or iterative flows without exact, provable termination conditions mandate output `0`.  
- Confirm all variables, operations, and data transformations are fully traceable and precise, including intermediate or auxiliary data.

---

**Output instructions:**  
- For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit (`1` or `0`) on a separate line, in the order the pseudocodes are provided, **with no extra text, formatting, or explanation**.  
- `1` means completely reproducible, guarantees passing all unit tests.  
- `0` means not reproducible due to any ambiguity, incompleteness, inconsistency, or unspecified behavior.

This prompt enforces a strict, all-encompassing reproducibility checklist emphasizing **explicitness, completeness, deterministic correctness, and exact interface alignment**—maximizing accuracy in distinguishing pseudocode that truly guarantees passing unit tests from those that do not.
