Given the pseudocode below, perform a meticulous, line-by-line static analysis **without running or simulating execution**, to determine whether it is fully specified, unambiguous, and logically correct to guarantee that **any faithful implementation derived strictly from this pseudocode will pass all unit tests for the described function**.

For your determination, rigorously address the following critical aspects:

1. **Complete and Clear Specification:**  
   - Are **all inputs, outputs, variables, data structures, and constants** clearly named and defined with their roles and types (explicit or clearly implied)?  
   - Are initial states and any required setup steps unambiguously specified?  
   - Are all function or method signatures, including parameters and return values, explicitly stated?  
   - Is the flow of control and data manipulation **fully detailed with no gaps, implicit steps, or undefined behaviors?**

2. **Logical Correctness and Algorithmic Soundness:**  
   - Does the pseudocode implement a **correct, well-founded algorithm** consistent with the problem’s intent?  
   - Are all operations, conditions, and updates **coherent, contradiction-free, and logically valid** throughout?  
   - Are calculations and state transitions clearly and correctly expressed?  

3. **Robust Termination and Edge Case Handling:**  
   - Are **all relevant edge cases and boundary conditions** explicitly considered and appropriately handled?  
   - Are all loops and recursion guaranteed to terminate for all valid input domains without risk of infinite iteration, deadlocks, or unresolved states?  
   - Are exceptional or special-case inputs addressed?  

4. **Deterministic and Implementation-Independent Behavior:**  
   - Does the pseudocode avoid reliance on unstated assumptions, external state, or "implementation details" that vary or require interpretation?  
   - Would **any practitioner strictly following this pseudocode produce identical outputs for the same inputs every time?**  
   - Is nondeterminism or use of probabilistic/stochastic elements clearly stated or absent?  

5. **Self-Containment and Consistent Naming:**  
   - Are **all referenced variables, functions, and helper procedures defined or explicitly declared prior to use?**    
   - Are naming conventions consistent, and references unambiguous throughout the pseudocode?  
   - Are any auxiliary elements (such as helper functions or data structures) fully spelled out or described?  

**Your output must be a single digit for each input pseudocode, corresponding exactly to the order they are provided:**

- Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode satisfies *all* the criteria above: completely specified, fully correct, unambiguous, terminating, and guaranteed reproducible—such that every faithful implementation would pass all unit tests.  
- Output **0** if *any* doubt, ambiguity, gap, logical error, or incompleteness exists that could cause a conforming implementation to fail some unit tests or behave inconsistently.

**STRICTLY output only the digit 1 or 0 per pseudocode input; do not provide explanations, comments, formatting, or any other text.**
