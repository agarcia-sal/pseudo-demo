Given the following pseudocode, analyze it for clarity, completeness, and correctness to determine if it can unambiguously pass all hidden unit tests for its intended functionality. Consider whether the logic is fully specified, all variables and control flows are well-defined, and there are no contradictions or missing steps that would prevent consistent reproduction of correct outputs. Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible (i.e., can pass all unit tests), otherwise output **0**.  
**Output only a single digit: 1 or 0.**
