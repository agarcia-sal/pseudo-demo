Given the pseudocode below, **without executing or simulating it, and relying solely on the explicit textual and structural details presented**, determine if it is fully and unambiguously specified such that **any correct implementation strictly following this pseudocode will pass all unit tests for the target problem without fail or inconsistency.**

Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets *all* of these stringent, explicit criteria, otherwise output **0**:

1. **Absolute Syntax and Signature Precision:**  
   - The pseudocode defines all functions, classes, or methods with unambiguous, exact names and parameters, including their expected input and output types or formats exactly matching the required testing interface.  
   - All variables, constants, and data structures are explicitly declared or clearly introduced with initial values or states wherever required; no use of undeclared identifiers or implicit initializations.  
   - Control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion) have completely specified iteration or recursion bounds, termination conditions, and all updates; no reliance on implicit or default behaviors.  
   - Operations (assignments, calculations, data manipulations) are defined with complete detail and no dependence on language-dependent behaviors or side effects.  
   - The entry point or callable entity corresponds exactly to those expected by the testing harness, with parameter names and order precise.

2. **Full Logical and Functional Completeness:**  
   - The pseudocode fully addresses the stated or strongly implied problem scope, leaving no logical gaps, contradictions, or steps omitted.  
   - All subdivisions of logic, including nested conditions and helper routines, are coherently and completely defined.  
   - Preconditions, invariants, and assumptions critical for correctness are either explicitly stated or unequivocally determinable from the pseudocode.  
   - Recursive and iterative processes demonstrate explicit, verifiable progress toward termination.

3. **Comprehensive Edge Case and Boundary Handling:**  
   - All relevant categories of inputs—including empty, minimal, maximal, or special/exceptional cases—are either explicitly handled or their correct handling is clearly implied and unambiguous.  
   - Termination of loops and recursion is explicitly and rigorously guaranteed to prevent infinite execution.

4. **Deterministic and Environment-Independent Specification:**  
   - The pseudocode’s behavior depends solely on its declared inputs without any hidden or external state, side effects, or non-deterministic elements.  
   - The logic guarantees the same output consistently given identical inputs, regardless of implementation details or runtime environment.

5. **Self-Containment, Implementability, and Test Compatibility:**  
   - The pseudocode is fully self-contained and implementable as presented, requiring no supplementary assumptions, external scaffolding, or hidden context.  
   - Public-facing functions or methods correspond exactly to callable units that automated unit tests will invoke without additional wrapping or adaptation.

**Additional explicit rules:**  
- Any form of ambiguity, vagueness, missing initializations, unspecified return values, or unclear flow control must result in outputting **0**.  
- Lack of exact match in function/method signatures against the test interface mandates output **0**.  
- Non-trivial control structures must have clear, explicit, and verifiable termination criteria.  
- Do not infer or guess any unspecified behavior; only explicit clear specifications count toward reproducibility.  
- Variable state changes and data flows must be fully traceable and unambiguous throughout the pseudocode.

**Output format:**  
- Produce exactly one digit per pseudocode input: **1** if all criteria above are comprehensively met ensuring guaranteed reproducibility; **0** otherwise.  
- Outputs must appear strictly in the same order as the pseudocodes are fed in.  
- Produce no explanations, no whitespace, no formatting—only the digit.

This prompt enforces maximal rigor, precision, and explicitness to reliably differentiate reproducible pseudocode from any under-specified or ambiguous variants, significantly improving accuracy especially on near-miss and cosmetic pseudocode cases.
