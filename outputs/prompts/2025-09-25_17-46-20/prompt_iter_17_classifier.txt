Given the pseudocode below, **without executing or simulating any code**, output **1** if and only if the pseudocode is fully precise, unambiguous, and complete to the degree that **any faithful implementation based solely on it will pass all unit tests without fail**, otherwise output **0**. Output must be exactly one character, either `1` or `0`, per pseudocode input, in the order given, with no additional text or formatting.

To decide between `1` (reproducible) and `0` (not reproducible), enforce and verify all the following strictly and holistically:

---

### 1. Complete and Explicit Interface Definition  
- The pseudocode **declares every top-level callable (function, method, procedure)** with:  
  - exact name(s), full input parameter lists including types or descriptive forms, and fully specified return values including types or formats.  
  - no ambiguity, omission, or implicit parameters/returns.  
  - alignment in names and interfaces with the testing harness or expected API (no deviations, aliases, or missing elements).  

- All classes, global data structures, or modules defined in pseudocode are fully declared, named, and match expected usage patterns.

### 2. Deterministic, Fully Specified Algorithmic Steps  
- Every computational element—variables, constants, data structures—is explicitly introduced, including types, valid initial values or states, and declaration scopes sufficient for unambiguous translation.  
- Control flow constructs (loops, recursion, conditionals, switches) are precisely bounded and defined, with explicit loop limits or recursion depth indications assuring guaranteed termination on **all valid input cases**.  
- Steps have no implied behavior: every operation, update, or condition uses fully detailed logic with no reliance on external defaults, language/platform/runtime-dependent side effects, or unspecified environmental states.  
- If multiple plausible interpretations or ambiguous conditions exist for any step—even subtleties like variable shadowing, indexing conventions, or numeric rounding—output `0`.  
- Algorithmic correctness conditions (preconditions, invariants, postconditions, error handling) must be clearly articulated or unequivocally derivable **without assumptions beyond the pseudocode itself**.

### 3. Exhaustive Handling of Inputs and Edge Cases  
- The pseudocode clearly specifies behavior for:  
  - edge cases such as empty inputs, single-element inputs, maximum/minimum input sizes, zero, null-equivalents, and invalid or special input variants if relevant.  
- Boundary conditions on indices, ranges, offsets, and data accesses are precisely defined to prevent any out-of-bounds or undefined behavior possibilities.  
- Exceptional scenarios or error states are either explicitly handled or explicitly documented as unsupported, never left silent or ambiguous.

### 4. Full Implementation Independence and Determinism  
- The pseudocode is self-contained: it does **not** rely on any external global or hidden state beyond what is explicitly passed in parameters or declared within.  
- No use of randomness, concurrency, unspecified ordering of evaluation, platform-dependent features, or nondeterministic constructs is permitted.  
- For any identical input, the pseudocode’s behavior and output must be fully deterministic and stable.

### 5. Direct, Complete Translational Clarity  
- The pseudocode must be directly and completely translatable into a fully functioning implementation **without any supplemental scaffolding, helper definitions, or assumptions** beyond what is provided.  
- Naming conventions, data and control flow structures, and modular decomposition must align seamlessly with typical unit test frameworks and their expectations.  
- No missing helper routines or unclear sections that would require external additions or guesswork.

---

### Additional rigorous operational guidelines for evaluation:  
- Treat **any uncertainty, implicitness, or undefinedness** in variable initialization, output specification, or control flow termination as a failure (`0`).  
- Confirm every single variable and data item usage is traceable from explicit initialization and modifications, and all intermediate states are unambiguous.  
- Recursive or iterative processes require explicit, verifiable exit conditions valid for all inputs to avoid infinite loops or stack overflow scenarios.  
- If the pseudocode lacks explicit class/method naming consistent with the test infrastructure or uses inconsistent parameter signatures or return types, output `0`.  
- Silent omissions, partial edge case coverage, ambiguous control flow instructions, or partial logical paths are grounds for `0`.  
- Avoid inferring any “common knowledge” or unstated domain-specific knowledge; rely strictly on what is articulated.

---

**Summary:** Output `1` **if and only if** the pseudocode is rigorously self-contained, unambiguous, fully complete, explicitly defined, and guaranteed to produce deterministic, correct results on all input cases tested by unit tests without requiring any external assumptions; otherwise output `0`.

**Output only one character per input (either `1` or `0`)—no explanations, formatting, or additional text.**  
The output order must exactly correspond to the input pseudocode order.

This methodology captures completeness, interface fidelity, determinism, edge case coverage, and implementability in one unified prompt, maximizing precise reproducibility detection and minimizing false positives/negatives, including subtle near-miss distinctions.
