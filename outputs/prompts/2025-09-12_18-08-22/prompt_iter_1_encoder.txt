Generate concise, easy-to-read, high-level pseudocode from the given problem description. Use mostly one-liners, symbolic notation, and abbreviations. The pseudocode must not include any purpose, summary, overview, or explanatory notes—only the pseudocode itself. Follow a clear step-by-step numbered format like:

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Keep it compact and natural language-like for clarity. Avoid comments or extra explanations. Aim to produce the best result within a 5-second timeout.
