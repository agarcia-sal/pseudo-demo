Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally identical but syntactically, structurally, and stylistically distinct version that meets all the following criteria:

- Preserve all original function names, class names, method signatures, class hierarchies, and overall object-oriented structure exactly as given; do not add, remove, or rename functions, classes, or parameters, nor alter their order or relationships.

- Maintain exact algorithmic behavior and logic, including data flow, operation semantics, and result, with no omissions or alterations in functionality.

- Transform all code constructs (loops, conditionals, assignments, expressions, data structures) using diverse idiomatic pseudocode alternatives, including but not limited to:
  - Converting loops between `for`, `while`, and recursion where applicable
  - Replacing inline expressions with explicit stepwise computations, or vice versa
  - Restructuring control flows such as conditionals using different branching forms or logical inversions
  - Utilizing alternative data representations, access patterns, or temporary variables to reorganize the computation without changing results
  - Changing variable naming styles consistently throughoutâ€”relabel all local variables (except function/class names) to new meaningful pseudonyms unrelated to original names
  - Alter formatting conventions (indentation, statement order in independent blocks, line breaks) to maximize syntactic difference but ensure unambiguous logic flow

- Do not introduce any new functions or classes, or remove existing ones, or modify class member structures.

- Avoid any comments, explanations, or output other than the rewritten pseudocode.

Produce only the fully rewritten pseudocode that can be clearly understood as correct, valid, and behaviorally equivalent to the original input. No introduction, summary, or extraneous text.
