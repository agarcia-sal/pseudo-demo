Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a fully functionally equivalent version that is as dissimilar as possible in syntax, style, and structure, while strictly preserving the original class names, function names (including parameters and their order), and the exact class hierarchy and object layouts.  
Specifically:  
- Transform all control flow elements (loops, conditionals, recursions, etc.) into alternative idiomatic pseudocode constructs (e.g., switch to for-loops if while-loops were used, replace nested conditionals with guard clauses, or vice versa).  
- Use different, consistent variable names unrelated to the originals (except do not rename any functions, classes, or their parameters).  
- Change data structure representations (for example, replace arrays with lists, maps with dictionaries, stacks with queues, or express collections in alternate pseudocode styles).  
- Reorder or decompose logic segments freely as long as behavior is unchanged; invert conditions where logically valid; replace inline expressions with multi-step equivalents or vice versa.  
- Apply distinct formatting and indentation styles to differentiate presentation.  
- Explicitly avoid introducing new functions, classes, or modifying the existing class structures or function signatures.  
- Do not include any comments, explanatory text, or annotationsâ€”output only the rewritten pseudocode.  
Ensure the output is a standalone, unambiguous pseudocode rendition that exactly replicates the original semantics and functionality, yet is syntactically and stylistically as different as possible, honoring all constraints regarding identifiers and structure.
