Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally equivalent version that uses fundamentally different control flow, data structures, variable naming, and formatting conventions, while strictly preserving all original function names, class names, and the exact class hierarchy. Transform all constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, assignments) into alternative but correct idiomatic pseudocode expressions, reorder or restructure logic where possible without altering semantics, and replace any inline expressions with explicit steps or vice versa. Do not add comments, explanations, or external text; output only the rewritten pseudocode that can be unambiguously understood as valid and fully equivalent in behavior to the original. Maintain all original identifiers for functions and classes exactly as given, including parameters and their order, and never introduce new functions, classes, or change the structure of classes and objects.
