Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally identical version that differs from the original as extensively as possible at every syntactic and stylistic level, while **strictly preserving all class names, function names, and their exact signatures as well as the complete class and object hierarchy** (including nesting and encapsulation). Your rewritten pseudocode should:

- Retain all class and function definitions with precisely the same names, parameters (names, order, and types), and nesting structure—do not add, remove, reorder, or merge/split classes or functions.

- Freely transform every other aspect of the pseudocode, including but not limited to:
  - Replace control flow constructs with alternatives performing the same logic (e.g., convert `for` to `while`, use recursion instead of loops, expand or compress conditional expressions, swap `if-else` chains with guards or `switch`-like constructs).
  - Alter iteration styles and indexing approaches (e.g., iterate by index, by element, reverse iteration order).
  - Rename all variable identifiers except class and function names (including loop counters, temporary variables, parameters local to functions) to completely unrelated names without any lexical resemblance to original identifiers.
  - Reformat code extensively: change indentation, spacing, line breaks, and pseudocode keywords — swap keywords with equivalent descriptive phrases (e.g., `SET X TO Y` ↔ `ASSIGN Y TO X`, `IF condition THEN` ↔ `WHEN condition:`).
  - Rewrite all expressions—arithmetic, logical, relational—into equivalent but differently structured expressions (e.g., replace `a > b` with `NOT (a <= b)`).
  - Reorder statements or combine/split expressions as long as semantic meaning is preserved.
  - Substitute data structure types for semantically equivalent alternatives when applicable (e.g., list vs array vs sequence; map vs dictionary vs associative array).
  - Avoid adding, removing, or changing comments; output only pseudocode — no commentary or explanation of any kind.

- Ensure that the rewritten pseudocode is clean, readable, unambiguous, and can be mentally verified by a competent reader to be functionally identical to the original despite maximal syntactic dissimilarity.

**Only produce the rewritten pseudocode as output—do not provide any explanation, notes, or additional text.**
