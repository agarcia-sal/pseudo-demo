Rewrite the given pseudocode into a semantically identical pseudocode version that preserves full original functionality but exhibits maximal syntactic and stylistic divergence. Follow these instructions precisely:

- **Strictly retain all class names, function names, and method signatures exactly as in the original pseudocode**, including parameter names, parameter order, return types, and the full class/object nesting and hierarchy. No additions, removals, or reorderings of classes or functions are allowed.

- Except for these immutable identifiers and structure, you have unrestricted liberty to transform *every other aspect* of the pseudocode, including but not limited to:

  - Rework control flow constructs: convert between loop types (`for`, `while`, recursion), refactor conditional branching structures (e.g., replace `if-else` chains by `switch` statements or guard clauses), flatten or nest conditions differently, reorganize short-circuit logic.

  - Change traversal and iteration style: index-based loops ↔ element-based loops, use different loop variables, reorder independent iterations where safe.

  - Rename **all local variables, temporary variables, and loop counters** to completely new, unrelated names with no lexical overlap or root similarity to originals.

  - Change formatting drastically: modify indentation, insert or remove line breaks, use synonyms or descriptive phrase substitutions for pseudocode keywords (e.g., `SET X TO Y` ↔ `ASSIGN Y TO X` or `INCREMENT VAR BY 1` ↔ `VAR ← VAR + 1`), and vary punctuation styles where allowed.

  - Decompose or consolidate complex expressions using intermediate variables, reorder independent operations, rearrange logically independent code blocks, refactor boolean expressions via inversion, De Morgan’s laws, or equivalent rewrites—preserving exact truth conditions.

  - Swap between semantically equivalent data structure representations where appropriate (e.g., arrays ↔ lists, tuples ↔ pairs), and rewrite indexing and access expressions accordingly.

  - Rewrite arithmetic, logical, comparison, and indexing expressions in alternate yet equivalent forms (e.g., `a ≤ b` ↔ `¬(a > b)`, `x + 0` ↔ `x`, `len - 1` ↔ `last index`, etc.).

- Do **not** add, remove or change any comments, annotations, docstrings, or explanatory text; output only the transformed pseudocode itself.

- The output must be fully clear, unambiguous, syntactically valid for the pseudocode domain, and maintain the same computational logic as the original.

- Emphasize a rewrite that a domain expert can immediately recognize as fully functionally equivalent yet substantially novel in style, structure, and lexical content aside from the preserved class/function names and hierarchy.

- Output **only** the rewritten pseudocode; do not provide any explanations, summaries, or additional text before or after.

This prompt is designed for robust and diverse rewriting of pseudocode with strict preservation of externally visible APIs and structures, maximizing internal code rewrite depth and variability while guaranteeing correctness.
