Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that is fully functionally identical but syntactically and stylistically maximally divergent. This rewritten pseudocode must strictly **preserve all class names, function names, their signatures (parameters and order), and the exact class and method nesting and encapsulation hierarchy** without any addition, removal, or reordering of classes or functions.

Outside these constraints, you may freely and thoroughly transform the pseudocode with the goal of maximal syntactic and stylistic difference while maintaining perfect semantic equivalence and readability. This includes **(but is not limited to)**:

- Replacing all local variable, temporary, and loop variable names with completely unrelated names that share no substring or semantic similarity to originals.
- Converting control flow forms freely among all semantically equivalent constructs (e.g., `for` ↔ `while` loops; recursion ↔ iteration; conditionals ↔ guard clauses, `switch` statements, or nested conditionals; unfold, fold, invert, or extend boolean conditions).
- Splitting or combining expressions using intermediate variables or inline expansions; reordering operations and independent code blocks; reformulating logic via equivalent boolean algebra transformations.
- Swapping equivalent data structures (e.g., arrays ↔ lists; pairs ↔ tuples) wherever semantics allow.
- Employing synonyms or descriptive phrases to replace standard pseudocode keywords or common idioms, ensuring clarity and no ambiguity.
- Modifying formatting conventions (indentation, line breaks, spacing) and phrasing for all statements to appear stylistically distinct.
- Expressing arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions in alternate, equivalent formulations without changing logic.
- Avoid introducing or removing any comments, explanations, or annotations: output only the pseudocode itself.

The output should be clearly formatted and unambiguous, such that a proficient reader can confirm the exact same logic and behavior, yet immediately recognize the rewrite as substantially different in every syntactic and stylistic aspect except for the **fixed class and function identifiers and their hierarchical arrangement**.

**Only output the rewritten pseudocode—nothing else. No explanations or commentary.**
