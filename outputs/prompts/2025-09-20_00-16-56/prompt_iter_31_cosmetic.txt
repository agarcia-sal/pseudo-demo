Rewrite the given pseudocode into a fully functionally identical version that maximally differs from the original in every syntactic, stylistic, and structural aspect, *except* that:

- All **class names**, **function names**, and **method signatures** (including exact parameter names, order, and types) must remain exactly as in the original, preserving classes, functions, and their nested encapsulation without any addition, removal, or reordering.

- You must retain the original **class and object hierarchy** *precisely* as given.

Beyond these constraints, apply all possible transformations for maximal divergence while preserving exact semantic behavior:

1. **Control Flow Reengineering:**  
   - Replace loop types (e.g., transform `for` loops into equivalent `while` or recursive constructs, or vice versa).  
   - Flatten or expand nested conditionals; invert or combine boolean expressions logically without changing their meaning.  
   - Apply guard clauses instead of nested `if-else` chains where appropriate, or use switch/case equivalents if applicable.

2. **Variable Renaming:**  
   - Rename *all* local variables, loop counters, temporary variables, and intermediate identifiers to new, unrelated names with no lexical or semantic similarity to originals.  
   - Keep parameter and class/function identifiers untouched.

3. **Data Structure Alteration:**  
   - Substitute data structures with equivalent types (e.g., array ↔ list, tuple ↔ pair), maintaining identical data semantics.  
   - Rearrange or combine expressions using intermediate variables differently.

4. **Expression Transformation:**  
   - Rewrite arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions into equivalent but syntactically different forms (e.g., use alternate arithmetic identities, De Morgan’s laws, distributive transformations).  
   - Reorder independent operations or logically independent code blocks where it does not affect semantics.

5. **Formatting and Keyword Diversity:**  
   - Change all formatting, indentation, and pseudocode phrasing. For example, vary pseudocode keyword usages by replacing `SET X TO Y` with `ASSIGN Y TO X`, or use descriptive phrases in place of keywords.  
   - Do not add or remove comments or annotations; output only pure pseudocode without explanations.

6. **Iteration and Traversal Styles:**  
   - Alter iteration styles: for example, iterate by index instead of element, or vice versa.  
   - Use different looping boundaries or step increments if logically permissible.

7. **Function and Class Structure:**  
   - Do *not* introduce new functions or classes; do *not* remove or reorder existing ones.  
   - Inner functions must remain nested as they were.

**Output Requirement:**  
Your output must be solely the rewritten pseudocode — no extra commentary or explanation — and it must be clear, readable, and unambiguously equivalent in functionality to the original. The rewritten pseudocode should be immediately recognizable as a distinct variant by a knowledgeable reader due to its comprehensive syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence from the input, *except* for the fixed function and class identifiers and their organization.

**Reminder:**  
- Preserve **class names**  
- Preserve **function names** and **method signatures** (parameters as-is)  
- Preserve **class and object hierarchy** and nesting  
- Change everything else for maximal difference  
- Output only the rewritten pseudocode, no additional text or commentary
