Rewrite the given pseudocode into a fully functionally equivalent version that differs as much as possible in every syntactic and stylistic aspect—except for the identifiers of classes and functions which must remain exactly as in the original along with their hierarchical and encapsulation structure. Your output must adhere to these strict requirements:

1. **Preserve exactly** all:
   - Class names.
   - Function and method names, along with their full signatures (parameter names, order, and types).
   - The encapsulating class and object nesting structure (i.e., where functions or classes appear inside others).

2. For everything else, you have **maximum liberty** to transform the pseudocode, including but not limited to:
   - Replace control flow constructs with equivalent alternatives (e.g., substitute `for` loops with `while` loops, recursion, or different iteration patterns).
   - Change iteration and indexing styles (e.g., element-focused iteration instead of index-based or vice versa).
   - Rename every local variable, temporary identifier, and loop counter to completely unrelated names that share no derivational similarity with original names.
   - Alter all formatting, spacing, indentation, and pseudocode keywords or phrasing—use varied expressions for assignments, conditions, loop constructs, and other statements (e.g., `SET X TO Y` ↔ `ASSIGN Y TO X` ↔ `X := Y`).
   - Restructure expressions, breaking down or merging arithmetic/logical parts, reorder independent instructions and blocks without affecting logic, invert or rewrite boolean conditions with logically equivalent forms.
   - Swap data structure types for semantically identical alternatives when possible (e.g., array ↔ list, tuple ↔ pair).
   - Reformulate any numeric, logical, or comparison expressions into alternative but equivalent forms.
   - Change how constants or magic numbers are assigned or represented using equivalent expressions.

3. Do **not** add, remove, or reorder any classes or functions. Do not alter method signatures or the class hierarchy.

4. Output **only** the rewritten pseudocode—no additional explanations, annotations, comments, or text.

5. Ensure the output is clearly readable, unambiguous, and maintains perfect semantic equivalence with the original.

The goal is a pseudocode rewriting that a knowledgeable reader can verify as semantically identical to the original, yet is substantially distinct in every other syntactic and stylistic measure, while strictly preserving all class/function identifiers and structure exactly as they appear in the input.

Only output the rewritten pseudocode—no explanations or extra text.
