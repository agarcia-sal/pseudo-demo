Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally equivalent version that is maximally distinct in style and structure from the original, while strictly preserving the original class names, function names, method signatures (including parameter names and order), and the exact class and object hierarchy. Your output must conform to these requirements:

- Do not add, remove, or alter any classes, functions, methods, or their signatures, including parameter names and their order. Maintain all class relationships and nesting exactly as in the input.

- Freely transform every other detail to achieve maximal syntactic, stylistic, and structural divergence from the original pseudocode. This includes but is not limited to:
  * Replacing all local variable and temporary identifier names with new, unrelated, and unique names.
  * Reorganizing control flow dramatically: convert loops to recursion or alternate loop types; reshape conditional logic into guard clauses, switch/case constructs, or merged/unfolded conditionals.
  * Changing data structure usage where semantically safe: swap arrays, lists, maps, or sets when possible; use different iteration styles or indexing approaches.
  * Altering expression forms by introducing intermediate variables or merging multiple steps into composite expressions, toggling between explicit and implicit computations.
  * Permuting independent code statements and logic blocks to new orders without changing program behavior.
  * Using alternative pseudocode keywords, syntactic forms, phrasing, and formatting conventions — including indentation, spacing, line breaks, and keyword styles — to maximize difference.
  
- Do not introduce any comments, metadata, explanations, or non-pseudocode text. The output must be purely pseudocode.

- Ensure the resulting pseudocode remains unambiguous, clear, syntactically valid, and faithfully embodies all the logic and behavior of the original input.

The final output should be solely the rewritten pseudocode fulfilling the above criteria. A reader with knowledge of the original would recognize the exact functional equivalence, even though the structure, style, and syntax are extensively and systematically transformed.
