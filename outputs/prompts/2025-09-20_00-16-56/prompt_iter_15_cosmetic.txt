Rewrite the given pseudocode into a semantically identical but structurally and stylistically transformed version. Your rewrite must adhere to these strict requirements:

- Preserve all original class names, function names, method signatures (including parameter names and order), and the entire class and object hierarchy exactly as in the input.  
- Do not introduce any new classes, functions, or change the class structure or relationships.  
- Modify all other aspects freely to maximize syntactic and stylistic difference, including but not limited to:  
  * Control flow transformations (e.g., convert loops to recursion or different loop constructs, replace if-else chains with switch/case or guard clauses, unfold or fold conditional expressions).  
  * Data structure changes within allowed scope (e.g., replace arrays with lists or maps where it makes no semantic difference, use different iteration methods).  
  * Rename all local variables, loop counters, and temporary identifiers to new unique names unrelated to the originals.  
  * Change all formatting and indentation styles. Use alternate pseudocode keywords or phrasing while preserving meaning.  
  * Transform expressions by introducing intermediate steps or merging steps, toggling between explicit and implicit computation forms.  
  * Rearrange independent statements and reorder non-dependent logic blocks when possible without affecting program behavior.  
- Do not add any explanatory comments, metadata, or external text â€” the output must consist solely of the transformed pseudocode.  
- Ensure the output remains clearly legible and unambiguously valid as pseudocode representing the original logic and behavior in full.

Your final output is only this rewritten pseudocode that a knowledgeable reader would recognize as functionally identical to the input but stylistically and syntactically very different at every level except class and function identifiers which must remain exactly the same and in place.
