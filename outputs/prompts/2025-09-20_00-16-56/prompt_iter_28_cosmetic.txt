Rewrite the input pseudocode into a new version that is fully functionally equivalent but syntactically and stylistically as different as possible from the input. Your output **must** satisfy these strict rules:

1. **Preserve exactly all class names, function names, and function/method signatures (including parameter names, their order, and types) without any change.** The original class and object hierarchy, as well as their nesting and encapsulation, must be exactly maintained, with no additions, removals, or reorderings of classes or functions.

2. Apart from the above, you have *full freedom* to rewrite everything else radically differently, including but not limited to:  
   - Control flow changes (e.g., convert `for` loops to equivalent `while` loops or recursion, alter conditional structures by using inverted logic, guard clauses, or `switch`-style constructs).  
   - Iteration style transformations (index-based to element-based, or vice versa; change increment/decrement styles).  
   - Rename all local variables, temporary variables, and loop counters to new, unrelated names with no lexical or semantic similarity to originals.  
   - Restructure expressions: introduce or remove intermediate variables, reorder independent statements, split or merge expressions, rewrite logical/arithmetic/comparison expressions into mathematically or logically equivalent but syntactically distinct forms.  
   - Substitute data structure types for semantically identical alternatives where appropriate (e.g., list ↔ array, map ↔ dictionary, tuple ↔ pair).  
   - Replace pseudocode keywords or phrasing with synonyms, alternate descriptive phrases, or idiomatic equivalents (e.g., `SET X TO Y` ⇄ `ASSIGN Y TO X`, `IF`/`ELSE IF`/`ELSE` reordered into guard clauses or nested conditionals).  
   - Modify formatting, indentation, line breaks, and use alternative keyword styles to improve readability while changing style.  

3. **Do not add, remove, or modify any comments or explanatory text. Output only pseudocode, no other text or annotations.**

4. The output pseudocode must be clean, well-formed, unambiguous, and readily understandable as functionally identical by an expert but obviously stylistically distant from the original.

5. The goal is maximal syntactic and stylistic divergence while maintaining perfect semantic equivalence, with exactly the same class/function structure and identifiers.

**Only output the rewritten pseudocode—no explanations, examples, or additional text.**
