Rewrite the input pseudocode into a functionally identical yet syntactically and structurally transformed version that differs maximally from the original in all aspects except those explicitly fixed. Specifically:

- Preserve exactly all **function names**, **class names**, **parameter names and their order**, and **the class hierarchy and object structures** without any modification or additions.

- Change all control flow constructs (loops, conditionals, recursion) to alternative equivalent idioms or styles; for example, convert `for` loops to `while` loops or vice versa, replace inline conditionals with expanded `if-else` blocks or switch statements, unroll or abstract assignments, and invert or restructure logic branches where semantics are preserved.

- Substitute all variable names (excluding fixed function and class names and parameters) consistently with new, unrelated identifiers to eliminate lexical similarity.

- Replace data structures with different but behaviorally equivalent constructs appropriate to the pseudocode domain (e.g., arrays ⇄ lists, maps ⇄ dictionaries), reordering elements or grouping data differently where possible without altering correctness.

- Alter formatting conventions and presentation style, including indentation style, line breaks, ordering of logically independent statements, and expression grouping, ensuring the output remains unambiguous and readable pseudocode.

- Transform all expressions: replace inline expressions with multi-step explicit calculations and vice versa; use alternative arithmetic and logical formulations that are semantically equivalent.

- Do not add any new functions, classes, or modify existing ones structurally; do not add comments or explanatory text; output solely the rewritten pseudocode, fully self-contained and immediately understandable as a valid, equivalent alternative to the original.

The output must be **only** the rewritten pseudocode as specified, without any prefatory or supplementary text.
