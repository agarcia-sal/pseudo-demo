Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a semantically equivalent version that preserves exactly the same functionality but differs from the original as much as possible in terms of syntax, control flow, variable naming, expressions, and overall stylistic choices.  
- Retain all original function names intact.  
- Retain all original class names and preserve the existing class and object hierarchy exactly as given.  
- You must not add or remove any functions, classes, parameters, or change their signatures.  
- You may reorder or restructure code blocks, change loop types, use alternative conditional forms, rename local variables, replace literals with equivalent expressions, and rewrite logic in a different style as long as behavior is unchanged.  
- Do not include any comments, explanations, or extra text; output only the full rewritten pseudocode.  
- Avoid simply replacing keywords with synonyms or applying trivial textual variations; instead, aim for deep structural and stylistic transformation to maximize difference while preserving correctness.
