Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that is functionally identical yet as syntactically and stylistically distinct as possible, strictly following these constraints:

- Preserve all class names, function names, method signatures (including parameter names, order, and types), and the complete original class and object structure exactly, without adding, removing, or reordering classes or functions. Do not modify encapsulation or nesting levels.

- You have unlimited freedom to transform everything else, including but not limited to:

  * Alter all control flow constructs: convert between loops (`for` ↔ `while` ↔ recursion), conditionals (`if-else`, `switch/case`, guard clauses), and break/continue usage.

  * Change iteration styles: iterate by index, by element, with different loops, or recursion.

  * Rename every local variable, loop index, and temporary symbol to entirely unrelated, semantically neutral names without any resemblance to the originals.

  * Rewrite expressions: break down or combine arithmetic/boolean operations differently, reorder independent statements or blocks, invert or extend boolean logic preserving truth values.

  * Replace data structures with semantically equivalent alternatives where feasible (e.g., arrays ↔ lists, maps ↔ dictionaries, tuples ↔ pairs).

  * Modify formatting extensively: indentation style, line breaks, keywords phrasing, synonyms for assignments (`SET X TO Y` ↔ `ASSIGN Y TO X`), conditionals, loops, and other pseudocode syntax.

- NEVER add, remove, or reorder any comments or explanatory text; the output must contain only pseudocode.

- The output must be well-formed, unambiguous, and clearly map to the exact original logic and functionality.

- The goal is that any knowledgeable reader can confirm exact equivalence in behavior, while recognizing the rewrite as thoroughly different from the original on every syntactic and stylistic axis except names and structure of classes/functions.

- Output only the transformed pseudocode—no additional text or explanation.

This prompt is designed to maximize semantic preservation combined with maximal syntactic and stylistic novelty in the rewritten pseudocode.
