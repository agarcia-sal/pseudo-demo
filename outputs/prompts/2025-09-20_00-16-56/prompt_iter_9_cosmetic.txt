Rewrite the provided pseudocode to produce a version that is functionally identical but differs maximally in syntax, structure, and expression, while strictly preserving all original function names, class names, class hierarchies, method signatures, and parameter orders exactly as given. 

Specifically:

- Retain all classes and methods with their exact names and hierarchy, without adding, removing, or altering any classes, methods, or their signatures.
- Transform every control flow statement (e.g., for, while, if, switch/case) into an alternative, semantically equivalent construct—this may include converting loops to recursion or vice versa, replacing conditional chains with guard clauses, pattern matching, or other idiomatic pseudocode forms.
- Re-express expressions by expanding or contracting inline operations into explicit steps or merging them, altering arithmetic or logical operations to equivalent formulations, or restructuring complex conditions into simpler or differently grouped conditions.
- Change iteration order or approach where it does not affect program behavior, such as using different traversal methods or data access patterns.
- Replace all variable names with semantically neutral, distinct alternatives unrelated to the original names, but do NOT rename or alter function or class identifiers.
- Replace or refactor data structures with alternative, functionally equivalent ones (e.g., arrays ↔ lists, stacks ↔ queues where order usage permits), and rewrite data access accordingly.
- Modify formatting, indentation style, statement ordering within permissible reorderings, and grouping to yield a substantially different visual and structural presentation.
- Eliminate or exclude any comments, notes, or explanatory text; output ONLY the rewritten pseudocode.

Your output must be a legible, unambiguous pseudocode that preserves the exact behavior of the input yet differs as much as possible in surface form, control flow and naming from the original pseudocode, respecting all constraints above. Do NOT add or remove any class, method, or function signatures or alter their parameters. Output nothing else besides this rewritten pseudocode.
