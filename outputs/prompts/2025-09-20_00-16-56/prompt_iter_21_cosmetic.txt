Rewrite the given pseudocode into a new version that is fully functionally equivalent but as syntactically and stylistically distinct as possible. Follow these strict constraints and guidelines:

- **Retain exactly all original class names, function names, and method signatures without any change whatsoever** (including parameter names, types, order), and preserve all classes and functions in the same hierarchy, order, and encapsulation as in the input pseudocode.

- **You may transform all other elements freely, including but not limited to:**

  - Recast all control flow constructs (for, while, repeat-until, if-else, switch-case, recursion, short-circuit logic) into alternate but logically equivalent forms.

  - Rename all local variables, loop indices, temporary identifiers, and internal constants to completely unrelated names (avoid any root or substring overlap with originals).

  - Rephrase all statements using synonyms or descriptive phrases instead of original pseudocode keywords (e.g., `SET X TO Y` can be transformed into `ASSIGN Y TO X` or `INITIALIZE X WITH Y`).

  - Alter data structures to semantically equivalent ones whenever possible (e.g., array ↔ list, set ↔ collection, tuple ↔ pair), preserving usage semantics.

  - Break down or merge expressions, reorder independent operations or blocks, invert boolean expressions, distribute or factor logical operators, and rewrite arithmetic or comparison expressions into alternative but equivalent formulations.

  - Modify formatting, indentation style, and statement grouping freely for improved distinction, ensuring clarity and readability.

- **Do not add, remove, or alter any comments, metadata, or explanatory text. The output must be pure pseudocode only.**

- **Guarantee that the rewritten pseudocode can be interpreted by an expert as exactly implementing the original logic, with no loss or change in functionality despite maximal syntactic and stylistic divergence.**

- **Output only the transformed pseudocode. Do not include any explanation, preamble, or additional textual content.**

This procedure aims to produce a rewritten pseudocode that a knowledgeable reader can verify as functionally identical but immediately recognize as an independent, substantially different formulation—except for the fixed class and function structures which remain exactly as provided.
