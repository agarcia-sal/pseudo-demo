Rewrite the input pseudocode into a fully functionally identical alternative version that differs maximally from it in every syntactic, stylistic, and structural aspect—except for **all class names**, **function names**, and their exact **method signatures** (including parameter names, order, and types) as well as the **class and object hierarchy**, which must be preserved absolutely without any changes, additions, or removals.

To achieve maximal difference, apply *systematic, comprehensive* transformations including but not limited to:

- Reconstruct all control flow elements: convert loops into different loop constructs (e.g., `for` ↔ `while`), rewrite conditionals using different logical formulations (e.g., guard clauses, nested `if`s, switch/case abstractions, Boolean algebra rewrites), invert logic conditions where safe, reorder independent code blocks and statements, and restructure recursion vs iteration where applicable.

- Rename every local, temporary, and loop variable to names utterly dissimilar in length, character composition, and semantic roots; all new identifiers must share no substring or stem with originals; avoid reuse of names except for parameters.

- Substitute data structures and types with semantically equivalent alternatives whenever feasible (e.g., lists ↔ arrays, tuples ↔ pairs), reorganize data initialization, and refactor expressions by introducing or removing intermediate variables.

- Rewrite all expressions and computations into logically identical but syntactically different forms—including arithmetic, relational, and logical expressions—making use of equivalent identities, expanded or factored expressions, or alternative but correct formulations.

- Change keyword phrasings arbitrarily by using synonyms or descriptive paraphrases (e.g., `SET X TO Y` ↔ `ASSIGN Y TO X`, `INCREMENT` ↔ `ADD ONE TO`, `RETURN` ↔ `YIELD` if contextually appropriate), and alter formatting, whitespace, and indentation patterns to remove surface-level stylistic similarity.

- Do not introduce or remove any comments, explanations, or textual annotations; the output must consist strictly of the rewritten pseudocode source code alone.

- Preserve the input’s logical flow and side effects exactly so that the output pseudocode, when interpreted or implemented, produces identical behavior and results in all cases.

- Maintain all class and function encapsulation boundaries without any alteration to nesting or ordering.

Output **only** the transformed pseudocode with no accompanying commentary, preamble, or explanation. The rewritten code should be clearly legible and unambiguous, allowing a reader versed in programming and the problem domain to verify both fidelity and maximal divergence from the original style and layout.
