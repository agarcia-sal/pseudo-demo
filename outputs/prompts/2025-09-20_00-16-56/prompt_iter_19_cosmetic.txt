Rewrite the input pseudocode into a semantically identical version that preserves every class name, function name, method signature (including parameter names, order, and types), and maintains the original class and object hierarchy *unchanged*. Do **not** add, remove, or reorder any classes or functions, and keep their nesting exactly as in the input.

Beyond these constraints, transform the pseudocode as radically as possible to maximize syntactic and stylistic divergence while keeping the same precise logic and behavior. Your transformations may include but are not limited to:

- Converting loops (`for`, `while`) into different loop forms or recursion.
- Restructuring all control flow: replace `if-else` with guard clauses, early returns, nested conditionals, or switch/case where applicable; invert conditions logically without changing semantics.
- Renaming **all local variables, loop indices, temporary variables, and parameters** to arbitrary unrelated names with no linguistic similarity to originals.
- Rephrasing assignments and operations using synonyms or descriptive phrases instead of keywords (e.g., `SET A TO B` ↔ `ASSIGN B INTO A`, `INCREMENT i BY 1` ↔ `ADD 1 TO i`).
- Decomposing or merging expressions; introducing intermediate variables; regrouping or reordering independent statements.
- Swapping equivalent data structures (e.g., array ↔ list, tuple ↔ pair) where semantics are preserved.
- Reformulating all arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions into equivalent but non-identical forms (e.g., `a == b` ↔ `NOT (a != b)`).
- Modifying formatting, indentation style, and pseudocode keywords while ensuring clarity and unambiguous readability.
- Avoid adding or removing comments, explanations, or annotations in the output.
- The output must consist **solely** of the rewritten pseudocode, with no additional commentary or text.

The intended outcome is a highly distinct version of the original pseudocode that a knowledgeable reader can verify as functionally equivalent solely by understanding the preserved structure and identifiers, yet that differs widely at every other syntactic and stylistic level.

**Output only the rewritten pseudocode.**
