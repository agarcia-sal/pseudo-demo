Rewrite the given pseudocode into a semantically identical version that preserves **all class names**, **function names**, **method signatures** (including parameter names, their order and types), and the **class/object hierarchy exactly as in the original**, with no additions, removals, or reorderings of classes or functions.

Apart from these fixed identifiers and structural constraints, transform **everything else** to maximize syntactic and stylistic difference. Your rewrite must adhere to the following comprehensive guidelines:

1. **Control Flow**  
 - Convert loops into alternative forms wherever possible (e.g., `for` ↔ `while` ↔ recursion).  
 - Restructure conditionals: replace `if-else` chains with `switch/case`, guard clauses, or nested conditionals inverted logically.  
 - Reorder independent statements or blocks without changing program logic.

2. **Identifiers**  
 - Rename all local variables, loop indices, temporary variables, and any identifiers other than class/function names and parameter names.  
 - New names must bear no visual or morphological resemblance to the originals.

3. **Expressions and Operations**  
 - Rewrite arithmetic, boolean, comparison expressions into logically equivalent but structurally distinct forms (e.g., replace `a + b` with `b + a`, expand or factor expressions, change `!(condition)` to equivalent logic).  
 - Break down compound expressions into multiple smaller statements using intermediate variables, or combine simple statements into compound expressions when appropriate.

4. **Data Structures and Types**  
 - Replace data structures with semantically equivalent alternatives where possible (e.g., array ↔ list, tuple ↔ pair), maintaining required functionality.  
 - Use alternative idioms for indexing, slicing, and accessing collections without altering semantics.

5. **Formatting and Style**  
 - Alter keyword phrasing, using synonyms or descriptive alternatives (e.g., `ASSIGN x TO y` ↔ `SET x AS y` ↔ `x ← y`).  
 - Vary indentation, line breaks, and grouping for clarity and distinctiveness.  
 - Output must remain clean, well-structured, and fully readable in traditional pseudocode style.

6. **Comments and Text**  
 - Do not add, remove, or modify comments, annotations, or any explanatory text; output must consist solely of the transformed pseudocode.

7. **Integrity Constraints**  
 - Maintain exact class and function names, as well as the order and nesting of classes and functions, without modification.  
 - Keep method signatures (parameter names, order, and types) unchanged to preserve interface consistency.

The goal is a rewritten pseudocode that a knowledgeable reader can verify is functionally identical while recognizing it as dramatically different at every other syntactic and stylistic level. The output must be only the rewritten pseudocode—no additional explanations, notes, or metadata.

**Output only the rewritten pseudocode.**
