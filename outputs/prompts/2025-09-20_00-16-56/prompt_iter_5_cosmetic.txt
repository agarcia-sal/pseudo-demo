Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a fully equivalent but maximally different variant that preserves all original function names, class names, and the exact class and object structures without any modification to them. Produce only pseudocodeâ€”no comments, explanations, or any text beyond the rewritten code. Transform every element of the original pseudocode by systematically applying at least these forms of variation where applicable:

- Replace all control structures with alternative, semantically identical constructs (e.g., switch to different loop types, invert conditionals, use recursive logic instead of iteration or vice versa).
- Change all variable and parameter names consistently but differently, except function and class identifiers which must remain exactly the same.
- Substitute data structures with alternative, functionally equivalent types or representations (e.g., arrays instead of lists, maps instead of dictionaries, stacks instead of queues).
- Alter expression styles (e.g., expand inline expressions into stepwise statements, or condense multi-step logic into expressions).
- Reorder independent operations and restructure nested logic while preserving original semantics and order of effects.
- Change formatting conventions thoroughly: indentation style, line breaks, use of explicit vs implicit assignments or declarations.
- Avoid introducing any new functions, classes, methods, or changing the signature, visibility, or hierarchy of existing ones.
- Maintain precisely the original function signatures, parameter names, and their sequences.
- Produce pseudocode that can be unambiguously interpreted as valid and functionally identical to the input.

Output only the rewritten pseudocode reflecting the above transformations.
