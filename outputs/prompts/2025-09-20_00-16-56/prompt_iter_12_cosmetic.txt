Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally identical version that preserves **all class names, function names, method signatures, and the exact class and object hierarchy without introducing or removing any classes or functions**. Your output must be solely the rewritten pseudocode—no comments, explanations, or any text outside the code.

Your rewriting should aim to maximize structural and stylistic difference while guaranteeing perfect semantic equivalence. To achieve this:

- Completely transform control flow constructs (for, while, if-else, switch/case) into alternative logic forms (e.g., replace for-loops with while-loops or recursion, convert if-else chains into guard clauses or switch statements, and vice versa).
- Reorganize or reorder logically independent code blocks and statements wherever possible without changing behavior or output.
- Change data structures to alternative valid forms that support the same operations (e.g., lists ↔ arrays, maps ↔ dictionaries), or express collections using different idioms, without altering semantics.
- Rename all local variables and loop counters systematically to distinct but meaningful placeholders different from the originals; however, **do not rename functions, classes, methods, or parameters** (parameters must keep names and order).
- Replace inline expressions with decomposed multi-step assignments or inline operations, and vice versa, wherever feasible, to alter the pseudocode’s expression style.
- Alter formatting conventions throughout, including indentation style, statement delimiters, and expression syntax, while maintaining clear, unambiguous pseudocode semantics.
- Avoid adding or removing any code beyond these transformations—preserve the exact functional logic, including initialization, state updates, final returned results, and side effects.
- Do not insert comments, print statements, or debugging info.
- Do not invent new helper functions or classes that were not originally present, nor remove existing ones.
- Retain all original method signatures exactly, including parameter types (if provided).

Your output must be valid pseudocode that can be unambiguously understood to implement the original program logic in a markedly different syntactic and structural style, preserving **100%** identical functionality and behavior.
