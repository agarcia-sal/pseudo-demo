Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally identical version that exhibits maximal structural and stylistic difference from the original, while strictly preserving all function names, class names, class hierarchies, and parameter lists exactly as given. Your transformation must include, but is not limited to:

- Completely reshaping and reorganizing control flow (e.g., replace loops with recursion or alternate loop constructs, split or merge conditional branches, invert conditions or reorder logical expressions).
- Altering data structure representations and usage patterns (e.g., replace arrays with lists or maps, use different iteration methods, transform inline expressions to explicit sequences and vice versa).
- Renaming all local variables and parameters arbitrarily but consistently within scope, avoiding reuse of original variable names.
- Modifying formatting and pseudocode idioms broadly (e.g., change assignment syntax, rearrange statements, use different pseudocode keywords or phrasing) without ambiguity.
- Converting single-line constructs into multiline forms or vice versa wherever possible.

Do not modify or introduce any new functions or classes beyond those originally present, nor change their signatures or nesting. Avoid adding any comments, explanations, annotations, or extraneous text; output only the rewritten pseudocode that can be clearly understood, unambiguously valid, and behaviorally equivalent to the input.  
Ensure that all original function and class identifiers—names and parameter orders—remain exactly as in the input, embedded in the same class and object structures.  
The output must contain solely the rewritten pseudocode.
