Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally identical version that differs as much as possible in syntax, style, and structure, while strictly preserving all class names, function names, method signatures (parameter names, order, and types), and the entire class and object hierarchy exactly as in the original. Your rewritten pseudocode must adhere to these rules:

- **Preserve exactly**:  
  - All class names and their nesting/encapsulation.  
  - All function and method names, including their parameters in name, order, and type.  
  - The overall class and object structure, nesting, and containment of code elements.

- **Freely transform everything else**:  
  1. Convert any control flow constructs into fundamentally different but logically equivalent forms. For example, convert `for` loops into `while` loops, tail recursion, or use equivalent iterator patterns; replace `if-else` chains with guard clauses, switches, or boolean algebra expansions; invert conditions where appropriate; reorder logically independent statements.  
  2. Rename every local variable, temporary variable, loop counter, and intermediate identifier to a completely unrelated name with no shared substrings or roots, using descriptive or arbitrary identifiers.  
  3. Alter iteration and traversal styles (index-based to element-based and vice versa), modify increment/decrement operations, change loop boundaries or conditions equivalently.  
  4. Replace data structure types with semantically equal variants where possible (e.g., “array” ↔ “list”, “tuple” ↔ “pair”), or synonymize operations on them.  
  5. Rewrite all arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions using equivalences, alternative formulations, distribution or factoring, De Morgan’s laws, or other boolean/logical identities that do not change semantics.  
  6. Break down complex expressions into smaller intermediate steps or combine simple statements into compact expressions differently.  
  7. Adjust keyword usage and phrasing extensively by replacing keywords with synonyms or descriptive phrases (e.g., “SET X TO Y” ↔ “ASSIGN Y TO X”, “CONTINUE” ↔ “SKIP TO NEXT ITERATION”).  
  8. Change formatting, indentation style, and line breaks freely to produce a distinct visual style.  

- **Do NOT add or remove any classes, functions, methods, or change the signatures or encapsulation rules. Do NOT add or remove comments or any explanatory text.**

- **The output must be well-formed, unambiguous, and clearly readable pseudocode that any knowledgeable reader can verify to be functionally equivalent despite stylistic and structural differences.**

- **Return only the rewritten pseudocode—no additional text, explanation, or annotations.**
