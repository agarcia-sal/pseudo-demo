Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally identical but syntactically and stylistically distinct version, strictly observing these requirements:

- **Maintain all class names, function names, method signatures (parameter names, order, and types), and the complete class and object hierarchy exactly as in the original pseudocode.** Do not add, remove, rename, reorder, or restructure these identifiers or their nesting.

- Within those constraints, transform every other aspect *maximally* to ensure the rewritten pseudocode is minimally similar at a surface level, while preserving its semantics. This includes:

  - Radical restructuring of control flow (e.g., convert loops to recursion or different loop styles; refactor if-else chains into guard clauses or switch-style constructs; invert/expand boolean expressions, split/combine conditions).

  - Fully rename all local variables, loop counters, and temporary identifiers to new, unrelated names that share no etymological root or resemblance with the originals.

  - Change iteration and traversal techniques—for example, use iterators vs. indexed loops; process elements in different orders if logically permissible.

  - Substitute data structure representations with their semantic equivalents (e.g., list ↔ array, tuple ↔ pair, dictionary ↔ map), modifying how they are expressed accordingly.

  - Rewrite all arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions into equivalent alternative forms (e.g., use arithmetic identities, Boolean algebra transformations).

  - Decompose or consolidate expressions with intermediate variables as needed; reorder independent statements without changing semantics.

  - Replace standard pseudocode keywords with synonyms or descriptive phrases, vary casing and phrasing (e.g., `ASSIGN TO` ↔ `SET TO`; `FOR EACH` ↔ `ITERATE OVER`), as long as clarity and correctness remain.

  - Alter formatting, whitespace, and indentation freely to produce clear, readable output that looks distinctly different from the original.

- **Do not add, remove, or alter comments, explanations, or annotations of any kind. The output must be solely pseudocode.**

- The transformed pseudocode must be unambiguous and clearly preserve original functionality, so a knowledgeable reader can verify equivalence despite maximal superficial divergence.

- **Only output rewritten pseudocode; no explanations, headings, or extra text.** The output should be ready to use as-is for review or automated testing.

In summary: produce a fully functionally equivalent pseudocode rewriting that keeps *all class and function identifiers and structure untouched*, but differs *at every other syntactic, lexical, structural, and stylistic aspect* as drastically as possible—variable names, control flow style, data representation, expression form, iteration methods, keywords, formatting, and more.
