Rewrite the given pseudocode into a fully equivalent pseudocode that preserves **all original class names, function names, method signatures (including parameter names, order, and types), and the class/object hierarchy exactly as they are** without adding, removing, or rearranging any classes, functions, or methods. Their encapsulation and nesting must remain identical.

Subject to this strict structural and naming preservation, apply *aggressive* and *varied* transformations across all other aspects of the pseudocode to maximize syntactic and stylistic divergence, while retaining perfect semantic equivalence. Your rewriting strategies should include, but are not limited to:

- Replace all local variables, loop indices, and temporary identifiers with completely unrelated names that share no common roots or letter sequences to the originals.
- Alter control flows extensively: switch among all logically equivalent constructs such as `for`, `while`, recursion, `if-else` chains, `switch/case`, guard clauses, or others supported in pseudocode.
- Re-express all logical, arithmetic, and comparison expressions into different but equivalent formulations (e.g., negate and invert boolean expressions, rewrite inequalities, unfold or combine conditions).
- Change iteration styles and patterns (e.g., element-wise vs index-based iteration, loop unrolling, early exits).
- Substitute data structures with semantically interchangeable alternatives (e.g., arrays ↔ lists, sets ↔ hash maps for membership checks).
- Decompose or combine expressions by introducing or removing intermediate helper variables.
- Reorder independent statements or distinct code blocks where the logic permits without changing behavior.
- Modify all formatting features, including indentation styles, line breaks, and keyword phrasing—replace keywords with clear synonyms or descriptive phrases (e.g., `ASSIGN X TO Y` ↔ `SET X AS Y`, `INCREMENT` ↔ `ADD 1 TO`, `RETURN` ↔ `OUTPUT`).
- Omit all comments, explanations, or annotations; output must contain *only* the transformed pseudocode.

The output **must remain clean, well-formed, and unambiguously faithful to the logic of the original pseudocode**—a knowledgeable reader should be able to verify the functional equivalence while easily recognizing the stylistic and syntactic differences at every level except for class and function identifiers and structure, which must be exactly preserved.

**Important:**  
- Preserve **exactly** the original class and function/method names, parameter lists, and nesting structure.  
- Only alter local internals to maximize difference—no structural changes allowed.  
- Output only the transformed pseudocode—no explanations, comments, or supplementary text.

This prompt aims for maximal syntactic and stylistic novelty *with perfect functional matching* and strict preservation of all public API components and class/function layouts.
