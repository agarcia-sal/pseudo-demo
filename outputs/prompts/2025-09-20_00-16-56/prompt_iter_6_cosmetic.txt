Rewrite the input pseudocode into a fully equivalent version that preserves all original function names, class names, and the exact class and object structures, but differs maximally in every other aspect to reduce syntactic similarity. Produce pseudocode onlyâ€”no explanations, comments, or extra text. Achieve maximal structural diversity by applying any combination of these transformations wherever possible and safe: use alternative control flow constructs (e.g., replace for-loops with while-loops or recursion, swaps between if-else chains and switch/select statements); rename local variables and parameters consistently with distinct, unrelated identifiers; reorganize or reorder logically independent code blocks; transform expressions by expanding inline computations into explicit sequences or collapsing multi-step operations into succinct expressions; change data representations (e.g., arrays to lists, maps to associative pairs) while maintaining semantics; invert logical conditions by restructuring branches; replace arithmetic or boolean operators with logically equivalent alternatives; convert repeated code patterns into alternative idioms; and reorder independent statements or loops within allowed semantic constraints. Never alter any function or class signatures (names, parameters, hierarchy), nor introduce new functions, classes, variables, or change the class/object architecture. The output must be unambiguously valid pseudocode functionally identical to the input but maximally different in style, naming, formatting, and control flow from the original. Only output the transformed pseudocode.
