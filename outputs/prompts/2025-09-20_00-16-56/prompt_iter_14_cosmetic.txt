Rewrite the provided pseudocode to produce a semantically identical but stylistically and structurally distinct version while strictly preserving **all original function names, class names, parameter lists, and the exact class hierarchy and object structures**. Your transformation should include:

- Comprehensive restructuring of control flow (replace `for` loops with `while`, `while` with recursion, conditionals reordered or inverted, etc.)
- Systematic renaming of all local variables to arbitrary but consistent placeholders distinct from the originals, except for function and class identifiers which must remain exactly as in the input
- Use alternative but correct pseudocode idioms and patterns (e.g., transform inline expressions into stepwise operations or vice versa, convert conditional branches into switch-like constructs or chained conditionals) 
- Rearrange or refactor logical blocks and sequences where it does not affect program behavior or output
- Alter data structure representations and manipulations creatively (e.g., replace array indexing with iterative traversal and counters, substitute explicit list operations with equivalent manual steps)
- Vary formatting conventions (indentations, line breaks, keyword styles) while maintaining unambiguous syntactical correctness
- Do **not** add any comments, explanations, annotations, or extraneous textâ€”output only valid pseudocode that faithfully replicates original program logic and behavior

The output must be **only the rewritten pseudocode** consistent with the above constraints. This transformation aims to maximize syntactic and structural divergence from the original input while guaranteeing full functional equivalence.
