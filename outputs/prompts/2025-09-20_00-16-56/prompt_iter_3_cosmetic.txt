Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a logically equivalent version that preserves all original functionality exactly, including all function names, class names, and their hierarchical structures, but transforms its presentation by thoroughly altering syntax, control flow constructs, variable names, data structures (when possible without changing logic), and phrasing style. Avoid using similar sentence structures or wording seen in the input. Do not add or remove any algorithms, conditions, or operations, and do not include any comments, explanations, or annotationsâ€”output strictly the rewritten pseudocode alone. The output must maintain the original class and method hierarchy intact.
