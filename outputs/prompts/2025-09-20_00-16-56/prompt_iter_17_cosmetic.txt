Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a fully functionally equivalent version that is maximally distinct in style and structure from the original pseudocode. Adhere strictly to the following conditions:

- Keep **all class names**, **function names**, **method signatures** (parameter names, order, and types), and the exact **class and object hierarchy** unchanged. Do not add, remove, or reorder any classes or functions; preserve their encapsulation and nesting exactly.

- Otherwise, you have full freedom to modify *everything else*, including but not limited to:
  - Transform control flow structures (e.g., replace `for` loops with `while` loops or recursion, unfold/fold conditionals, swap `if-else` chains with `switch/case` or guard clauses).
  - Change the style of iteration, traversal, and indexing (e.g., iterate by index vs. element, or use different looping constructs).
  - Rename **all local variables, loop counters, and temporary identifiers** to names that share no roots or similarity with the originals.
  - Alter formatting, indentation, and pseudocode keywords or phrasing. Use synonyms or descriptive phrases in place of keywords (e.g., `SET X TO Y` ↔ `ASSIGN Y TO X`).
  - Break down or combine expressions with intermediate variables, reorder independent operations, reorder logically independent blocks, invert or extend boolean checks without changing logic.
  - Replace data structure types with semantically equivalent alternatives where possible (e.g., array ↔ list; tuple ↔ pair).
  - Rewrite arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions in equivalent but differently formed expressions.

- **Do not add or remove any comments, annotations, or explanatory text**. The output must be solely the transformed pseudocode.

- Make the output clearly readable, well-formed, and unambiguously representative of the original logic, without any semantic deviation.

- The goal is that a knowledgeable reader can confirm functional identity while recognizing the rewrite as substantially different at every syntactic and stylistic level _except_ for class and function identifiers, which remain exactly the same and in the original structure.

Only output the rewritten pseudocode—no additional explanation or text.
