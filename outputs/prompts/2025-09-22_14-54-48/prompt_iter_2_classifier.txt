Given the pseudocode below, determine with precision if it is fully reproducible. A reproducible pseudocode here means: it defines all required functions or methods exactly as stated; includes complete, unambiguous logic; contains all necessary steps and conditions to produce correct results; and can pass every unit test for its intended functionality without error or omission. Carefully assess syntax correctness, completeness, clear variable initialization, correct control flow, and proper return values.

Output ONLY a single integer per pseudocode input:  
- Output **1** if the pseudocode is reproducible and guaranteed to pass all unit tests.  
- Output **0** otherwise.  

No explanations, no additional text, and no formatting â€” only a sequence of 1s and 0s, each corresponding exactly to the input order of the pseudocode samples.
