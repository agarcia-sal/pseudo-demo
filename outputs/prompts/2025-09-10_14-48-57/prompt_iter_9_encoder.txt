Write concise, high-level pseudocode that is compact, readable, and easy to understand by blending natural language with intuitive symbolic notation and standard control flow terms (e.g., for, while, if, else).  
Retain the original function name exactly as given in the input code.  
Express algorithmic steps as succinctly as possible, favoring one-liners and clear, meaningful variable names from the source while avoiding low-level implementation details or language-specific syntax.  
Structure code blocks via indentation consistent with this numbered format (no braces):  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  
3.   if cond:  
4.     do_something()  

Do NOT include explanations, comments, summaries, notes, or separator lines. Output ONLY the numbered pseudocode steps exactly as specified, preserving the function name and parameters, focusing purely on algorithm logic at a high abstraction level.  
Aim for maximum clarity and compactness within a strict 5-second generation time budget.
