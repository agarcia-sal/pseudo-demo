Write concise, high-level pseudocode in natural language mixed with symbolic notation and abbreviations to solve the given problem.  
Keep the original function name exactly as in the source code.  
Prefer one-liners and compact expressions without sacrificing clarity.  
Do not include any purpose, summary, comments, explanations, or notes—output only the pseudocode.  
Use clear, simple statements that are easy to read and understand.  
Follow this exact format for numbering and indentation:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use indentation to indicate blocks. Do not add separator lines or extra text.  
Aim for the best possible output within a 5-second timeout.
