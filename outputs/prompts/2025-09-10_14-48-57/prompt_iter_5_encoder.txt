Write concise, high-level pseudocode that is easy to read and understand by mixing natural language with intuitive symbolic notation and abbreviations.  
Preserve the original function name exactly as defined in the input code.  
Prioritize compactness using one-liners and expressions without losing clarity.  
Exclude any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes—output only the pseudocode.  
Follow this exact numbered format with indentation to indicate code blocks:  

1. x ← 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Use natural variable names as in the source; use familiar control flow terms (e.g., for, while, if, else).  
Do not add separator lines or extraneous text.  
Keep the pseudocode focused on algorithmic steps at a high level, avoiding implementation details or language-specific syntax.  
Aim for the best possible output within a strict 5-second timeout.
