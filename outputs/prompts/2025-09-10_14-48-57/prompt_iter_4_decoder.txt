Translate the given pseudocode into a complete, correct, and efficient Python function or class method, strictly preserving all function names, parameters, and return behavior as implied or explicitly shown in the pseudocode. Use any standard Python libraries if needed for optimal performance and clarity. Enclose the entire Python code in a single ```python ... ``` code block. Do not include any additional explanations, comments, or textâ€”only the code. Your solution should be fully self-contained and ready to run independently within a 5-second execution limit.
