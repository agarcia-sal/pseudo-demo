Translate the given pseudocode into a fully self-contained, syntactically correct, and efficient Python function or class method that exactly matches the function name(s), parameter(s), and return behavior implied or explicitly stated in the pseudocode.  
If the pseudocode suggests a class method, generate a class named `Solution` containing that method; otherwise, generate a standalone function.  
Use only standard Python conventions and libraries to maximize clarity and performance.  
Ensure all necessary imports are included.  
Return only the complete Python code wrapped inside a single Python code block using ```python ... ```.  
Do not include any explanations, comments, debug prints, or additional text outside the code block.  
Make sure the code is immediately executable and respects a 5-second runtime constraint.
