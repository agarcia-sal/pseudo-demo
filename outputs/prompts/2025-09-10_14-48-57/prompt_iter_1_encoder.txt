Write pseudocode to solve the given problem. The pseudocode should be concise, easy to read, and understandable, using natural language combined with symbolic representations and abbreviations. Use one-liners when possible. Do not include any purpose, summary, overview statements, notes, comments, or explanations. Follow this format strictly:

1. x ‚Üê 0  
2. while x < n: x++  

Produce only the pseudocode without extra text. Remember, your function has a 5-second timeout; aim for the best output within this limit.
