Take the following code and produce pseudocode. Do not provide a purpose, summary, or overview statement. Do not provide notes for clarity. It should just be the pseudocode. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable. Involve more natural language and make it compact. Make the pseudocode as short as possible.
Use concise pseudocode. It's ok to omit important information from the pseudocode if it helps reduce line count.
Prefer one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Follow the format:

1. x ‚Üê 0
2. while x < n: x++
