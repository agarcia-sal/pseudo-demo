You are an expert in the domain of writing prompts for generating a different version of a given pseudocode.
Your task is to design a prompt that when fed pseudocode as input, 
will generate a version of the pseudocode that is as different as possible from the original pseudocode,
while still maintaining all of its functionality.
The prompt should be general and not specific to any given problem.
Only output one prompt.
Below is a previously developed prompt. Your goal is to enhance this solution to further improve its test-time performance:\n

{prompt}\n

Here are example outputs from the existing prompt as well as the scores across all problems:\n

{feedback}\n

These scores are normalized, with higher values indicating better performance. 
Higher values indicate that the pseudocode generated from the prompt has a high passing rate when translated to code while also having a low BLEU score when compared to the original pseudocode, 
meaning that the generated pseudocode is substantially syntactically different from the orignal pseudocode.
Analyze these evaluation results carefully to identify areas for improvement.\n\n
Then, implement your proposed improvements in a new prompt based on the previous solution provided.
You are encouraged to propose significant, innovative improvementsâ€”your prompt should be distinctly different and clearly superior. 
If you have a completely new and more effective approach, feel free to abandon the previous method and adopt your new approach. 
Your function has a {timeout}-second timeout; aim to return the best possible results within this limit.

The prompt should state the following:
The output should just be the pseudocode.
It is important to keep the same function names as in the original code.
It is important to keep the same class names as in the original code and in the same class and object structures.
