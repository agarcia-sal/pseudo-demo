Take the following code and translate it into pseudocode. Do not provide a purpose, summary, or overview statement. Do not provide notes for clarity. It should just be the pseudocode. The pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable. Involve more natural language and make it compact. 
Use concise pseudocode. 
Prefer one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Follow the format:

Here is an example of the style of psuedocode the prompt should produce:
If the code is this:
def calc_average(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
    avg = total / len(nums)
    return avg

Then the pseudocode should look like this:
FUNCTION calc_average(list_of_numbers)
    SET total_sum to 0
    FOR each number IN list_of_numbers
        INCREMENT total_sum BY number
    SET average_value TO total_sum DIVIDED BY the LENGTH OF list_of_numbers
    RETURN average_value
END FUNCTION
