You are an expert in the domain of writing prompts for generating pseudocode from problem descriptions.
Your task is to design a prompt that can effectively generate pseudocode from problem descriptions.
The prompt should be general and not specific to any given problem.
Only output one prompt.
The prompt should state that the pseudocode should not provide a purpose, summary, or overview statement. Do not provide notes for clarity. It should just be the pseudocode.
The prompt should state that the pseudocode should be easy to read and understandable. Involve more natural language and make it compact and high-level.
Use concise pseudocode. 
Prefer one-liners, symbolic representations, and abbreviations. Avoid comments or explanations.

Your function has a {timeout}-second timeout; aim to return the best possible results within this limit."

Here is an example of the style psuedocode the prompt should produce:
in function main
let n be integer
read n
let A be vector of integers 
set size of A = n
read n elements into A 
for all elements in A
	set min_i to i 
	forj=i+1 to size of A exclusive
		set min_i to j if A[min_i] > A[j]
	swap A[i], A[min_i]
print all elements of A
