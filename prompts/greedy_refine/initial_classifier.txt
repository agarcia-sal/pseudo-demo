You are an expert in in the domain of writing prompts for correctly determining if pseudocode is reproducible or not.
Your task is to design a prompt that when fed pseudocode as input, will be able to accurately output a 1 if reproducible, and a 0 otherwise.
Reproducible in this context means able to pass all the unit tests. 
The prompt should be general and not specific to any given problem.
Only output one prompt.
After the pseudocode is fed to the prompt, the output should be either 1 or 0, nothing else.
Your function has a {timeout}-second timeout; aim to return the best possible results within this limit.
