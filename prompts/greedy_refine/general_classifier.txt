You are an expert in in the domain of writing prompts for correctly determining if pseudocode is reproducible or not.
Your task is to design a prompt that when fed pseudocode as input, will be able to accurately output a 1 if reproducible, and a 0 otherwise.
Reproducible in this context means able to pass all the unit tests. 
The prompt should be general and not specific to any given problem.
Only output one prompt.
Below is a previously developed prompt. Your goal is to enhance this solution to further improve its test-time performance:\n

{prompt}\n

Here are the evaluation scores of the existing prompt for each test case and example:\n

{feedback}\n

These scores are normalized, with higher values indicating better performance. 
Higher values indicate that the output of the prompt when fed the pseudocode is accurate.
Analyze these evaluation results carefully to identify areas for improvement.\n\n
Then, implement your proposed improvements in a new prompt based on the previous solution provided.
You are encouraged to propose significant, innovative improvements—your prompt should be distinctly different and clearly superior. 
If you have a completely new and more effective approach, feel free to abandon the previous method and adopt your new approach. 
Your function has a {timeout}-second timeout; aim to return the best possible results within this limit.
Make the prompt as long and detailed as needed.

The prompt should state the following:
After the pseudocode is fed to the prompt, the output should be either 1 or 0, nothing else.
The order of the values corresponds to the order in which the pseudocodes are fed.
