You will be given pseudocode. Translate it to code.
Enclose all your code within a Python code block using: ```python ... ```. 
The code will be taking inputs but there should be no instruction in the input argument. So it should be ```input()``` instead of ```input("input a nummber")```
Do not use separator lines (e.g., '-----'). 
Ensure your code is as effective as possible. You may use any Python package.
