FUNCTION exchange WITH PARAMETERS lst1, lst2
    SET odd TO 0
    SET even TO 0
    FOR INDEX i FROM 0 TO LENGTH OF lst1 MINUS 1
        IF lst1 AT i MODULO 2 EQUALS 1
            INCREMENT odd BY 1
    FOR INDEX i FROM 0 TO LENGTH OF lst2 MINUS 1
        IF lst2 AT i MODULO 2 EQUALS 0
            INCREMENT even BY 1
    IF even GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO odd
        RETURN "YES"
    RETURN "NO"
