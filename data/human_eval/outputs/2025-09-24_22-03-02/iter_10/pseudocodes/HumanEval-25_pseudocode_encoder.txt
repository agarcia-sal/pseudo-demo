FUNCTION factorize WITH PARAMETER n
    SET fact TO empty list
    SET i TO 2
    WHILE i LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO integer part of (square root of n PLUS 1)
        IF n MODULO i EQUALS 0
            APPEND i TO fact
            SET n TO n DIVIDED BY i
        ELSE
            INCREMENT i BY 1
    IF n GREATER THAN 1
        APPEND n TO fact
    RETURN fact
