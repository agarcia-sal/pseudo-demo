FUNCTION derivative(xs: list)
    SET result TO EMPTY LIST
    FOR EACH i FROM 0 TO LENGTH OF xs MINUS 1
        SET x TO xs AT INDEX i
        SET product TO i MULTIPLY x
        APPEND product TO result
    SET derivative_result TO EMPTY LIST
    FOR EACH element FROM INDEX 1 TO LENGTH OF result MINUS 1 IN result
        APPEND element TO derivative_result
    RETURN derivative_result
