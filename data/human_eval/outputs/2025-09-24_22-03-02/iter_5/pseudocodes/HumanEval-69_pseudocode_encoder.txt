FUNCTION search(lst)
    SET frq TO list of zeros with length maximum value in lst plus one
    FOR each i IN lst
        INCREMENT frq at index i by one

    SET ans TO negative one
    FOR i FROM one TO length of frq minus one
        IF frq at index i IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO i
            SET ans TO i

    RETURN ans
