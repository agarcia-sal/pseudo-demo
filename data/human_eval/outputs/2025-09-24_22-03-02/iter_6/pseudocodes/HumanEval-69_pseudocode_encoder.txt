FUNCTION search(lst)
    SET frequency_list TO list of zeros with length maximum value in lst plus one
    FOR each number IN lst
        INCREMENT frequency_list at index number BY one
    SET answer TO negative one
    FOR each index FROM one TO length of frequency_list minus one
        IF frequency_list at index IS greater than or equal to index
            SET answer TO index
    RETURN answer
