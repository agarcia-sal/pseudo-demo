Translate the given pseudocode into correct, efficient, and idiomatic Python code with the following requirements:

- Preserve all function and class names exactly as given, including their parameter names and return types if specified.
- Maintain any class definitions, methods, and object structures exactly as indicated.
- You must include all imports required to make the code execute correctly (e.g., `import math`, `import copy`, `import random`, etc.).
- Use Python standard libraries or built-in modules as needed to improve clarity and performance.
- Write concise, readable, and Pythonic code without adding any explanatory comments, docstrings, or unrelated output.
- Do not alter any function or class signatures in any way unless explicitly directed by the pseudocode.
- Ensure the code handles edge cases robustly and runs efficiently within a 5-second execution constraint on typical inputs.
- Output only valid Python code enclosed inside a single code block formatted exactly like this:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Provide no additional text or explanation beyond this code block.
