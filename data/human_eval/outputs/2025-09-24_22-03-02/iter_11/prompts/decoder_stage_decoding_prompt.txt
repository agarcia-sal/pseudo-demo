Translate the given pseudocode into efficient, idiomatic Python code, strictly preserving all function and class names along with their parameters and return types exactly as specified. Maintain the original class and object structures without modification. Your implementation must be correct, concise, and optimize clarity and performance using Pythonic constructs and any relevant standard libraries. 

Explicitly include all necessary imports so the code runs without external dependencies or errors such as undefined names. Avoid adding comments or any text outside the Python code itself.

Enclose absolutely all your code inside a single Python code block formatted exactly as shown below:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Only provide this Python code blockâ€”no explanations, headings, or additional text. Ensure the entire submission executes correctly within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
