Translate the provided pseudocode into fully functional Python code that precisely preserves all function and class names, including their parameters and return types exactly as given. Ensure all class definitions, method signatures, and object relationships mirror the pseudocode structure without any modification. Your implementation must be clear, Pythonic, and optimized for correctness and efficiency, using standard or widely accepted external Python libraries if necessary. 

Critically, include any required imports to avoid runtime errors due to missing dependencies. Handle common edge cases implicitly where appropriate to increase robustness, but do not add functionality beyond what the pseudocode specifies.

Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional output; only provide syntactically correct Python code that will run within 5 seconds on typical inputs.

Enclose your entire solution exclusively within a single Python fenced code block formatted exactly like this:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Provide only the Python code inside the blockâ€”nothing else.
