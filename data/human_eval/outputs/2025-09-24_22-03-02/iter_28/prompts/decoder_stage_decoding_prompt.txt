Translate the provided pseudocode into fully functional Python code, strictly preserving all function names, class names, method signatures, parameter names, and return types exactly as given in the pseudocode. Keep all class hierarchies and object-oriented structures intact. Your translation should produce clean, idiomatic Python code that is both efficient and readable. You may import and utilize any standard or widely available Python libraries to improve correctness, robustness, and performance. Handle edge cases, potential exceptions, and input validations as reasonable based on the pseudocode context.

Do not include any text explanations, comments, or debug printsâ€”only the exact Python code translation. Do not alter function or class definitions beyond what is explicitly specified in the pseudocode. Always return your entire solution enclosed within a single Python code block formatted exactly as follows:

```python
# your translated Python code here
```

Output only this code block and nothing else.
