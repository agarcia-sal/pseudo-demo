Translate the given pseudocode into Python code, preserving all function and class names, as well as their parameters and return types exactly as specified. Maintain any class and object structures faithfully. Your code must be efficient, clear, and concise, using Pythonic constructs where appropriate. You may import and use any standard Python libraries to enhance correctness and performance. 

Do not include any extraneous text, explanations, or comments. Do not alter function or class signatures unless explicitly stated in the pseudocode. Ensure the code runs within 5 seconds for typical inputs.

Enclose all your code inside a single Python code block formatted exactly like this:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Only provide the Python code inside this blockâ€”nothing else.
