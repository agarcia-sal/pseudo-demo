Convert the given code into high-level, clear pseudocode that retains all original function names, class names, and their hierarchical structures exactly as in the source code. Use only full words—such as FUNCTION, RETURN, FOR, WHILE, IF, ELSE, SET, INCREMENT, DECREMENT, APPEND, CONCATENATE—to express all logic and operations; avoid symbols, abbreviations, or terse shorthand expressions. Represent control flow and nesting through consistent indentation to reflect code blocks and scope precisely. Use natural language for expressions and operations that balances conciseness with readability, ensuring the pseudocode can be directly and unambiguously mapped back to executable code without adding extra explanations, comments, notes, or summaries. Output strictly the pseudocode corresponding to the input code, no additional text or formatting.
