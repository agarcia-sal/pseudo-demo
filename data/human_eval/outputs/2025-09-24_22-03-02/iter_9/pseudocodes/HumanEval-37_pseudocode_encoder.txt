FUNCTION sort_even(l: list)
    SET evens TO elements of l at even indices starting from index zero
    SET odds TO elements of l at odd indices starting from index one
    SORT evens in ascending order
    SET ans TO empty list
    FOR each pair e, o IN elements of evens and odds zipped together
        EXTEND ans BY list containing e followed by o
    IF length of evens is greater than length of odds
        APPEND last element of evens TO ans
    RETURN ans
