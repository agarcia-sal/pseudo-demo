Convert the given code into clear, structured pseudocode preserving original function and class names, as well as class/object hierarchies. Express all logic using descriptive keywords (e.g., FUNCTION, RETURN, FOR, IF, SET) in full words rather than symbols or abbreviations. Use proper indentation to reflect code blocks. Represent expressions naturally but keep them concise and readable without oversimplifying. Do not add any explanations, comments, summaries, or notes. Output only the pseudocode corresponding exactly to the original code logic and structure, enabling direct mapping back to runnable code.
