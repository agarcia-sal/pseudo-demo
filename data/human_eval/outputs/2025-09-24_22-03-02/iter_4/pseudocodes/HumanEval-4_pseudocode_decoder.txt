FUNCTION mean_absolute_deviation WITH PARAMETER numbers AS LIST OF FLOAT RETURNS FLOAT
    SET mean TO sum of all elements in numbers DIVIDED BY length of numbers
    SET total_absolute_deviation TO ZERO
    FOR EACH element IN numbers
        SET total_absolute_deviation TO total_absolute_deviation PLUS absolute value of (element MINUS mean)
    RETURN total_absolute_deviation DIVIDED BY length of numbers
