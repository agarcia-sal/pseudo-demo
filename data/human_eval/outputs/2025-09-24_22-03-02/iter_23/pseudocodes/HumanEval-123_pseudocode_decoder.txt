        "Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

        The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
        as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
        previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
        the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
        term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

        Note: 
            1. Collatz(1) is [1].
            2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

        For example:
        get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5."
