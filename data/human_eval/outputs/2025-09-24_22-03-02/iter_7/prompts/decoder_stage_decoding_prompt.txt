Translate the given pseudocode into fully functional Python 3 code that matches all provided function and class names, signatures, parameters, and return types exactly as specified in the pseudocode. Preserve all class and object structures precisely, including inheritance and method scopes. Your code must be correct, efficient, idiomatic, and concise, leveraging built-in and standard Python libraries where appropriate to improve clarity and performance. 

- Do not rename or reorder functions, classes, or parameters.
- Do not add explanations, comments, or extra text.
- Anticipate and include any necessary imports within the code block.
- Include robust handling of edge cases based on the pseudocode logic.
- Write code that executes within 5 seconds on typical inputs.
- Assume any required standard Python modules can be imported.
- Ensure the final answer is a single, syntactically correct, runnable Python snippet.

Enclose all code exactly within one Python code block like this:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Provide only the Python code inside this blockâ€”nothing else.
