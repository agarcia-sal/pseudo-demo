FUNCTION sort_even l
    SET evens TO elements of l at even indices starting from zero
    SET odds TO elements of l at odd indices starting from one
    CALL sort on evens
    SET ans TO empty list
    FOR EACH e, o IN pairwise elements of evens and odds
        CALL extend ans WITH list containing e and o
    IF length of evens GREATER THAN length of odds
        CALL append on ans WITH last element of evens
    RETURN ans
