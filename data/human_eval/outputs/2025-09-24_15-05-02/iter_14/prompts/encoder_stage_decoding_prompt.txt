Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code. Your translation **must**:

- Preserve all function names, parameter names, class names, and class/object structures exactly as stated in the pseudocode.
- Include all necessary imports explicitly within the same Python code block.
- Use clear, descriptive variable names consistent with the pseudocode; add concise comments **only** when they improve understanding.
- Ensure correct and idiomatic Python syntax suitable for immediate execution, handling any implied edge cases.
- Guarantee the code executes correctly within 5 seconds.
- Enclose **all** code strictly inside a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Do **not** include any explanations, test cases, print statements, or output anything outside the code block. Avoid adding any separators or extraneous text. Your code should strictly reflect the pseudocodeâ€™s logic and structure to maximize correctness and test-time success.
