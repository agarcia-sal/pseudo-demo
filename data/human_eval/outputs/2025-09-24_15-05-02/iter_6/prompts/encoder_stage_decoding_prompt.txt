Translate the following pseudocode into fully functional, clean, and efficient Python code. Your implementation **must**:

- Preserve exactly the same function names, parameters, class names, and object structures as described in the pseudocode.
- Use clear and descriptive variable names; include concise comments only if they improve code clarity.
- Enclose **all** the code within a single Python code block marked with triple backticks and the `python` language identifier:

```python
# Your translated code here
```

Additional requirements:
- The code must run correctly within 5 seconds and handle edge cases implied by the pseudocode.
- Include all necessary imports directly in the code block.
- Do **not** output any textual explanation, test code, or anything outside the code block.
- Avoid adding any extra text or separator lines.

Focus on producing robust, syntactically correct, and idiomatic Python code that directly reflects the pseudocode logic and structure to maximize test-time success.
