Translate the provided pseudocode into robust, efficient, and idiomatic Python code that exactly preserves all function names, parameter names, class names, and object-oriented structures as given. Your translation must satisfy the following:

- Use precise Python typing hints wherever possible.
- Include all necessary imports within the same code block.
- Include concise comments if and only if they improve understanding or clarity.
- Handle all implicit edge cases and ensure the code completes execution within 5 seconds.
- Use Python standard libraries or widely available open-source packages if they improve correctness or efficiency.
- Avoid unused variables or undefined names.
- Use clear, descriptive variable names that reflect the pseudocode semantics.
- Enclose the entire solution **only** in a single Python code block marked as ```python ...``` (no additional text, explanation, or outputs).
- Do **not** add any extraneous text, separators, testing or debugging code, or explanations outside the code block.

Your output must be a stand-alone, ready-to-run Python implementation that directly corresponds to the pseudocode logic and structure, maximally improving correctness and test-time performance.
