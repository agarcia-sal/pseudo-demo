Translate the given pseudocode into clean, idiomatic, and fully functional Python code **that runs correctly and efficiently within 5 seconds**. Your translation must:

- Preserve **exactly** all function names, parameters, class names, and object hierarchies as defined in the pseudocode.
- Include all necessary imports explicitly within the code block.
- Use clear, descriptive variable names consistent with the pseudocode where possible; add comments **only** for clarifying non-trivial logic.
- Correctly handle all implicit edge cases and data types suggested by the pseudocode.
- Implement complete code with no missing return statements, loops, or blocks.
- Avoid adding any test code, explanations, or output outside the code block.
- Use any Python standard library or reputable third-party package if it improves correctness or performance.
- Enclose **all** code strictly inside one Python code block labeled with `python`:

```python
# Your translated Python code here
```

Focus on robust, idiomatic, fully self-contained Python code that precisely reflects the pseudocodeâ€™s logic and structure, maximizing correctness, efficiency, and test-time reliability.
