Translate the provided pseudocode into clean, robust, and idiomatic Python code that is ready for immediate execution. Your translation **must** adhere strictly to the following guidelines:

- Preserve all function names, parameter names, class names, and class/object structures **exactly** as given in the pseudocode.
- Include **all** necessary imports explicitly at the top of the code within the same Python code block.
- Use descriptive variable names consistent with the pseudocode. Write concise, meaningful comments only when they clarify non-obvious logic.
- Implement proper type hints wherever applicable, inferring reasonable Python types from the pseudocode.
- Handle implied edge cases rigorously to ensure correctness and robustness without compromising readability.
- Optimize for efficient execution within a 5-second time limit, using appropriate standard library modules or well-known packages if needed.
- Enclose **all** translated code strictly and only inside a single Python code block formatted as:

```python
# your translated code here
```

- Do **not** include any text outside the code block, including explanations, test cases, print statements, or separators.

- Do **not** add extra functions or classes beyond those specified in the pseudocode.

Your output should be a faithful, self-contained Python implementation of the pseudocode logic that maximizes correctness, clarity, and runtime reliability.
