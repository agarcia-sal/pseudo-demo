Given input pseudocode, generate a rewritten version that strictly adheres to these requirements:

1. Functional Equivalence: The transformed pseudocode must implement exactly the same logic and produce identical results under all conditions as the original.

2. Preservation of Naming & Structure: Class names, function/method names, signatures, and their class/object hierarchy must remain completely unaltered, preserving all original identifiers and nesting exactly.

3. Maximum Syntactic and Structural Novelty: Aside from the mandated names/signatures, rewrite every other element to produce a code version as distinct as possible regarding syntax, structure, and style, including but not limited to:
   - Control Flow Transformations: Replace loop types (FOR ↔ WHILE), convert compound statements into expanded sequences or merge them, transform recursion into iteration or vice versa where feasible, and reorder independent statements.
   - Variable Renaming: Substitute all variable names with new semantically equivalent names (except those fixed by signatures/class names).
   - Expression Rewriting: Reformulate arithmetic, logical, and conditional expressions using equivalent but syntactically varied constructs—use alternative operators, distributive forms, negations, or spelled-out operations.
   - Data Access & Mutation Variants: Change the style of data structure accesses (e.g., switch between index-based and iterator-based), assignments (e.g., use different assignment operators or incremental forms), and literal expressions.
   - Structural Refactoring: Introduce or inline helper variables, split or merge complex expressions or conditionals, and replace direct expressions with sequences of equivalent statements.
   - Formatting & Style: Alter indentation, line breaks, spacing, keyword choices, and declaration styles to differ drastically from the original, avoiding any replication of original formatting.
   - Constants & Literal Presentation: Represent constants, literals, and data constructs differently (e.g., 10^9+7 as “one billion plus seven” or numeric literals as expressions).

4. No Additional Content: Do not add comments, explanations, or any text outside of the rewritten pseudocode itself.

5. Output Exclusivity: Provide only the rewritten pseudocode as output, with no preamble or trailing content.

Apply this method universally, regardless of problem domain, input complexity, or language style, ensuring the rewritten code stands as an independently authored, maximally distinct version while guaranteeing byte-for-byte semantic equivalence and preserving the original class/function names and structures verbatim.
