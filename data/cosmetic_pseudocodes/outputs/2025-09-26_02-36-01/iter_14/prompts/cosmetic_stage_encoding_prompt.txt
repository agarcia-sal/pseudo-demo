Given any input pseudocode, produce a fully transformed and restructured version that meets all of the following absolute constraints and requirements:

1. **Exact semantic equivalence:** The output pseudocode must have the same complete behavior as the input, including producing identical outputs, maintaining all side effects and logical flows without alteration.

2. **Preserve all interface elements strictly:**  
   - Keep unchanged all class names, function/method names, signatures (parameter names, types, order, and return types if specified), class inheritance, and any declared object or data structure layouts.  
   - Do not rename, reorder, restructure, or otherwise alter any such publicly visible or externally referenced identifiers or definitions.

3. **Maximize maximal orthogonal rewrite on everything else, including but not limited to:**  
   - **Identifiers:** Rename all local variables, temporary variables, and parameters used _within_ function bodies to completely fresh, unrelated, non-derivative names avoiding any overlap or resemblance to originals.  
   - **Control flow:** Replace loops by logically equivalent alternative loop types or recursion (for ↔ while ↔ repeat-until ↔ tail recursion), or inline/uninline code blocks; reorder safe independent statements; restructure nested conditionals with equivalent logic; vary return patterns (early return versus deferred variable returns).  
   - **Expressions:** Deeply rewrite all expressions applying algebraic/logical identities, De Morgan transformations, expansions/contractions, replacements of literals by arithmetic expressions or named constants; replace direct standard or built-in calls with custom helper procedures or, conversely, inline helper procedures as standard calls, preserving semantics exactly.  
   - **Data traversal and structure usage:** Alter iteration order, split/merge iterations, combine or decompose loops or conditionals, reorder safe operations that don’t affect state or observable output.  
   - **Helpers/subroutines:** Inline helper functions where appropriate or extract inline code into freshly named helpers, swapping usage between built-in and custom implementations preserving function.  
   - **Formatting and style:** Use varied indentation, line breaks, spacing, delimiters, keyword casing, block structuring, and syntactic sugar style changes thoroughly to ensure minimal lexical or syntactic overlap with input except interface names.  
   - **Statement structure:** Decompose compound statements or merge single statements; re-express boolean checks, invert conditions and swap branches while maintaining overall logic equivalence.

4. **No semantic or algorithmic omission, addition, abstraction, or optimization:** Ensure all algorithmic steps, data structures, intermediate computations, procedural calls, and conceptual constructs are present as in the original, neither removing, adding, nor simplifying logic.

5. **No change to interface-level identifiers or exposed program contracts:** Identifiers that define the program’s exposed contract (class names, method names, signatures) and inheritance hierarchies must remain textually and structurally identical and in place.

6. **Universal applicability:** This rewriting process applies to any pseudocode input regardless of problem domain, size, complexity, or programming paradigm.

7. **Output constraints:**  
   - Output only the fully transformed pseudocode as a complete, standalone code snippet ready for use or comprehension.  
   - Do not output any explanations, commentary, annotations, or metadata—strictly raw pseudocode text only.

**Emphasize** comprehensive, multi-layered, orthogonal rewriting strategies across identifiers, control structures, expressions, data traversal, helper routines, constants, and formatting to achieve maximal syntactical and structural divergence while preserving all required interface elements verbatim and program semantics perfectly, enabling lowest possible surface-level similarity and BLEU scores against the input.

**Summary directive:**  
Input: Original pseudocode  
Output: Semantically identical pseudocode with untouched classes/functions/interfaces and 100% rewritten internals — variables renamed, control flow swapped, expressions reformulated, helpers restructured, data traversals varied, formatting completely changed, and all logic steps intact.

Output strictly the transformed pseudocode only.
