Given any input pseudocode, produce a fully rewritten version that strictly adheres to all the following requirements:

1. **Strict semantic equivalence:** Output pseudocode must have identical behavior to the input, including producing the same outputs, preserving all side effects, maintaining all intermediate states, and following exactly the same logical conditions and data manipulations.

2. **Interface preservation:** Keep all class names, function/method names, their signatures (names, parameter order, types if present, and return types if specified), inheritance hierarchies, and object layout declarations absolutely unchanged and unmodified in any way. Do not rename, reorder, combine, split, or restructure any interface elements or class/instance structures.

3. **Comprehensive orthogonal transformation of implementation details:** For all other constructs, aggressively apply layered and diverse transformations to maximize syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence including but not limited to:

   - Replace *all* loop constructs (for, while, repeat-until) with logically equivalent alternatives or recursion/tail recursion variants retaining exact iteration behaviors.

   - Globally rename *every* local, temporary, and parameter variable (except those in function signatures) to freshly generated identifiers unrelated lexically or semantically to original names, avoiding reusing any original hints.

   - Decompose or combine statements freely: transform single statements into multiple equivalent statements or merge multiple simple statements into compound ones without altering logic.

   - Reorder any independent instructions or condition checks where the program’s correctness, output order, and side effects are strictly unaffected.

   - Thoroughly rewrite all expressions at all levels by applying arithmetic and logical identities, expanding or contracting compound assignments, using De Morgan’s laws, introducing or removing intermediates, and expressing constants as equivalent expressions or symbolic constants.

   - Restructure control flow by shifting early returns to deferred return variables or vice versa, flatten or deepen nested conditional/loop blocks, inline or extract helper routines, or systematically replace direct standard/built-in calls with identical local helper implementations, or vice versa.

   - Change order and style of data traversal (e.g., index order, direction, iterator style) while strictly preserving overall effect and side-effect order.

   - Vary formatting extensively, including indentation styles, line breaks, block delimiters, keyword casing, spacing patterns, blank lines, and ordering of equivalent code blocks—not affecting functionality.

4. **No algorithmic changes:** Do not add, remove, optimize away, combine, or abstract any algorithmic step, data structure, or conceptual element. Preserve all logic, variables, and the entire algorithm in its full original complexity.

5. **Output format:** Provide only the transformed pseudocode as a single complete, standalone code block. Do not include any explanations, comments, annotations, labels, or extraneous text. The transformed code must appear as a totally independently authored implementation with minimal lexical or structural resemblance to the input except for the preserved interface identifiers in classes and function signatures.

6. **Universality:** This transformation applies uniformly to *any* pseudocode input, independent of domain, problem type, programming paradigm, or style.

Emphasize **maximal orthogonal rewriting** across all identifiers, statements, flow controls, expressions, helper routines, constants, and formatting — producing the lowest possible syntactic and structural alignment with the input, while fully preserving the exact class, function signatures, and program semantics verbatim.
