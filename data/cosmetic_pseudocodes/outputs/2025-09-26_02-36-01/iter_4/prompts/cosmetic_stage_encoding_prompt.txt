Given an input pseudocode, rewrite it to produce an alternative version that strictly adheres to the following requirements:

1. **Functionality Preservation**: The rewritten pseudocode must behave identically to the original, with no semantic or functional changes whatsoever.

2. **Class and Function Integrity**:  
   - Preserve all class names exactly as in the original input.  
   - Preserve all function names, method names, and their full signatures without any changes.  
   - Maintain all original class and object hierarchy relationships without modification.

3. **Maximize Structural and Syntactic Diversity**: Change everything else about the code as extensively as possible to produce a pseudocode version that appears as independently authored and dissimilar as possible, including but not limited to:  
   - **Control Flow Transformation**: Convert loops to alternative constructs (e.g., replace `FOR` loops with `WHILE` loops or recursion), split or merge conditionals, invert logic where possible without changing meaning.  
   - **Variable Renaming**: Replace every variable name with a unique, semantically equivalent name different from the original, except for parameters or names fixed by specification (e.g., function parameters if mandated).  
   - **Statement Reordering**: Reorder statements freely when it does not affect the logic or outcomes, including splitting compound statements into simpler sequences or combining sequences into compound statements.  
   - **Expression Reformulation**: Rewrite all expressions, including arithmetic, logical, and conditional expressions, using alternative but equivalent formulations (e.g., use `a = b - (-c)` instead of `a = b + c`, logical negations, De Morgan’s laws, alternative indexing or data access styles, spelled-out number literals, or changed numeric bases).  
   - **Data Structure Transformation**: Rewrite data structures equivalently with different constructions, initialization styles, or access patterns (e.g., replace array comprehensions with explicit loops or vice versa).  
   - **Format Variation**: Change formatting styles extensively—use different keywords or descriptive phrases (e.g., `LET x TO 0`, `SET x AS zero`, or `DECLARE x = 0`), alternate ways to represent increments and decrements, or different styles of defining constants and literals.  
   - **Introduce and Reuse Intermediate Values**: Break down complex expressions into multiple intermediate variables or inline them differently to alter flow and complexity appearance.  
   - **Control Statement Synonyms**: Use synonyms or alternative formulations for control keywords where reasonable (e.g., `CONTINUE` vs `SKIP`, `BREAK` vs exit loop statements described differently).

4. **No Additions Beyond Pseudocode**: Output **only** the rewritten pseudocode. Do **not** add any explanations, comments, clarifications, or any other text.

5. **Universality**: The prompt must apply to all pseudocode inputs, regardless of domain or content.

**Output requirements:**

- Your output must be exclusively the fully rewritten pseudocode that meets all above constraints.  
- The rewritten code must be a self-contained pseudocode snippet appearing distinctly different yet functionally identical.  
- Preserve exactly all original class and function names and hierarchy structures with zero modifications to them.  
- Change everything else as much as logically possible without violating the original semantics.

**Task:**  
Rewrite the input pseudocode accordingly, maximizing syntactic and structural divergence while guaranteeing perfect functional equivalence and preserving class/function names precisely as in the input.  
Output **only** the rewritten pseudocode and nothing else.
