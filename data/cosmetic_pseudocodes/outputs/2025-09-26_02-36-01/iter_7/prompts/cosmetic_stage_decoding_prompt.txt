Translate the given pseudocode into clean, efficient, and fully functional Python code, strictly preserving all original class names, function names, signatures, and their class/object structures exactly as specified. Your implementation must handle all typical input conventions in Python (e.g., use `None` instead of `null`, convert input lists into linked structures or trees as needed) and avoid any runtime errors. 

Enclose your entire code output in a single Python code block like this:

```python
# your translated code here
```

Requirements:
- Do not add extraneous explanations or unrelated comments; only include comments that clarify complex or non-obvious parts of the code.
- The code must be optimized for correctness and efficiency within a 5-second runtime limit.
- You may freely use any standard Python libraries or modules to improve clarity, correctness, and performance.
- Carefully handle boundary cases, proper imports, and data structure conversions implied by the pseudocode.
- Avoid leaving incomplete code fragments or unhandled conditions that cause runtime errors.
- Inputs described in pseudocode as lists that represent trees or linked lists should be converted appropriately using helper functions if needed, respecting Python conventions.
- Maintain idiomatic and readable Python style consistent with best practices.

This approach ensures faithful and robust translations ready for direct use and testing.
