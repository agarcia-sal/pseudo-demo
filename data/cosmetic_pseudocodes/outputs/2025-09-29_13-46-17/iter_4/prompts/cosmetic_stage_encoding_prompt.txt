Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce a fully restructured and reformulated version that is functionally and semantically identical, preserves all function and class names exactly as in the original, and maintains the original class and object hierarchy without alteration. Your rewritten pseudocode must be as syntactically, structurally, and stylistically divergent as possible by exhaustively applying aggressive, safe transformations such as (but not limited to):

- Recast all control flow constructs into fundamentally different paradigms (e.g., replace loops with recursion, recursion with loops, if-else chains with pattern matching or guards, switch-case with nested conditionals, short-circuit logic with explicit branching).
- Completely rename every local variable and parameter throughout the pseudocode using a coherent but non-overlapping naming scheme unrelated to the original names and varying styles (e.g., switch between camelCase, snake_case, UPPERCASE, thematic or mnemonic variables), while keeping all function and class identifiers intact.
- Reorder independent statements, reorder conditions in compound logical expressions, and invert or rewrite conditional logic using equivalent transformations (including De Morgan’s laws) to alter control flow appearance without changing behavior.
- Inline functions into callers or conversely extract repeated code blocks into helper functions, varying between nesting and flattening to diversify structural presentation.
- Convert between equivalent data iteration and access methods (e.g., from indexed loops to iterator-based, for-each constructs, recursive traversals; switch array accesses to dict/map keys where possible or vice versa).
- Alter arithmetic and logical expressions via identities, expansion, factorization, distribution, or normalization that preserve exact results.
- Transform usage of literal constants into equivalent expressions, symbolic constants, or computed values.
- Revise how return statements and value propagation are handled (e.g., early returns vs accumulators, mutable state vs immutable assignments).
- Heavily vary formatting and layout including indentation, spacing, line breaks, block delimiters, and comments removal to maximize visual dissimilarity.
- Re-express accumulative computations using folds, reduces, explicit loops, or recursion interchangeably.
- Restructure control flow to flatten nested constructs where possible or introduce nesting to obfuscate syntactic similarity.
- Use alternative, valid pseudocode idioms or syntax for the same operations holding semantic invariance.
- Pursue any additional safe syntactic, stylistic, or structural rewritings to maximize divergence while preserving all original runtime logic and outputs.

**Absolutely do not modify function or class names, their inheritance or containment relationships, or add/remove any functional behavior or outputs.**  
**Do not provide any explanations, comments, or extra text—output only the complete rewritten pseudocode.**
