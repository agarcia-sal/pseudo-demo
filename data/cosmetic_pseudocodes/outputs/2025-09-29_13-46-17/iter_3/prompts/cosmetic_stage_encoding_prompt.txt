Given the original pseudocode as input, produce a transformed version that preserves all original semantics, functionality, and exact function and class names, along with the original class and object hierarchy unchanged. Your rewritten pseudocode must be as syntactically and stylistically different as possible, employing any combination of the following transformations comprehensively and aggressively:

- Convert all control flow structures to fundamentally different equivalents (e.g., replace all loops with recursion or vice versa; substitute conditionals with guard clauses or pattern matching where applicable)
- Systematically rename **all** local variables and parameters using a consistent but different naming convention (e.g., change `snake_case` to `camelCase` or vice versa, or use thematic naming unrelated to original variable names), while keeping function/class identifiers exactly the same
- Rearrange the order of logically independent statements or expressions to alter flow without changing semantics
- Refactor compound expressions by expanding or consolidating nested operations, using equivalent arithmetic transformations or logical equivalences
- Change how data structures are accessed, iterated, or constructed (e.g., convert index-based loops to iterator-based ones, replace explicit indexing with `for-each` constructs, or vice versa)
- Modify formatting heavily—alter indentation styles, bracket usage, whitespace, and line breaks to maximize visual difference
- Replace literal constants with equivalent expressions or symbolic constants where meaningful
- Use alternative syntactical forms for the same operations (e.g., write `IF NOT condition THEN` in place of `IF condition = False THEN`)
- Decompose or inline helper functions or nested definitions, swapping between them as appropriate
- Change the order of conditions in compound logical expressions, or rewrite them using De Morgan’s laws and equivalent logic
- Vary the style of returning values or setting intermediate variables (e.g., use early returns instead of accumulators, or vice versa)
- Re-express iterative accumulations as folds/reductions or explicit iterative constructs
- Apply any other safe syntactic or structural rewriting that preserves logic exactly

**Critically, do not modify any function or class names or their hierarchy, nor remove or add any functional behavior or outputs.**  
**Output only the fully rewritten pseudocode—no explanations, comments, or extra text.**
