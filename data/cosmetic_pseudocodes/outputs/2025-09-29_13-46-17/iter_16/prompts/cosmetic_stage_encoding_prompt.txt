Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a fully rewritten pseudocode version that is semantically **identical** but exhibits **maximal divergence** from the original at every syntactic, lexical, structural, and stylistic level, while adhering to these strict constraints:

- Preserve all **function and class names exactly** as in the original.
- Keep all **function signatures unchanged** (parameter names, order, and counts intact).
- Maintain the exact same **class declarations, inheritance hierarchies, and nested/inner class structures** without any addition, removal, or reordering.
- Do not add, remove, or reorder any functions, methods, or classes.
- Guarantee identical external behavior, outputs, side effects, and data semantics.
- Do not introduce any new language features, libraries, or constructs beyond standard pseudocode norms.

Your output must be **only** the complete transformed pseudocode—no explanations, comments, or annotations.

To achieve maximal, deeply recursive, multi-dimensional code transformation, combine and interleave exhaustive techniques across all code facets, including but not limited to:

1. **Control Flow Drastic Refactoring:**
   - Convert iterative loops ↔ recursive calls, including mutual recursion, CPS style, explicit continuations.
   - Express all conditionals via diverse patterns: nested if-else chains, early exit guards, Boolean tableaux, switch/case desugaring, pattern matching, polymorphic or data-driven dispatch.
   - Exhaustively rewrite Boolean logic using algebraic identities, e.g., De Morgan's laws, contraposition, double negations, distributive/absorptive laws, layered re-associations, and operand swaps.
   - Replace loops with loop fusion, splitting, unrolling, accumulative folds/reductions, iterator pipelines, or flatten nested loops, ensuring semantic equivalence.

2. **Identifier Renaming with Complex Multi-Scheme Opaqueness:**
   - Rename every local, temporary, helper, and parameter variable to fresh, meaningless names;
   - Employ distinct naming schemes per scope, mixing Unicode symbols, random alphanumeric strings, thematic codenames, inconsistent casing, and glyph sequences;
   - Forbid any mnemonic, semantic, or etymological correlation to original names;
   - Retain original function and class names without any change.

3. **Data Structure and Access Pattern Overhaul:**
   - Replace collection types wherever valid (arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets ↔ queues ↔ maps), adapting access and iteration style accordingly.
   - Alternate access styles between index-based, iterator-based, recursive traversals, generators, or lazy enumerators.
   - Express aggregations via different paradigms, e.g., accumulators, explicit recursion, folds, maps with recursion or iteration.

4. **Expression and Arithmetic Recomposition:**
   - Rewrite arithmetic expressions via equivalent formulations such as loops replacing exponentiation, complex chained constituent computations for constants.
   - Reformulate Boolean expressions in alternative normal forms, via ternary/conditional expressions, or pattern matching over logic tables.
   - Systematically reorder operands and operators based on associative, commutative, distributive properties to maximize textual variance.

5. **Program Organization and Structural Remodeling:**
   - Inline all called functions in place or, conversely, factor out repeated code into freshly named helper functions with unrelated identifiers and nesting variations.
   - Reorder independent statements and regroup code blocks by flattening or deepening scopes, preserving exact semantic dependencies.
   - Apply unconventional but semantically valid block delimiters, statement separators, and statement groupings accepted in pseudocode.

6. **State and Flow Style Innovations:**
   - Replace mutable variables with chains of immutable rebindings or purely functional data transformations where feasible.
   - Implement control flow variations: flag variables, early/exclusive returns, exception-like flow modeled idiomatically, or continuation-passing style.
   - Use diversified return aggregation methods: tuples, data objects, accumulators passed as parameters, atypical control transfer.

7. **Formatting and Syntax Variation:**
   - Aggressively vary whitespace, indentation (spaces vs tabs, inconsistent alignments, mixed widths), blank lines, statement breaking.
   - Replace punctuation and delimiters with semantically equivalent alternatives valid in pseudocode, including changing statement separators, block tokens; remove all comments and annotations.
   - Mix imperatives and declaratives, reorder arguments in calls where order is explicitly fixed but names remain.

8. **Paradigm and Idiom Substitution:**
   - Substitute common pseudocode idioms with equivalent constructs from alternate paradigms: e.g., express loops as pattern matching, or model accumulations via monads or explicit state passing.
   - Swap explicit indexing for high-order functional constructs or pure recursion.

**Apply all transformations recursively, synergistically, and exhaustively on all code fragments and nested scopes to maximize difference while strictly preserving behavior and interface.**

**Output only the fully transformed pseudocode. Nothing else.**
