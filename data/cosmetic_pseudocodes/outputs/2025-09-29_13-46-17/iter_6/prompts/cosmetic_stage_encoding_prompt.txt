Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce an extensively transformed yet semantically equivalent version that strictly preserves all function and class names, their exact argument lists and signatures, plus the original class inheritance and containment hierarchies without adding or removing any elements. Your rewritten pseudocode must maximize dissimilarity from the original by aggressively applying a diverse, comprehensive, and recursively layered array of transformation techniques, including but not limited to:

- Reconstruct all control flow: convert loops to recursion or tail-call variants; unfold recursion into loops; replace if-else chains with guard clauses, pattern matching, dispatch tables, or boolean logic rewrites; substitute switch/case with nested conditionals or polymorphic dispatch analogues.
- Systematically rename every local variable and parameter in each scope using distinct, unrelated naming conventions (e.g., alternating between camelCase, snake_case, uppercase, thematic or arbitrary alphanumeric sets), ensuring no semantic hint or resemblance to original identifiers while never changing function/class names.
- Alter data access and iteration: interchange index-based loops, iterators, foreach constructs; convert arrays to maps, sets, or other data structures if semantically valid; transform accumulation patterns fluently between explicit loops, folds, reduces, recursion, and accumulator-passing styles.
- Reorganize and reorder independent and associative statements; rewrite logical expressions by applying Boolean algebra laws (including De Morgan’s, contrapositives, distributive, associative identities) to restructure conditions while preserving exact semantics.
- Inline function bodies or factor out repeated code into new helper subroutines with different nesting depths; arbitrarily flatten or deepen nesting to rearrange code blocks structurally.
- Rewrite all arithmetic and logical expressions through equivalent identities, expansions, factorizations, or numeric transformations (e.g., replace exponentiation with repeated multiplication loops or recursive calls, convert constants into computed expressions or symbolic intermediates).
- Reframe state management and value propagation: swap mutable variables for immutable reassignment chains or pure-functional style equivalents; alternate early returns with accumulators or control flags; change return statement structure and result aggregation logic dramatically to alter control flow and readability.
- Modify formatting aggressively and consistently: switch indentation styles (spaces vs tabs, indent widths), randomize line breaks and statement grouping, alter delimiters and punctuation within pseudocode norms, remove all comments, and vary spacing to maximize textual divergence.
- Replace idiomatic pseudocode constructs with alternative valid forms, including but not limited to using pattern matching, conditional expressions, logical short-circuiting, boolean arithmetic, higher-order constructs, or explicitly enumerated control flow.
- Combine these transformations extensively, deeply, and recursively—avoid shallow or superficial rewrites. Do not add, omit, or modify any external behavior, outputs, or functional effects.

The output must be **only** the fully rewritten pseudocode, without explanations, annotations, comments, partial snippets, or meta-discussion.

**Absolutely preserve all original function and class names and maintain their original class/object nesting and inheritance structure intact.**  
**Do not alter function signatures or class declarations in any way.**

Output exclusively the complete rewritten pseudocode.
