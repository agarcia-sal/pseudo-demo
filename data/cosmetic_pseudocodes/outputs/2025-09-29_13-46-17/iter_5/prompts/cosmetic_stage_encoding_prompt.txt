Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a completely reimagined version that is semantically and functionally identical, strictly preserving all function and class names, as well as the original class inheritance and nesting structures without any additions or deletions. Your rewritten pseudocode must maximize divergence from the original in all other respects: syntax, control flow, structure, style, naming (except function/class identifiers), and formatting. To achieve this, comprehensively apply any and all of the following transformation strategies and more, combining them creatively and deeply:

- Transform all control structures into alternative paradigms or equivalents (e.g., convert loops to recursion or iterators, recursion to loops or tail recursion, if-else chains to early returns, switch/case to nested ifs or dictionary dispatches, boolean logic to arithmetic equivalents or pattern matching where plausible).
- Rename every local variable and parameter systematically, using distinct naming conventions per scope (e.g., mix camelCase, snake_case, uppercase, thematic or mnemonic names), ensuring zero overlap or semantic hints from original names.
- Rearrange independent statements and reorder operands and conditions in logical expressions using all valid equivalences and boolean algebraic identities, including De Morgan’s laws and contrapositives, to morph condition shapes while leaving semantics intact.
- Inline functions fully or extract repeated logic blocks into helpers, varying nesting depth, and flatten or deepen control nesting arbitrarily, to produce drastically different structure.
- Change data iteration and access patterns (e.g., index-based to iterator or foreach loops, lists to maps or sets where semantically permissible), rewrite accumulation mechanisms using fold, reduce, explicit loops, or recursion interchangeably.
- Rewrite arithmetic and logical expressions using expansions, factorizations, identities, equivalent transformations, or alternative numeric formulations (for example, replace exponentiation with repeated multiplication or vice versa).
- Convert literal constants into calculated expressions, symbolic constants, or chained computations with zero semantic change.
- Alter state and value propagation patterns: substitute early returns with accumulators or vice versa, replace mutable variable updates with immutable reassignment chains, or mutable state with pure functional style equivalents.
- Restructure all return statements and result gathering logic to vary flow and clarity dramatically.
- Thoroughly vary formatting—change indentation style, spacing, line breaks, comment presence (remove all comments), delimiter styles, and line grouping—maximizing surface textual dissimilarity.
- Utilize alternative, valid pseudocode idioms, syntax variations, and constructs wherever feasible without altering semantics.
- Combine multiple transformations extensively and recursively, ensuring no trivial or superficial rewrites but deep and thorough syntactic and stylistic divergence.
- Never add or remove functionality, side effects, or outputs; keep runtime behavior identical.
- Rigidly preserve original function and class names, their arguments and signatures, and their complete original class and object containment/inheritance hierarchy.
