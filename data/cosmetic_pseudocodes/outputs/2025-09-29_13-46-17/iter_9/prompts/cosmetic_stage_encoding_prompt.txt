Given an input pseudocode snippet, produce a complete, semantically equivalent pseudocode transformation that **maximizes syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence** from the original, while strictly preserving:

- All **function and class names exactly** as given,
- Original **function signatures** (names, parameters, parameter order),
- All **class declarations, inheritance, nested and inner class structures** exactly as in the input, disallowing any addition, removal, or reordering of classes or their nesting,
- External behavior, outputs, side effects, and data semantics strictly intact,
- No addition or removal of any functions, methods, or classes.

Your output must be **only** the fully rewritten pseudocode, no explanations or comments.

To achieve maximal dissimilarity, **apply a deeply recursive, multi-stage, and cross-cutting set of transformations across all code aspects**, combining and interleaving techniques far beyond surface-level edits, including but not limited to the following categories and examples, ensuring that transformations are applied at every applicable code fragment:

1. **Control Flow Reengineering:**
   - Convert all loops to structurally equivalent recursion or iteration to recursion and back, including mutual recursion or continuation-passing style.
   - Rewrite conditionals by systematically expressing logic through diverse forms: nested if-else chains, guard clauses, early returns, switch/case desugaring, pattern matching, polymorphic dispatch, or data-driven dispatch tables.
   - Transform boolean conditions extensively leveraging equivalences: De Morgan’s transformations, contraposition, negation pushdown, re-associations, absorption, and distributive rewrites.
   - Replace flat loops with loop fusion, loop unrolling, loop splitting, or accumulation via functional fold/reduce constructs; reorder or flatten nested loops where semantics permit.

2. **Identifiers Management with Multi-Scheme Opaqueness:**
   - Rename **every local variable**, **parameter**, **temporary variable**, **iterator variable**, and **helper variable** to fresh, semantically meaningless identifiers, mixing unrelated naming schemes (random alphanumeric tokens, Unicode symbol-based names, thematic codenames, alternating casing styles, non-mnemonic glyph sequences), never reusing original names or hints.
   - Implement per-scope distinct naming maps with inconsistent styles, forbidding any semantic or mnemonic correlation with original names.
   - Retain all **function and class names** exactly as in the input without change.

3. **Data Structure and Access Pattern Diversification:**
   - Replace collections by alternative compatible types where valid (arrays ↔ lists ↔ queues ↔ sets ↔ maps), adjusting operations accordingly.
   - Alternate between index-based, iterator-based, and recursive traversal strategies, including explicit enumerations, generators, or iterator protocols.
   - Express aggregations by varying paradigms: accumulators, explicit recursions, folds, reduces, map/filter combined with recursion or iteration.

4. **Expression and Arithmetic Logic Refactoring:**
   - Mechanically rewrite all arithmetic expressions into semantically equivalent variants, e.g., replacing exponentiation with repeated multiplication (iterative or recursive), constants replaced by complex symbolic expressions or chain computations.
   - Recast boolean expressions explicitly, leveraging various normal forms and boolean arithmetic, using conditional (ternary) expressions, or rewriting via pattern matching for logical decisions.
   - Systematically reorder operators and operands exploiting algebraic and logical properties to yield maximal textual variance without altering semantics.

5. **Program Structure and Code Organization Remodeling:**
   - Inline called functions entirely or factor out repeated code patterns into newly introduced helper functions with entirely novel, unrelated names and varying nesting levels.
   - Reorder independent statements extensively and regroup code blocks by flattening deeply nested scopes or deepening flat ones, preserving semantic dependencies.
   - Alter statement grouping with non-standard block delimiters or syntactic constructs valid in pseudocode.

6. **State and Flow Management Innovations:**
   - Replace mutable state with chains of immutable reassignment or purely functional transformations where feasible.
   - Alternate control flow using flag variables, early/exclusive returns, exceptions-like flow (modeled idiomatically), or continuation-passing style.
   - Transform return value aggregation into diverse forms: tuples, objects, accumulator parameters, or data containers manipulated through atypical control flows.

7. **Formatting, Delimiters, and Syntax Variation:**
   - Aggressively vary whitespace, indentation styles (spaces vs tabs, variable widths, misaligned or staggered indentation), line breaks, and statement grouping.
   - Replace punctuation and delimiters with alternates valid in pseudocode (different end-of-line markers, statement separators, block delimiters), remove all comments, docstrings, or annotations.
   - Mix declarative and imperative statement styles, reorder parameter lists inside function calls where valid (e.g., named params kept ordered though).

8. **Idiomatic and Paradigmatic Swaps:**
   - Substitute idiomatic pseudocode constructs with their semantic equivalents from different paradigms: express loops with pattern matching, or replace next-step imperatives with declarative pipeline constructs, or model accumulations via monadic chains or explicit state passing.
   - Where code uses explicit indexing, express equivalents with higher-order functional constructs or recursion.

**Apply all transformations synergistically and recursively at all nesting depths**, maximizing complexity and minimizing surface similarity.

**Never**:

- Modify function or class names or their signatures,
- Add, remove, or reorder any functions, classes, methods, or class nesting,
- Alter the external semantics, outputs, behavior, side effects, or data structure semantics,
- Introduce any novel libraries, language constructs beyond accepted pseudocode norms,
- Include any text other than the fully rewritten pseudocode output.

Only output **the entire transformed pseudocode**. Nothing else.
