Given any input pseudocode, transform it into a complete, functionally identical pseudocode version that achieves **maximal divergence at all representation levels** from the original, subject strictly to the following constraints:

- Preserve all original **function names**, **function signatures (parameter names and order)**, and **class names** exactly as given, maintaining the **entire class hierarchy, nesting, and declaration order unchanged** — no additions, removals, or reordering.
- Ensure the transformed pseudocode exhibits full semantic equivalence: outputs, side effects, behaviors, and data semantics remain identical.
- Do **not** alter the count or modular structure of any functions, classes, or methods.
- Do **not** introduce any external libraries, novel language features beyond standard pseudocode, or explanatory comments.

Your output should be **only** the fully transformed pseudocode, nothing else.

To achieve the greatest possible syntactic, structural, and stylistic novelty, recursively apply a comprehensive, multi-faceted pipeline of deep transformations across every syntactic and semantic layer, including (but not limited to):

1. **Advanced Control Flow Remodeling:**
   - Convert all iterative loops to equivalent recursion patterns (direct, mutual, or continuation-passing style) and vice versa; arbitrarily mix and nest these forms.
   - Desugar or reconstruct all conditional logic through diverse paradigms: nested if-else ladders, guard clauses, early-exit returns, switch or case analogues, data-driven dispatch tables, pattern match-like structures, or polymorphic method dispatch.
   - Systematically rewrite all Boolean expressions with logically equivalent but syntax-distinct formulations using De Morgan’s laws, contraposition, negation distribution, associative/rearrangement rewrites, absorption laws, and canonical normal forms.
   - Apply loop fusion, fission, unrolling, splitting, or conversion into folds/reduces/map-filter recursions wherever semantics permit; reorder or flatten nested loops safely.

2. **Opaque, Cross-Paradigm Identifier Renaming:**
   - Rename every **local variable, parameter, temporary, iterator, and helper variable** to fresh, context-unique, non-meaningful names drawn from *multiple unrelated naming schemes* (e.g., randomized alphanumeric sequences, Unicode glyphs, thematic codenames, mixed casing styles, symbol sequences).
   - Implement completely independent naming maps per scope, forbidding any mnemonic or semantic hint correlations with originals or across scopes.
   - Keep **all function and class names unchanged.**

3. **Data Structure and Traversal Paradigm Variations:**
   - Swap equivalent collection types interchangeably (arrays, lists, queues, sets, maps) adapting access and iteration accordingly.
   - Vary access patterns across explicit indices, iterators/enumerators, generators with lazy evaluation, recursive descent, and explicit state-passing iteration protocols.
   - Express aggregations via alternative paradigms: explicit accumulators, recursive folding, map/filter combined with early recursion or iterative unfolds.

4. **Expression and Arithmetic Recomposition:**
   - Expand all arithmetic expressions into semantically equivalent, differently structured expressions (e.g., replace exponentiation with repeated multiplications expressed iteratively or recursively; constants unfolded into complex symbolic chains or nested computations).
   - Reformulate Boolean expressions utilizing conditional (ternary) forms, pattern matching, Boolean algebraic normal forms, or algebraic rearrangements with operator reordering and operand reassociation to maximize surface-level changes without semantic drift.

5. **Structural and Code Organization Overhaul:**
   - Inline function calls comprehensively or factor recurring code into freshly invented helper functions with novel, unrelated names at varying nesting depths.
   - Reorder all independent statements and regroup code blocks by flattening or deepening nesting arbitrarily while preserving semantic dependencies.
   - Vary block delimiters and statement grouping styles freely within pseudocode validity.

6. **State and Control-flow Innovations:**
   - Replace mutable state updates with chains of immutable rebindings or purely functional transformations where feasible.
   - Transform control flow via flag variables, early exits, exception-like constructs (modeled idiomatically in pseudocode), or continuation-passing style.
   - Recast return value aggregations into tuples, structured objects, accumulator parameters, or containerized forms traversed or manipulated via unconventional flows.

7. **Syntax, Formatting, and Punctuation Variability:**
   - Aggressively vary whitespace usage, indentation styles (spaces vs tabs, inconsistent widths, irregular alignment), line breaks, and statement separators.
   - Substitute standard punctuation or delimiters with alternate valid pseudocode symbols; remove all comments and documentation strings completely.
   - Mix declarative and imperative styles, arbitrarily reorder named parameters in calls if semantically valid.

8. **Paradigm and Idiomatic Representation Shifts:**
   - Replace imperative loops with declarative pipelines, monadic chains, or explicit state-threading where applicable.
   - Re-express explicit indexing in terms of higher-order functional constructs or recursive pattern matches.
   - Translate common idioms into their semantic counterparts from alternate paradigms—functional, declarative, continuation-passing, or automata-based styles.

Apply the above transformations **synergistically and recursively at every nesting level and syntactic fragment**, relentlessly maximizing textual, structural, and stylistic difference while guaranteeing complete semantic preservation.

**Strictly output only the fully transformed pseudocode without any explanations, comments, or additional text.**
