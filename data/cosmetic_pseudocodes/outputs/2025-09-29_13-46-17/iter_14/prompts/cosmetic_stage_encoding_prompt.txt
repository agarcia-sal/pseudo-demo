Given any input pseudocode snippet, generate a fully self-contained, semantically identical version that diverges maximally from the original pseudocode’s syntax, structure, and style, subject to these strict constraints:

- Preserve **all function and class names exactly as in the input**; no renaming or changes.
- Keep the original **function signatures intact** (names, parameter names, and their order).
- Maintain all **class declarations, inheritance, and nesting hierarchy unchanged** without additions, removals, or reorderings.
- Retain all semantic effects, outputs, side effects, and data structure meanings exactly as specified.
- Do **not** add, remove, or reorder any functions, methods, or classes.
- Do **not** introduce any new external libraries, language constructs, or extensions beyond canonical pseudocode conventions.
- The output must be **only** the transformed pseudocode, no explanations, comments, or supplementary text.

To achieve maximal syntactic and stylistic divergence, recursively apply an extensive, deep, multi-layered transformation regime incorporating these innovative strategies and aggressive permutations — thoroughly interleaved and applied across every syntactic element at all nesting levels:

1. **Advanced Control Flow Metamorphosis:**
   - Convert loops ↔ recursion ↔ continuation-passing style ↔ tail-call optimizations, including mutual recursion and trampoline-style dispatch.
   - Rewrite conditional logic exhaustively through guard clauses, inverted/negated logic, De Morgan transformations, contraposition, nested pattern-matching constructs, data-driven dispatch tables, polymorphic method calls, and cascading early-exit returns.
   - Restructure control flow to use flag variables, exception-like idioms mimicked in pseudocode, state machines, or explicit continuation objects.
   - Fuse, split, unroll, reorder, or flatten nested loops and conditionals where semantics permit.
   - Express iteration variants: index-based, iterator/generator protocols, explicit enumerations, functional folds/reductions, or higher-order recursion schemes.

2. **Radical Identifier Abstraction with Multi-Dimension Renaming:**
   - Rename **every local variable, parameter, temporary, iterator, and helper variable** distinctively, never preserving original forms or semantic hints.
   - Use unpredictable, per-scope naming styles mixing random alphanumerics, Unicode glyphs, emojis, phonetic codenames, alternating casing, obfuscation patterns, and thematic term sets — no consistent scheme or mnemonic link allowed.
   - Maintain exact original function and class names with zero alterations.

3. **Structural and Data Representation Diversification:**
   - Swap data structures among arrays, lists, sets, maps/dictionaries, queues/stacks wherever type-appropriate, adapting all related operations.
   - Vary element access patterns: recursive traversal, iterators, indexed access, streaming generators, manual enumerations.
   - Express aggregations or accumulations with diverse paradigms: explicit recursive folding, map/filter chains, accumulator passing, or monadic-style state threading.

4. **Expression, Boolean, and Arithmetic Recasting:**
   - Re-express arithmetic calculations using equivalent but less common formulations (e.g., exponentiation via recursive multiplication, constants replaced by computed expressions or identity expansions).
   - Rewrite boolean expressions extensively through selected normal forms (CNF, DNF), boolean algebra identities, conditional expressions (ternary), and pattern-matching alternatives.
   - Reorder and regroup operators and operands systematically exploiting algebraic and logical equivalences to create maximal difference with identical effect.

5. **Program Organization and Code Modularization Overhaul:**
   - Inline called functions selectively or extract repeated code snippets into newly named helpers with unrelated, fresh identifiers.
   - Rearrange statements and code blocks whenever semantically safe, flatten deeply nested blocks or add controlled extra nesting.
   - Replace common block delimiters with alternate pseudocode-legal symbols or indentation styles, vary line breaks, whitespace, and statement terminators aggressively.

6. **State, Side-Effect, and Return Handling Innovations:**
   - Replace mutable variable updates with successive immutable reassignments or purely functional style transformations.
   - Model alternate control flows with flags, early-return chains, explicit state machines, or continuation-passing styles.
   - Convert return value collections into alternative grouped structures: tuples, records, objects, accumulators passed as parameters, or containerized forms.

7. **Syntactic and Formatting Variation Spectrum:**
   - Apply diverse indentation techniques (tabs vs spaces, varying widths, staggered or misaligned indentations).
   - Vary punctuation and line delimiters (end-of-line markers, statement separators), omit all comments and annotations systematically.
   - Switch between imperative and declarative styles, reorder arguments internally only if signature order remains intact.

8. **Paradigmatic and Idiomatic Style Switching:**
   - Substitute idiomatic pseudocode constructs with semantic equivalents from functional, imperative, or declarative paradigms.
   - Replace explicit iteration with recursive, pattern-matching, pipeline, monadic chaining, or continuation-passing constructions.
   - Express indexing via recursion or iterator protocols where applicable.

**Enforce comprehensive recursive application of these transformations at every syntax node depth to maximize overall distance from the input pseudocode.**

**Never break:**  
- Preservation of function/class names and signatures,  
- External behavior and data semantics,  
- The quantity and nesting order of all classes, functions, and methods,  
- Pseudocode validity and accepted constructs,  
- Output exclusivity to the fully rewritten pseudocode itself.

Only output the complete transformed pseudocode. Nothing else.
