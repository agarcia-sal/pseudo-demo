Given input pseudocode, produce a fully rewritten pseudocode that is logically identical but differs as extensively as possible in syntax, structure, style, and presentation from the original. Your transformation must obey these strict constraints without exception:

- **Keep all function names, class names, and method names exactly as originally given.**
- **Preserve all function signatures**—parameter names and their order remain unchanged.
- Maintain all **class declarations, inheritance relations, nesting, and inner structure precisely as in the input**, without any addition, removal, or reordering of classes or methods.
- Preserve the exact external semantics: outputs, behavior, side effects, data representations, and state effects must not change.
- No new functions, classes, or methods may be added or removed, nor may existing ones be reordered.
- Your output must contain **only the resultant pseudocode**, without any explanation, comments, notes, or annotations.

To achieve maximal dissimilarity to the original pseudocode, apply an aggressive, deeply recursive, and layered combination of advanced refactorings, mixing these categories and techniques _simultaneously_ and at _all nesting levels_, ensuring pervasive divergence:

1. **Control Flow Transformations and Decomposition:**
   - Replace all loop constructs by recursive equivalents; or convert recursion back into iteration; use mutually recursive helper functions and continuation-passing style where applicable.
   - Rewrite conditionals into alternative structural forms: nested if-else chains, early-exit guard clauses, switch/case desugaring, pattern matching, polymorphic dispatch, or table-driven branching.
   - Completely rewrite logical conditions by systematically applying Boolean algebra laws: De Morgan’s theorems, contraposition, distributivity, absorption, negation pushing, double-negations, and normal forms.
   - Decompose or combine loops—fuse or split loops, unroll loops partially or fully, reorder or flatten nested loops if semantics allow.
   - Encode state transitions via explicit state machines or state-passing arguments rather than implicit mutable variables.

2. **Opaque and Multi-Modal Renaming:**
   - Rename all **local variables, parameters, temporary variables, iterators, accumulators, and helper variables** with deliberately opaque, unrelated, and mixed-style identifiers: random strings (alphanumeric and Unicode), thematic codenames, alternating casing, nonsensical glyphs, or obfuscated tokens.
   - Assign per-scope distinct naming conventions and never preserve mnemonic hints nor relationships to original names.
   - Retain all **function, method, and class names verbatim**, strictly unmodified.

3. **Data Structure and Access Pattern Reconfiguration:**
   - Substitute all collection types with valid equivalents: arrays ↔ lists ↔ queues ↔ sets ↔ maps/maps with keys converted to tuples, or vice versa; adjust access, iteration, and mutation accordingly.
   - Vary traversal strategies extensively: index loops, iterator-based loops, recursive decompositions, generator-like constructions, or explicit enumerations.
   - Express data aggregations and reductions using multiple paradigms—folds, reduces, scans, accumulators, map/filter compositions combined with recursion or iteration.
   - Convert fixed-size collections to infinite generators with explicit termination conditions, or switch between eager and lazy evaluation idioms.

4. **Expression and Logic Refactoring to Algebraic Normal Forms:**
   - Mechanically transform all arithmetic into semantically equivalent but syntactically novel forms: replace exponentiation by repeated multiplication (iterative or recursive), replace constants by elaborated expressions or calculated sequences.
   - Re-express all Boolean expressions via alternate normal forms (CNF, DNF), Boolean arithmetic, ternary conditional expressions, pattern matching constructs, or branching expressions.
   - Reorder and re-associate operands applying commutativity, associativity, distributivity to maximize textual difference without semantic change.
   - Replace direct constants and literals with computed equivalents (expressions, defining functions, or data-driven lookups).

5. **Program and Structural Organization Remodeling:**
   - Inline called functions at call-sites or factor out repeated code into novel helper functions with unrelated randomly generated names.
   - Deeply reorder, regroup, and flatten or deepen code blocks and statements as dependencies permit, including altering block delimiters valid in pseudocode.
   - Replace conventional blocks with alternate syntactic constructs, mixing declarative and imperative styles.
   - Vary expression statement boundaries and insertion of no-op or identity operations harmlessly but altering shape.

6. **State Mutation and Flow Control Innovation:**
   - Replace mutable variables with immutable rebinding patterns or functional transformations where possible.
   - Implement flow control via flags, state objects, continuation-passing style, exceptions modeled idiomatically, or exclusive/early returns.
   - Transform accumulators and return values into tuples, objects, or containers passed along as explicit parameters.
   - Simulate side effects or outputs via passed-in handlers or result-collecting parameters rather than direct mutation.

7. **Pseudocode Syntax and Formatting Diversity:**
   - Aggressively alter whitespace, indentation schemes (spaces, tabs, mixed widths, misalignments), line breaks, and statement grouping.
   - Vary delimiters and punctuation: switch among ; , newline endings, different block start/end keywords, braces, or indentation-based nesting wherever pseudocode permits.
   - Remove all comments, annotations, or docstrings.
   - Randomize parameter list layouts within allowed constraints (e.g., named parameters maintain order).
   - Mix spelling variants of pseudocode keywords, alternate casing.

8. **Paradigm and Idiomatic Shifts:**
   - Replace imperative loops with declarative constructs (map/filter/reduce pipelines), or express via pattern matching or algebraic data types.
   - Model state passing via monadic or functor-like chaining, explicit environment objects, or callback continuations.
   - Translate indexing-based data access into pattern-matching or recursive destructuring where semantics allow.

Apply _all_ these transformations holistically and recursively _to every applicable code fragment_, regardless of depth or nesting, to generate a version that is maximally distinct textually and structurally from the original pseudocode, while guaranteeing full behavioral equivalence.

**Output only the complete resulting pseudocode, strictly no explanations or commentary.**
