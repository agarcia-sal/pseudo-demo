Given the original pseudocode as input, produce a rewritten version that preserves **all** original semantics and functionality exactly, including keeping all function and class names **identical** and maintaining the same class/object hierarchy **unchanged**, but transforms the code into an entirely different pseudocode style and structure by:  
- Using alternate control flow constructs (e.g., replace loops with recursion or vice versa)  
- Modifying variable naming styles while keeping function/class identifiers intact  
- Changing the order and style of expressions and statements  
- Replacing explicit control structures with equivalent but syntactically different ones  
- Utilizing different indentation and formatting conventions  
- Rephrasing conditions and arithmetic operations in varied but equivalent ways  
- Unfolding or folding expressions without altering logic  
- Varying the way data structures are manipulated and iterated over  
- Simplifying or reorganizing code blocks while maintaining behavior  

**Output only the rewritten pseudocode without any explanations, comments, or additional text.**  
All function and class names must remain exactly as in the input pseudocode, with the original class and object hierarchy preserved.
