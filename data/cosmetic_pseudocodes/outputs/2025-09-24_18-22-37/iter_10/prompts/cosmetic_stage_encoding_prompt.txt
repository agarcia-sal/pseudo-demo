Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally equivalent version that, for every possible input, produces exactly the same outputs, side effects, control structures, logic, and intermediate computations with zero semantic deviation. Preserve **all original function names, class names, method signatures, and the full class-object hierarchy without any renaming, reordering, or structural alteration**.

Your rewritten pseudocode output must contain only the pseudocode itself—no explanations, comments, annotations, or formatting markup—and adhere to valid pseudocode formatting.

To achieve maximal semantic-preserving divergence from the input pseudocode, comprehensively apply and mix the following advanced transformations in a consistent, coherent, and intelligent manner throughout the entire code:

1. **Local Variable and Parameter Renaming:**  
   Consistently rename all local variables, parameters, and temporary identifiers to fresh, unrelated names that bear no resemblance to the originals, while preserving all original references. Do not rename any function names, class names, or global identifiers.

2. **Control Flow Modernization and Reorganization:**  
   - Convert loops freely between FOR, WHILE, and DO-WHILE styles using logically equivalent constructs, including changing increment/decrement styles and boundary checks.  
   - Restructure conditional logic by transforming IF-ELSE chains into SWITCH-CASE where applicable and vice versa; flatten nested conditionals into guard clauses; deepen simple conditions by introducing nested if-statements; reorder independent conditional branches freely.  
   - Alter control flow by introducing early returns, consolidating multiple return points into one, or vice versa, so long as behavioral equivalence is perfectly maintained.

3. **Statement and Expression Reordering:**  
   - When semantic independence permits, reorder unrelated statements and computations arbitrarily within scopes.  
   - Break down complex expressions into sequences of multiple intermediate assignments or merge simple assignments into compound expressions; introduce helper temporaries when it enhances divergence.  
   - Consistently apply alternative arithmetic and logical operator expressions (e.g., replace `!=` with `not equal to`, use synonyms like `plus` instead of `+`, use symbolic logical operators like `∧` for AND) including varied data access syntax (`array[index]` ↔ `array.at(index)`).  
   - Express numeric literals differently but equivalently (e.g., `0b101` ↔ `5`), but only when it guarantees exact behavioral parity.

4. **Data Structure and Iteration Style Variation:**  
   - Swap index-based loops for value-based iterations or iterators and vice versa.  
   - Traverse data structures in logically equivalent but syntactically diverse manners (e.g., forward, backward, or using alternative idioms).  
   - Within safe semantic boundaries, reorder independent data accesses and updates.

5. **Strict Structural Integrity:**  
   - Maintain all original function and class names, signatures, and hierarchies **unchanged**, with no reordering.  
   - Preserve all expected loop and conditional boundaries.  
   - Keep original algorithmic stepwise behavior intact, avoiding substitutions with built-in shortcuts or semantic simplifications.

6. **Formatting and Styling Randomization:**  
   - Randomize whitespace, line breaks, indentation styles, and code grouping (expand inline statements to multi-line, or inline multi-statements where trivial), increasing syntactical variety.  
   - Ensure final pseudocode remains valid and clear within acceptable pseudocode conventions.

7. **Consistent New Alias Management:**  
   - Any introduced temporaries or helpers must have unique, consistently used new names with no reuse or shadowing, maintaining clarity and unambiguous reference.

Produce a final rewritten pseudocode that is structurally, lexically, and stylistically as dissimilar as possible from the original input code, while guaranteeing provable behavioral equivalence under all inputs.

Output **only** the rewritten pseudocode with no additional text or explanation.
