Transform the given input pseudocode into a semantically identical but superficially and structurally distinct version, ensuring that the output:

- Produces exactly the same results and side effects for every possible input, with no change in behavior, logic, control flow, or intermediate computations.
- Retains all original function names, class names, and the full class-object hierarchy exactly as in the input, including their signatures and organizational structure—no renaming or reordering of these global identifiers.
- Only outputs valid pseudocode text with no added explanations, comments, formatting marks, or any content beyond the rewritten pseudocode.

To achieve maximal syntactic, stylistic, and structural divergence while guaranteeing perfect functional equivalence, comprehensively and systematically apply a combination of these advanced transformations—mixing and nesting them freely throughout the pseudocode:

1. **Consistent and thorough renaming of all local variables and parameters:**  
   Replace all local variable and parameter names with fresh, unrelated identifiers consistently everywhere they occur, carefully avoiding any global or structural names like functions or classes.

2. **Aggressive control flow restructuring and normalization:**  
   - Convert any kind of loops (FOR, WHILE, DO-WHILE, REPEAT-UNTIL) into alternative loop constructs with equivalent logic, potentially introducing or eliminating loop variables and changing condition evaluation points.  
   - Transform conditionals by interchanging IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH-CASE blocks or vice versa; flatten nested conditions into separate guards or deeply nest simple conditions; reorder logically independent branches and conditions arbitrarily without semantic impact.  
   - Introduce early returns or consolidate multiple return points into a single exit point, as long as it does not affect semantics.  
   - Re-express boolean expressions using De Morgan’s laws, double negations, or alternative logical operator synonyms (e.g., “AND” vs “∧”, “OR” vs “∨”), preserving logic perfectly.

3. **Reordering and regrouping of independent statements:**  
   Analyze data and control dependencies precisely to reorder independent statements, assignments, and computations freely, including splitting or merging multiple steps into intermediate expressions or compound statements, as long as the execution order of dependent statements is preserved.

4. **Rich expression transformations:**  
   - Expand complex arithmetic or logical expressions into equivalent sequences of simpler intermediate variables and assignments, or combine sequential simple assignments into compound expressions with temporary variables.  
   - Replace arithmetic and logical operators consistently with equivalent verbal or symbolic synonyms (e.g., ‘not equal to’ instead of “!=”, plus, minus, increment by, decrement by).  
   - Alternate data access syntax styles where valid (e.g., array[index] ↔ array.at(index), object.property ↔ object->property), ensuring both forms are behaviorally identical.  
   - Change numeric literal formats where exactly equivalent (e.g., decimal to binary or hexadecimal), provided no ambiguity or semantic change results.

5. **Diverse iteration and data structure idioms:**  
   - Switch between index-based and element-based looping idioms, such as iterating over indices versus iterating over values directly, including forward, backward, or stepwise traversal variants that produce equivalent sequences.  
   - Reorder independent data accesses or computations within loop bodies safely to alter flow without affecting correctness.

6. **Strict preservation of high-level structural integrity:**  
   - Do not rename or rearrange any function or class names or their positions within the class-object hierarchy—preserve exact signatures and nesting.  
   - Preserve loop and conditional boundaries exactly (e.g., iteration ranges, condition scopes).  
   - Avoid semantic shortcuts or simplifications such as built-in aggregation shortcuts, library-specific calls, or algorithmic shortcuts that change stepwise behavior or intermediate states.

7. **Deliberate formatting and stylistic variation:**  
   - Vary indentation, line breaking, grouping, inlining vs multiline statement expansions arbitrarily, within valid pseudocode conventions.  
   - Insert or remove trivial grouping parentheses or line breaks to increase syntactic variety.  
   - Use consistent but non-repetitive naming for introduced temporaries or helper variables to avoid ambiguity.

The output must be solely pseudocode text fulfilling these criteria, with no explanations, comments, markdown, or additional content.

Your goal is to generate output that is provably behaviorally equivalent yet as lexically, structurally, and stylistically distinct as possible from the input pseudocode, maximizing divergence while eliminating all errors or semantic changes.
