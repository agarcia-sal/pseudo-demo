Rewrite the given pseudocode into a semantically identical, yet maximally transformed version that preserves its exact behavior, outputs, side effects, function names, class names, and full class-object hierarchy with all signatures and boundaries exactly intact. Produce only the rewritten pseudocode text—no explanations, comments, delimiters, or extraneous content.

Your transformation must include, but is not limited to, the following, applied in arbitrary, mixed, and aggressive combinations:

- Rename all local variables and parameters to fresh, unrelated identifiers consistently and uniquely throughout each scope. Do not rename any global names, function names, class names, or the structural hierarchy.

- Restructure all control flow aggressively: replace all FOR loops with WHILE loops or vice versa; convert IF-ELSE chains into SWITCH-CASE statements, nested guards, or flattened boolean logic; reorder independent conditional branches; replace return statements with early returns or consolidated exits; split or merge conditional blocks without altering logic.

- Change the order of statements, computations, and expressions wherever data dependencies allow, including reordering independent operations and re-organizing statement grouping.

- Transform all expressions by fully expanding compound operations into multiple simple steps or collapsing sequences into fewer compound expressions; substitute equivalent logical, arithmetic, or comparison operators with synonyms or alternate formulations (e.g., “!=” ↔ “NOT EQUAL TO”, AND ↔ ∧); alternate data access patterns (e.g., `array[index]` ↔ `array.at(index)` or `get_element(array, index)` where valid); represent numeric literals in different, equivalent ways (e.g., decimal, hexadecimal, additive decompositions).

- Vary iteration and traversal strategies for data structures exhaustively: swap index-based loops for element-based loops and vice versa; reverse iteration direction when semantic preservation allows; change iteration order or use explicit iterators, indices, or ranged loops arbitrarily.

- Introduce new temporary variables, helper variables, or intermediate steps as needed to break down or recombine expressions and control flow, ensuring clear and consistent use without naming clashes.

- Apply arbitrary formatting variation including inconsistent or randomized indentation, line breaks, spacing, and statement grouping, consistent with valid pseudocode syntax.

Strictly forbid any introduction of semantic shortcuts, algorithmic simplifications, built-in function replacements that shortcut explicit computations, or any changes to the stepwise logic and behavior. All function and class interfaces, names, hierarchy, and object boundaries must be preserved exactly as in the input.

Your output must be a plain, fully rewritten pseudocode snippet that is as lexically, syntactically, structurally, and stylistically distinct from the original as possible, while being functionally equivalent. Output only this rewritten pseudocode text.
