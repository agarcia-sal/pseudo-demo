Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that is functionally identical in every detail: it must preserve all outputs, side effects, logic, and algorithmic behavior exactly, including the original function and class names and their full class-object hierarchies without any change. The output must be exclusively valid pseudocode text—no explanations, comments, annotations, markdown formatting, or extraneous text.

To create the maximally distinct yet semantically equivalent pseudocode, apply at least the following comprehensive transformation strategies consistently throughout the entire input:

1. **Systematic and consistent renaming:** Rename all variables, parameters, and temporary identifiers to new, unrelated names—uniformly across all their occurrences to maintain correctness.

2. **Control flow restructuring:** Replace all loops and conditional constructs with logically equivalent alternatives, for example:  
   - Convert FOR-loops to WHILE-loops and vice versa.  
   - Replace IF/ELSE with SWITCH/CASE or nested IF/ELSE chains.  
   - Introduce or eliminate early returns and guard clauses to flatten or deepen nesting, as long as semantic equivalence holds.

3. **Statement and expression reordering:** Reorder independent or commutative statements and computations without altering the final results.

4. **Expression decomposition and consolidation:** Break down complex expressions into multiple simpler assignment steps, or merge sequential assignments into compound expressions, while preserving semantics.

5. **Operator and syntax variation:** Use alternative syntactic forms and synonyms for assignments (e.g., “:=” vs “=”), logical and comparison operators (e.g., “is equal to”, “==”, “≠”, “not equal to”), arithmetic operations (e.g., “plus”, “+”, “increment by”), and data access (e.g., bracket vs dot notation if applicable).

6. **Data structure and control constructs idiomatic variation:** Modify how data structures are traversed or manipulated without changing their meaning (e.g., iterate using indices versus iterators), reorder data access operations when safe.

7. **Whitespace and formatting changes:** Vary indentation schemes, line breaks, spacing, and grouping within the bounds of valid pseudocode formatting rules.

8. **Preserve all conditional and loop boundaries, all method signatures, class structures, and hierarchy:** absolutely do not rename or alter function names, class names, or their positions in the object/class structure.

9. **No removal or semantic simplification:** Avoid replacing logic with mathematically simplified or built-in shortcuts that would alter the algorithm’s step-by-step structure or effect.

The goal is to produce pseudocode text that is syntactically, structurally, and stylistically radically different from the original input, while remaining provably behaviorally equivalent. Output only the pseudocode—nothing else.
