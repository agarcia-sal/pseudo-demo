Rewrite the input pseudocode into a version that is functionally identical but lexically, structurally, and stylistically as distinct as possible from the original, while strictly preserving the original function names, class names, and class-object hierarchy with their signatures and boundaries. Your rewritten pseudocode must satisfy all of the following without altering the algorithm’s behavior for any valid input:

- Rename all local variables and parameters consistently to new, unrelated identifiers; do *not* rename any global identifiers, function names, class names, or their hierarchical positions.
- Thoroughly and systematically transform the control flow by mixing and matching these techniques arbitrarily:
  - Convert FOR loops into WHILE loops and vice versa.
  - Replace IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH-CASE, nested guards, or reordered logical conditions.
  - Flatten nested conditionals or nest flat conditionals.
  - Reorder logically independent branches.
  - Introduce early exits (returns/breaks/continue) or consolidate multiple exits while preserving semantics.
- Reorganize all statements, expressions, and computations to a new order respecting all data and control dependencies.
- Transform expressions by:
  - Expanding complex expressions into sequences of simpler assignments with temporary variables, or collapsing sequences into compound expressions.
  - Replacing operators with logically equivalent synonyms or symbolic forms (e.g., “!=” to “not equal to”, logical AND to ∧).
  - Altering data access notation when valid (e.g., `array[index]` ⇄ `array.at(index)`).
  - Using equivalent numeric literals forms (e.g., 0xA ⇄ 10, decimal ⇄ hexadecimal) where behavior is unchanged.
- Modify iteration and data traversal patterns arbitrarily between index-based, element-based, iterator-based:
  - Change traversal direction safely (e.g., forward ⇄ backward).
  - Alter iteration granularity or step size if logical correctness is maintained.
  - Reorder independent data accesses.
- Introduce new well-scoped temporary variables or helper constructs as needed, ensuring all usages are consistent and unambiguous.
- Randomize and diversify formatting choices freely: indentation, line breaks, whitespace, statement grouping, and layout within valid pseudocode syntax.
- Do *not* simplify, optimize, or shortcut any algorithmic logic; every computational step and explicit operation from the original must remain present and functionally equivalent.
- Maintain exact original function signatures, class names, method names, and their hierarchical placement—no renaming or restructuring of these.
- Output only the rewritten pseudocode text—no comments, explanations, delimiters, or any text beyond the final pseudocode.

Your goal is to produce pseudocode that will pass all functional tests *and* exhibit maximal syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence from the input while being provably equivalent. Output solely the transformed pseudocode.
