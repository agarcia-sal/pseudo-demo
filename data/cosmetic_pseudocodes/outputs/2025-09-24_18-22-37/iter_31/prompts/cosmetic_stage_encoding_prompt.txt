Rewrite the input pseudocode into a new version that is functionally identical—producing exactly the same outputs, side effects, and behavior for all valid inputs—while being as lexically, syntactically, structurally, and stylistically distinct as possible from the original. Strictly preserve all function and class names, as well as the entire class hierarchy and object structure with their original signatures and boundaries intact (i.e., no renaming or restructuring of these). Your transformed pseudocode must adhere to all of the following:

- Rename all *local variables and parameters* with fresh, unrelated, consistently applied new names throughout; global identifiers, function names, class names, and the class-object hierarchy must remain unchanged.
- Systematically alter control flow by applying arbitrary combinations of transformations such as: swapping FOR and WHILE loops; converting IF-ELSE into SWITCH-CASE or nested guards (or vice versa); flattening nested conditionals or introducing nested conditionals for flattening; reordering independent conditional branches; replacing multiple returns with single consolidated return points or introducing early returns, without altering semantics.
- Reorder independent statements, expressions, and computations whenever data dependencies allow.
- Thoroughly transform expressions by breaking down complex expressions into sequences of simpler assignments or consolidating several assignments into compound expressions; replace operators by logically equivalent alternatives or synonyms (e.g., “!=” ⇄ “not equal to”; logical AND ⇄ ∧; array[index] ⇄ array.at(index) when allowed); vary numeric literal formats without changing computed values (e.g., 10 ⇄ 5*2, 0xA ⇄ 10).
- Vary data structure traversal methods extensively by translating index-based loops into element-based iterations and vice versa; reverse or shuffle iteration directions as permissible; reorder data accesses when dependencies allow.
- Introduce new temporary helper variables or intermediate constructs as needed to maximize structural difference while avoiding ambiguity or inconsistent reuse.
- Randomize formatting rigorously—vary indentation, line breaks, grouping, and whitespace freely within valid pseudocode syntax.
- Never apply any algorithmic shortcuts, optimizations, semantic simplifications, or use built-in/library shortcuts that shortcut explicit operations or change stepwise computations.
- Avoid any changes to function/class signatures, names, or their relative positions within hierarchies.
- The output must be *only* the rewritten pseudocode text—no explanations, comments, delimiters, markdown formatting, or anything else.

Your objective is to maximize semantic fidelity combined with maximal lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic diversity from the input pseudocode, thus generating a version that passes strict correctness tests but looks radically different from the original. Output exclusively the transformed pseudocode.
