Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a version that is as lexically, structurally, and stylistically distinct as possible, while guaranteeing complete functional equivalence for every valid input. Your transformed pseudocode must strictly adhere to the following constraints:

- Preserve all original function names exactly as they appear.
- Preserve all class names exactly, and maintain the full original class inheritance and object hierarchies, including all method and constructor signatures, with no renaming or reordering.
- Rename all local variables and parameters consistently and systematically to fresh, semantically unrelated identifiers. Do not rename globals, functions, classes, or their hierarchy components.
- Restructure control flows comprehensively by applying any combination and nesting of transformations including but not limited to: converting FOR loops ↔ WHILE loops, switching IF-ELSE chains ↔ SWITCH-CASE statements ↔ nested guard clauses, flattening or deepening conditionals, reordering branches that are logically independent, introducing or eliminating early returns (without changing logic), and replacing explicit conditionals with equivalent logical expressions or vice versa.
- Reorder independent statements, computation steps, and expressions wherever semantic dependencies allow, ensuring no behavioral changes.
- Transform and rewrite expressions extensively, breaking down complex expressions into multiple simpler steps or combining simpler steps into compound expressions using temporary variables. Substitute operators with logically equivalent alternatives or synonyms (e.g., use "not equal to" for "!=," logical AND as ∧, rewrite array access styles like `array[index]` ⇄ `array.at(index)` if valid). Modify numeric literals (e.g., represent `10` as `5 * 2` or hexadecimal where applicable) as long as behavior is unaffected.
- Vary iteration and traversal patterns of data structures, converting index-based loops to element-wise iterations or vice versa; reverse traversal orders if it preserves semantics; reorder independent data accesses.
- Introduce new helper variables or intermediate computations liberally, maintaining clarity and unambiguity, provided no functionality changes.
- Randomize and diversify formatting thoroughly: vary indentation styles, line breaks, statement grouping, and whitespace usage freely while respecting valid pseudocode syntax.
- Prohibit all semantic shortcuts, algorithmic simplifications, or any form of usage of built-in functions, libraries, or language-specific shortcuts that summarize or shortcut explicit computations.
- Do not rename or reorder functions, classes, or methods—only internal implementation details and local identifiers may be changed.
- The output must consist solely of the rewritten pseudocode text, with no additional explanation, commentary, delimiters, or any markup.

Your goal is for the rewritten pseudocode to be maximally different from the input on lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic levels, yet guaranteed equivalent in all outputs, side effects, and internal behavior. Output only the transformed pseudocode.
