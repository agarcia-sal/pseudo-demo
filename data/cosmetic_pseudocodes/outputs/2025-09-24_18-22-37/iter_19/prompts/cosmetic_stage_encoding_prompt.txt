Rewrite the given pseudocode into an output that is functionally identical in every respect—producing exactly the same outputs, side effects, and behavior on all valid inputs—while being maximally transformed and distinct from the original in all lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic dimensions. Your rewritten pseudocode must strictly adhere to the following constraints and transformations:

- Preserve all original function names, class names, method names, and their full hierarchies including class-object relationships and method signatures exactly as given; do **not** rename or reorder these global identifiers or hierarchy structures.

- Rename **only** all local variables, function parameters, and any newly introduced temporary or helper variables to fresh, unrelated, consistent identifiers within each scope to eliminate lexical similarity.

- Restructure control flow aggressively by arbitrarily mixing and combining, for example: switching between all loop types allowed (FOR, WHILE, REPEAT), transforming IF-ELSE chains into SWITCH-CASE or nested guards, flattening nested conditionals or nesting flat ones, reordering independent conditional branches, substituting early returns for delayed returns or vice versa—provided the original logic and observable behavior remain unchanged.

- Reorder independent statements, expressions, and computations freely wherever their execution order does not affect semantics. Break complex expressions into sequences of simpler assignments or merge simple statements into compound expressions using temporary variables. Substitute operators with synonymous or logically equivalent forms (e.g., `!=` ↔ `NOT EQUAL TO`, logical AND ↔ ∧). Change data access syntax validly (`array[index]` ⇄ `array.at(index)`) and vary numerical literal representations (e.g., decimal ↔ hexadecimal, explicit negative numbers).

- Vary iteration and data traversal idioms extensively and arbitrarily wherever semantics allow: switch between index-based, iterator-based, element-based, forward and backward traversals; reorder iterations of independent elements or substructures; convert recursion to iteration or iteration to recursion only if this preserves exact stepwise semantics.

- Maintain **all** stepwise computational detail without incorporating any semantic shortcuts, algorithmic simplifications, or built-in/library shortcuts that would alter stepwise behavior or optimize away explicit computations. Do not collapse loops, remove variables, or replace multiple steps with a single call unless the original explicitly does so.

- Randomize formatting, indentation, line breaks, statement grouping, and whitespace styles freely within valid pseudocode syntax to maximize syntactic diversity.

- Introduce additional helper variables, intermediate assignments, or control-flow labels as needed to vary structure, naming them consistently and unambiguously without conflicts.

- Output only the transformed pseudocode text exactly (no explanations, comments, delimiters, or additional text).

Your goal is that the resulting pseudocode is provably functionally equivalent but lexically, syntactically, structurally, and stylistically as far removed as possible from the original, maximizing divergence while guaranteeing correctness. The output must be valid pseudocode replicating the original logic verbatim and respecting naming and hierarchy constraints as described. Output just the transformed pseudocode.
