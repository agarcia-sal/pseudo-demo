Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that is functionally identical but differs drastically in terms of syntax, phrasing, control flow, variable naming, and structural style. Preserve exactly all original function names, class names, and their object/class hierarchy without alteration. Avoid any explanatory text or commentary in the output; provide only the rewritten pseudocode. Aim to maximize syntactic and stylistic divergence while ensuring unambiguous equivalence in logic and output.
