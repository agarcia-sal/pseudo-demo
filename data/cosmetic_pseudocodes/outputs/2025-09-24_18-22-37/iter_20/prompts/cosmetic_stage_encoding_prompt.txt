Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that is functionally identical—producing the same outputs, side effects, and behavior for all valid inputs—while diverging as much as possible in lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic aspects.

Your rewritten pseudocode must adhere to these strict conditions:

1. Preserve all function names, class names, and the complete class-object hierarchy with their full signatures and boundaries exactly as in the original pseudocode. Do not rename or reorder these global or structural identifiers.

2. Rename all local variables and parameter names thoroughly using fresh, unrelated, consistently used identifiers that do not clash with any global names or preserved identifiers.

3. Completely restructure control flow by applying diverse and combined transformations, such as:
   - Converting FOR loops to WHILE loops and vice versa.
   - Replacing IF-ELSE constructs by SWITCH-CASE, nested guards, or early returns.
   - Flattening nested conditionals or nesting flat conditionals.
   - Reordering logically independent branches or statements without changing semantics.
   - Introducing or consolidating multiple return points without altering behavior.

4. Rigorously reorder any independent statements, computations, or expressions where data and control dependencies permit.

5. Transform expressions extensively:
   - Expand complex expressions into multiple simpler intermediate assignments or collapse successive assignments into compound expressions using temporary variables.
   - Substitute operators with synonyms or logically equivalent forms (e.g., replace “!=” with “NOT EQUAL TO”, logical AND with ∧, logical OR with ∨).
   - Alternate data access patterns safely (e.g., `array[index]` ⇄ `array.at(index)` or iterator-based access).
   - Change numeric literals into semantically equivalent variants (e.g., decimal to hexadecimal or explicit equivalent arithmetic expressions).

6. Vary data structure traversal and iteration idioms:
   - Switch between index-based looping and element-based iteration.
   - Change iteration order and direction where it does not affect correctness.
   - Rearrange independent data accesses and update sequences accordingly.

7. Introduce new temporary variables, helper assignments, or minor internal constructs as needed, ensuring clarity and unambiguity while increasing lexical and structural divergence.

8. Preserve all algorithmic steps, logical decisions, and procedural computations exactly, strictly forbidding any semantic shortcut, simplification, or optimization that changes the stepwise behavior or computational complexity. Also forbid using shorthand built-in functions or library methods that shortcut explicit computations.

9. Randomize syntactic formatting freely, including indentation style, line breaks, blank lines, statement grouping, and whitespace usage, so the rewritten pseudocode is stylistically distinct yet valid.

10. Your output must be only the rewritten pseudocode text—without any explanations, comments, delimiters, or extraneous content.

The goal is to produce rewritten pseudocode that is maximally transformed across all code dimensions—naming, structure, control flow, expressions, traversal style, and formatting—but provably equivalent in all functional and behavioral aspects, while preserving all interface and structural identifiers intact.

Output only this rewritten pseudocode.
