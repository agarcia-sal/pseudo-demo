Rewrite the input pseudocode into a semantically equivalent yet maximally distinct version, preserving all original functionality exactly: the generated pseudocode must produce the same outputs, side effects, intermediate computations, and control flow for every possible input with zero deviation.

Strictly maintain all function names, class names, and the complete class-object hierarchy intact without renaming or restructuring them.

Your output must be solely the rewritten pseudocode, without any explanations, commentary, annotations, or formatting decorations—no markdown, no comments, and no extra text.

To achieve maximal syntactic, lexical, structural, and stylistic divergence while guaranteeing perfect behavioral equivalence, apply *comprehensive and consistent* transformations including (but not limited to) the following:

1. **Variable and parameter renaming:**  
   Rename every local variable and parameter systematically with fresh, unrelated, consistent names throughout the code.  
   Do *not* rename global identifiers such as function or class names.

2. **Control flow transformations:**  
   - Convert any loop forms (FOR ↔ WHILE ↔ REPEAT-UNTIL) as appropriate, recreating equivalent logic with creative loop conditions, counters, and iteration steps.  
   - Refactor conditionals: interchange IF-ELSE chains with SWITCH-CASE blocks; flatten or deepen nested conditions; reorder logically independent branches; replace nested conditionals with guard clauses or vice versa.  
   - Restructure function exit points: use early returns, consolidate multiple return statements into single exit points, or the reverse—provided semantic invariance is preserved.

3. **Statement and computation reordering:**  
   Identify and arbitrarily reorder statements and assignments that are independent (no data/control dependencies), ensuring semantic correctness.

4. **Expression rewriting:**  
   - Decompose complex expressions into sequential, simpler intermediate assignments or fold sequences of simple assignments into compound expressions.  
   - Substitute operators with synonymous alternatives and equivalent logical/arithmetic expressions (e.g., use descriptive terms like “increment by”, “difference”, “not equal to” in place of symbols).  
   - Alternate data access syntax where valid (e.g., `array[index]` ↔ `array.at(index)`) without changing behavior.  
   - Rewrite numeric literals in alternate exact forms (binary, decimal, hexadecimal) as allowed.

5. **Iteration and data structure idioms:**  
   Swap between index-based, element-based, or iterator-based traversals whenever these present behaviorally equivalent alternatives; traverse data structures in different valid orders that preserve semantic correctness.

6. **Maintain structural and interface fidelity:**  
   - Preserve all function and method signatures exactly, including parameters and return types.  
   - Do not rename or reorder function names, class names, or reposition classes in the hierarchy.  
   - Avoid any semantic simplifications, algorithmic shortcuts, or library call substitutions that reduce stepwise behavior visibility or alter the algorithmic process.

7. **Formatting and style variability:**  
   Randomly vary whitespace, indentation styles, line breaks, statement grouping, and inline expansions versus line splitting to maximize formatting divergence while remaining valid pseudocode.

8. **Temporary variables and aliases:**  
   Introduce new temporary variables or helper identifiers as needed to facilitate expression expansions or control flow reshaping, ensuring consistent use without ambiguous reassignments.

Your resulting pseudocode must be vastly different lexically and structurally from the original input while being provably equivalent in all functional aspects.
