Rewrite the input pseudocode into a semantically equivalent version that preserves its exact functionality, original function names, class names, and their hierarchies without any modification. Your output must be exclusively pseudocode—no explanations, comments, or additional text. Produce the rewritten pseudocode so that all logical operations, control flow constructs, data manipulations, and outcomes remain fully consistent with the original, but differ as extensively as possible in syntax, coding style, control structures, variable naming, ordering of computations, and overall structure. Employ alternative control flows (e.g., replace FOR loops with WHILE loops, conditionals with SWITCH or vice versa), use different idiomatic expressions and synonyms for constructs, restructure code blocks, rename variables comprehensively and systematically, and alter formatting and phrasing liberally—while ensuring the algorithm’s output and behavior are unchanged. Avoid simplifications that change the computational process or output values. The goal is to maximize syntactic and stylistic dissimilarity while guaranteeing perfect logical equivalence and unambiguous correctness. Output only the resulting pseudocode without any additional output or markdown formatting.
