Given an input pseudocode snippet, rewrite it to produce an entirely fresh implementation that preserves **exactly all original semantics, outputs, side-effects, and data flow**, including **all original function names, class names, method signatures, and their hierarchical placements without any changes**, but is otherwise transformed to appear as if written independently from scratch.

Your rewritten pseudocode must satisfy these criteria:

- Preserve **all function and method names verbatim**, parameter names, their order, and nesting within classes exactly as given.

- Keep all **class names and their inheritance or containment structure identical**.

- Leave all existing **return statements**, I/O, and side effects intact and unchanged in order and meaning.

- Perform a comprehensive transformation to maximize **lexical, syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence** from the original pseudocode, including but not limited to:

  1. **Variable and Identifier Renaming:** Systematically rename all local variables, parameters, loop counters, temporaries, and intermediate identifiers to new, contextually plausible but distinct names with no overlap with original names.

  2. **Control Flow Restructuring:**
      - Replace all `for` loops with `while` loops, recursion, or functional-style constructs and vice versa.
      - Substitute if-else conditionals with logically equivalent guard clauses, early returns, inverted conditions (using De Morganâ€™s laws), switch/case statements, or merged conditionals.
      - Unroll small loops or convert loops into recursive functions where meaningful, otherwise regroup or reorder logically independent operations safely.
      - Flatten nested conditionals where logical, or nest conditionals differently without changing logic.

  3. **Expression Reformulation:** Rewrite each expression and condition to an equivalent form by:
      - Applying arithmetic identities, distributing or factoring expressions, changing operand order without changing evaluation.
      - Using alternative operators or logical equivalents (e.g., `!(A && B)` to `!A || !B`).
      - Replacing direct indexing with iterators or element-based access where feasible and vice versa.
      - Simplifying or expanding expressions in ways that preserve exact semantics.

  4. **Statement Splitting/Merging:** Arbitrarily split complex statements into multiple intermediate steps or merge successive simple statements into single expressions as long as final semantics are preserved.

  5. **Data Structure Traversal Variants:** Change traversal approaches for arrays, lists, or strings by switching between index-based loops, element-wise loops, iterator pattern, queue or stack traversal, or recursion, while maintaining ordering and exact processing.

  6. **Formatting and Style Overhaul:** Alter all indentation styles, line breaks, grouping of statements, whitespace, and reformat comments (if present) by relocating them or changing their format, to maximize superficial difference.

- Do **not** add, remove, or reorder functions, methods, or classes.

- Do **not** change parameter lists or class signatures.

- Do **not** alter the observable external behavior, input/output interface, return values, or side effects in any way.

The output must be **ONLY** the rewritten pseudocode snippet.

**Strict emphasis:** Maintain the original public API (names, parameters, hierarchy) exactly but otherwise strive for **maximal possible syntactic and lexical novelty** so the new pseudocode looks like an independently authored, distinct implementation that performs the identical task flawlessly. 

Your goal is to produce a rewritten pseudocode that shares **minimal lexical, structural, and syntactic overlap** with the original despite preserving its exact semantics and interface.

**Output format:** Only the rewritten pseudocode.
