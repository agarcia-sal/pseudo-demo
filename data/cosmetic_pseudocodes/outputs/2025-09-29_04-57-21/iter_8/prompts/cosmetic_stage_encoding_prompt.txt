Given an input pseudocode snippet, rewrite it to produce a version that faithfully preserves **all original functionality, data flow, and external behavior**, including returning identical outputs and maintaining all function names, class names, method signatures, and their hierarchical placement exactly as in the original pseudocode. Your rewritten pseudocode must appear as a completely fresh, non-trivially transformed implementation, achieving **maximal divergence** in all of the following dimensions without altering correctness:

- Systematically replace **all variable names, parameters, and temporary identifiers** with new semantically plausible but distinctly different names.

- Transform all control flow structures by replacing one construct with a semantically equivalent but structurally different alternative, for example:
  - Convert all `for` loops to `while` loops, recursion, or functional-style iteration constructs.
  - Substitute nested `if`-`else` blocks with early exits, guard clauses, switch/case equivalents, or inverted logic using De Morgan’s laws.
  - Unroll or regroup loops and conditionals where possible without changing logic.

- Reorder independent computations and combine or split statements, expressions, and intermediate calculations while preserving exact evaluation results.

- Rewrite every expression to a logically equivalent form using alternative arithmetic, Boolean identities, operand order swapping, negations, and equivalent operators.

- Alter data structure traversals, for instance:
  - Replace index-based iteration with iterators or element-based loops.
  - Use different navigation methods for collections (e.g., queues, stacks, recursion).

- Completely reformat the pseudocode’s appearance: change indentation styles, whitespace, line breaks, grouping of statements, and comment style or placement (if any comments exist).

- Avoid introducing any new functionality, changing API, or modifying the order and structure of classes, functions, and method signatures.

- Ensure no semantic changes occur to I/O behavior, return values, or side effects.

Your output must consist **solely** of the rewritten pseudocode snippet, with **no explanation, commentary, or annotations**.

**Strict constraints:**

- Retain **all original function names** verbatim.

- Keep **all original class names and their nesting (hierarchical structure)** identical.

- Preserve **method signatures exactly** (names, parameter names, order, and method placement).

- Maintain **all existing return statements and output structure** unchanged.

Aim for the generated pseudocode to look like an independently authored algorithm that performs the same task flawlessly but shares as little lexical, syntactic, and structural similarity with the original pseudocode as possible.
