Given a pseudocode snippet as input, generate a rewritten version that is functionally identical in every respect—preserving all outputs, side effects, return values, and I/O behavior exactly as in the original—while exhibiting the greatest possible syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence. Your transformation must strictly retain:

- All original **function names** verbatim.
- All original **class names**, preserving their exact hierarchical and nested placement.
- All **method and function signatures** exactly as given (parameter names, order, and locations).

Produce pseudocode only—no explanations or commentary.

To maximize difference yet preserve correctness, apply all of the following comprehensive transformations wherever applicable:

1. **Identifier Renaming:** Rename every variable, parameter, and temporary identifier to new, semantically coherent, and distinct names.

2. **Control Flow Restructuring:** Replace all control flow constructs with alternate semantically equivalent forms, including but not limited to:
   - Swap `for` loops for equivalent `while` loops, tail recursion, or iterator-based constructs.
   - Recast nested and chained conditionals to use guard clauses, early returns, inverted conditions with De Morgan’s laws, or `switch`/`case`-like structures.
   - Unroll loops partially or regroup iterations logically when safe.

3. **Expression Rewriting:** Reformulate all expressions using algebraic and Boolean identities, operator precedence changes, operand reordering, negations, and alternative equivalent operators or construct.

4. **Statement Reordering and Grouping:** Where statements or computations do not depend on each other’s order, reorder them freely or split/merge statements, preserving data dependencies and results.

5. **Data Structure Traversal Variation:** Convert index-based loops to iterator-based or element-based iteration, replace explicit indexing with recursion or indirect access, or alter the navigation techniques over collections (arrays, lists, queues, stacks).

6. **Format Overhaul:** Transform all formatting aspects—change indentation style, whitespace, line breaks, statement grouping, and comment positioning or syntax—while keeping comments’ semantic content intact.

7. **Code Style and Paradigm Shifts:** Optionally re-express iterative logic via recursion or vice versa, replace explicit accumulators with reductions or accumulative function calls, transform mechanism of building composite data, all without changing the algorithm’s observable behavior.

Do **not**:

- Introduce any new functions, methods, variables, or data structures.
- Modify or reorder class, function, or method definitions.
- Change any input/output protocols or the semantic meaning of I/O and return values.
- Add or remove comments beyond reformatting existing ones.

Your final output must be the rewritten pseudocode snippet alone, adhering strictly to the constraints above, resembling a fully independent, freshly authored, yet semantically identical implementation exhibiting maximal syntactic and structural divergence.
