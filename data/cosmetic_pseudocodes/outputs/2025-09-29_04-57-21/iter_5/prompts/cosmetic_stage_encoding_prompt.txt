Given a pseudocode snippet as input, generate a rewritten pseudocode version that is functionally identical in every aspect—retaining exact behavior, outputs, returned values, function names, class names, method signatures, and their nesting and structural hierarchy without any additions or omissions. Your rewritten pseudocode must maximize divergence from the original in **every possible syntactic, lexical, and structural dimension**, including but not limited to:

- Replace **all variable names, intermediate identifiers, loop counters, and parameters** with semantically distinct alternatives that differ completely from the original names.
- Convert all control flow constructs (e.g., `for`, `while`, `repeat-until`, recursion) into different logically equivalent forms, ensuring at least one level of structural transformation throughout (e.g., replacing loops by recursion, recursion by loops, flattening or deepening conditionals, replacing conditionals with guard clauses, or switch/case constructs).
- Reorder independent statements or combine/split complex expressions where semantics permit, rearrange calculations, and refactor the internal evaluation sequences without changing external logic or results.
- Rewrite expressions using logically and mathematically equivalent transformations (e.g., apply De Morgan’s laws, swap operands in commutative operations, replace direct comparisons with equivalent boolean expressions, or transform arithmetic identities).
- Thoroughly alter data structure traversal and element access methods (e.g., swap explicit index-based loops with iterator-style loops, pointer movement, or enhanced for-each mechanisms, or vice versa).
- Modify statement grouping and formatting extensively: change indentation style, line breaks, spacing, comment placement, or commenting style (add, remove, or rewrite comments if present), so the resulting pseudocode looks stylistically unrelated.
- Preserve all function and class signatures, nesting, and hierarchy **exactly as in the input**, without adding or removing parameters, changing visibility, or altering external interfaces.
- Retain the original returned values and output format precisely.
- You may restructure how data is accumulated or intermediate results are stored as long as the final outputs remain identical.
- Avoid using any recognizable syntactic template or pattern from the original pseudocode.
- Your output must be **only** the rewritten pseudocode—no explanations, metadata, or commentary of any kind.

Ensure the final output gives the maximum possible lexical, syntactic, and structural difference from the input pseudocode while perfectly preserving its semantics and external API.

**Strict Requirements:**  
- Do not alter function or method names  
- Do not change class names or their scope and nesting  
- Do not modify method signatures or parameter order  
- Do not change the expected external outputs or behavior

Your goal is to produce a rewritten pseudocode version so distinct that automated lexical similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU) are minimized, yet correctness and API remain 100% intact.

**Output only the transformed pseudocode snippet.**
