Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a rewritten version that **preserves every aspect of the original functionality, behavior, and output exactly**, including identical I/O, side effects, return values, and **strictly retains all original function names, class names, method signatures, and their hierarchical (class-nesting) structure unchanged**.

Your rewritten pseudocode should *maximally diverge* from the original in every other dimension, producing code that looks like an entirely independent implementation. Apply diverse, systematic transformations such as:

- Rename **all variables, parameters, and temporary identifiers** to new meaningful yet distinctly different names (no reuse).

- Transform control flow structures thoroughly by converting between semantically equivalent constructs:
  - Change `for` loops to `while` loops, recursion, or functional iteration.
  - Replace nested conditionals with guard clauses, early returns, inverted logic (using De Morgan’s laws), or switch/case alternatives.
  - Split, merge, unroll, or reorder loops and conditional branches, *without changing logic or order of side effects*.
  
- Re-express every expression and condition using alternative logically equivalent forms:
  - Use Boolean algebra rewrites, operator rearrangement, negations, and equivalent arithmetic identities.
  - Swap operand order when safe, rewrite comparisons with equivalent formulations, and rewrite constants and literals in alternate valid ways.

- Rework data structure traversals and accesses:
  - Replace index-based loops with iterator-based or element-based loops.
  - Change navigation methods (e.g., recursion instead of iteration, stacks/queues, or different iteration orders) while preserving exact functionality.

- Restructure computations by decomposing or combining statements and expressions; reorder independent statements wherever semantic order permits.

- Completely overhaul formatting, indentation style, code block grouping, line breaks, and comment style or placement if comments exist — produce fresh layout that looks handwritten and different.

- Avoid **any** changes to API, class/function signatures, method placements, or additional/dropped behavior.

Your output must consist **exclusively** of the rewritten pseudocode snippet, containing no explanation, commentary, metadata, or annotations whatsoever.

**Strict rules to follow:**

- Preserve **all function names exactly** as in the original.

- Preserve **all class names and their nesting structure** exactly as in the original.

- Preserve **all method signatures verbatim**, including parameter names, order, and placement inside classes.

- Preserve all return statements, outputs, and overall side-effect behavior identically.

**Goal:** The rewritten pseudocode should appear as a completely independent, differently authored, and substantially dissimilar algorithm that performs the *precisely* same task flawlessly, minimizing lexical, syntactical, and structural similarity with the input.

**Output only the new pseudocode**—do not provide any explanation or notes.
