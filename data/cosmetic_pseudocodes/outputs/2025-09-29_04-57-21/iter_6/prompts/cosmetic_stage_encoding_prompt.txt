Given an input pseudocode snippet, generate a new version of the pseudocode that **exactly preserves all original functionality, behavior, and external API**, including but not limited to:

- Keeping all **function names**, **class names**, and their **hierarchical placements** identical.
- Retaining all **method signatures** (names, parameters, order) and **nesting** unchanged.
- Producing code that, when executed, yields the **identical outputs** for the same inputs as the original.

At the same time, your rewritten pseudocode must be as **maximally syntactically, structurally, and lexically dissimilar** to the input as possible by applying extensive, principled transformations such as:

- Renaming **all variables, temporary identifiers, and parameters** to new, meaningful, yet unrelated names.
- Performing radical control flow rewrites: for example, convert loops to recursion or vice versa; replace nested conditions with flat guards, switch/case, pattern matching, or table-driven dispatch; interchange loop unrolling and grouping; transform iteration order or loop boundaries as long as semantics are preserved.
- Reordering, factoring, or merging/splitting computations and expressions, provided the result is logically equivalent.
- Re-expressing logical and arithmetic expressions using alternative but equivalent formulations, including De Morgan’s laws, distributive laws, changing operand order, replacing operators with equivalent expressions, and converting implicit conditions to explicit and vice versa.
- Changing data traversal techniques, e.g., swapping indexed loops for iterator-based loops or foreach-style, or explicit pointer/index manipulation as suitable.
- Altering formatting drastically: use different indentation styles, line breaks, statement grouping, or spacing to create distinct visual structure.
- Modifying statement order or nesting where semantic equivalence is maintained.
- Eliminating or adding comments only if they do not change code behavior; adapting comment style if present, or removing all comments to increase difference.
- Avoiding code duplication or introducing it only if the logic remains the same.
- Replacing built-in-like operations or aggregations by their expanded or reduced equivalents, e.g., replacing a single sum statement with explicit accumulation code, or vice versa.

**Strict constraints — absolutely do NOT alter:**

- Function/method names, parameter names, and their order.
- Class and interface names, their inheritance, or containment structure.
- Overall program structure, including nesting of functions inside classes or modules.
- Expected outputs, return values, or side effects.
- External API or method signatures.

**Your output must be ONLY the rewritten pseudocode without any explanations, comments, or annotations — no extra text.** The rewritten code should read as a completely independent reimplementation of the input, while fully honoring the original contract and correctness.
