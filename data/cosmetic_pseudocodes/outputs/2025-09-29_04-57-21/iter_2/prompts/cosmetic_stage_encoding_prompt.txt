Given the input pseudocode, produce a rewritten version that preserves **all original functionality exactly**, with **no additions, removals, or changes** to function names, class names, or their structure (including methods and nesting). Your goal is to **maximize the difference from the original pseudocode** by extensively transforming all other aspects, including:

- Variable and temporary identifier names (use completely different, meaningful names).
- Control flow constructs (e.g., convert between loops, recursion, conditionals, switch/case, guard clauses, etc.).
- Expression forms and operations (rewrite arithmetic and logical expressions using alternative but equivalent logic).
- Statement order and sequencing where semantics allow.
- Code formatting, indentation style, and whitespace.
- Data structure usage and iteration methods.
- Use of helper variables and intermediate computations (you may refactor and reorder computations inside functions).
  
**Do NOT** change the calling signatures, function/class names, or the overall class/object layout.

**Output only the transformed pseudocode, without any commentary, explanation, or extra text.**
