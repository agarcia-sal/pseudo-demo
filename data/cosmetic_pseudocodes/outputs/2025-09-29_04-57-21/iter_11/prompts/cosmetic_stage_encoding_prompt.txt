Given any input pseudocode, generate a fully rewritten version that preserves **exactly** the original program’s behavior, outputs, side effects, function names, class names, method signatures, and nested structure without any additions, removals, or reorderings of API-level constructs. Your goal is to maximize **syntactic, lexical, and structural divergence** from the input, resulting in pseudocode that looks like a completely independent implementation, while ensuring perfect functional equivalence. To achieve this:

- Rename every variable, parameter, and temporary identifier consistently to fresh, semantically plausible alternatives that share no substrings with original names.

- Replace all control flow constructs with semantically equivalent but different patterns, utilizing a wide variety of approaches such as:
  - Converting all `for` loops into `while` loops, recursion, map/filter/reduce style iterations, or generator-driven loops.
  - Transforming nested conditionals into flattened guard clauses, early returns, inverted Boolean logic using De Morgan’s laws, or switch/case-like structures.
  - Splitting compound statements into sequences or merging sequential statements into compound expressions, wherever semantics remain unchanged.
  - Expanding or collapsing loop bodies, and unrolling or rolling up loops carefully without modifying logic.

- Rewrite every expression and condition by applying equivalence transformations, including:
  - Rearranging operands leveraging associativity and commutativity.
  - Replacing operators with equivalent expressions (e.g., `x != y` → `!(x == y)`, `a + b` → `b + a`).
  - Substituting arithmetic or Boolean identities.
  - Using alternative forms of indexing or access (e.g., element iteration vs. index-based).

- Change how data structures are traversed or manipulated by:
  - Switching index-based iteration to element-based iteration (or vice versa).
  - Using queue/stack or recursion to emulate loops, and vice versa.
  - Modifying order of iteration for independent statements if it doesn’t affect outcomes.

- Completely revamp formatting and style details including indentation, line breaks, spacing, comment style and placement, and grouping of statements.

- Maintain verbatim:
  - Function and method names.
  - Class names and their nested placements and hierarchies exactly as in the original.
  - Method signatures, including parameter names and order.
  - Return statements and output formatting.

- Do **not** add or remove functionality, change the order or composition of classes, functions, or method declarations, or alter any external behaviors.

Your output must be **only** the rewritten pseudocode snippet — no explanations, comments, or annotations.

The rewritten pseudocode should read as a distinct, nontrivial, and independently conceived implementation with minimal lexical or structural overlap, while preserving flawless correctness under all inputs.
