Rewrite the given pseudocode to generate a functionally identical version that strictly adheres to these enhanced requirements:

1. **Semantics and functionality MUST be preserved exactly** — all behaviors, side-effects, input-output contracts, termination criteria, and correctness remain unchanged in every detail.

2. **Keep all original function names, class names, type declarations, class/object nesting, and inheritance structures untouched, preserving exact spelling, casing, and placement.**

3. **Output ONLY complete, valid pseudocode** that represents the entire input program or function(s). No explanations, annotations, comments, or extraneous text are allowed.

4. **Replace all other identifiers (local variables, parameters, constants, temporaries) with freshly generated, semantically neutral, unrelated names.** These must be consistent throughout their scopes and avoid any collisions or reuse from the original or within the new code.

5. Achieve maximal syntactic and structural divergence by applying *at least five* of the following transformations in combination, wherever applicable, and exhaustively:

   - Convert iterative loops into equivalent recursive (including tail-recursive) forms, and convert recursive patterns into iterative loops or iterative state machines, ensuring avoidance of unbounded stack usage.

   - Systematically transform conditional statements: replace if-else chains with switch/case or decision tables; rewrite boolean expressions using De Morgan laws, distributive/associative transformations, or logically equivalent alternatives; flatten or deepen nested conditionals as long as semantics are unchanged.

   - Arbitrarily reorder, split, merge, or regroup sequences of statements and blocks, without altering behavior or externally visible side-effects.

   - Reformulate expressions equivalently: reorder arithmetic operations, replace operations by identities, factor or expand expressions, substitute constants with equivalent forms, rewrite comparison sequences, or transform data-value constructions while preserving semantics.

   - Substitute data structures with alternative valid representations: arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets, recursive data structures into indexed forms, explicit stacks instead of recursion, etc., provided behavior matches exactly.

   - Vary formatting aggressively: indentation style (tabs/spaces, amount), line breaks (split or combine statements), spacing, and statement ordering that does not affect execution.

6. Preserve, without modification, any unreachable or redundant code **only if** its complete behavioral impact is preserved; if safe, remove only truly dead code that does not affect correctness or outputs.

7. **Do not add or remove any functionality or program elements beyond those present in the original pseudocode.** No introduction of new language features or paradigms should occur.

8. Avoid trivial renamings or superficial changes; the result must be *substantially different* in syntax and structure while maintaining perfect semantic equivalence.

Your output must be **exclusively** the rewritten pseudocode fulfilling all of the above.

**Summary:**  
From a given pseudocode input, output a maximally transformed, drastically restructured but semantically identical version, preserving all function/class names and overall structure, replacing only non-global identifiers with consistent fresh names, and applying extensive, combined transformations for a distinctly novel rendering without any explanatory text.
