Rewrite the given pseudocode into a completely distinct form that **preserves exactly the same external behavior, functionality, input-output relationships, side-effects, and termination guarantees**, with these mandatory stipulations:

- **Retain all function names, class names, and the entire class/object/nesting/inheritance hierarchy, including the spelling and casing of those identifiers exactly as in the original.**  
- Rename *all other identifiers* (variables, parameters, constants, temporary values) to unrelated, semantically neutral, consistently used substitutes—no overlap or reuse that could cause confusion or incorrect binding.  
- Remove or rewrite any unreachable or redundant code **only if** it does not alter the observable behavior or side effects.  
- The output must be valid, self-contained pseudocode reflecting a whole working implementation, without any accompanying explanation, commentary, or extraneous text—just the code.  

Focus on maximizing syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence from the original pseudocode by applying **multiple, combined and often orthogonal transformations**, including but not limited to:

- Converting iterative loops (for, while) into recursion (including tail recursion), comprehensions, fold/reduce patterns, filter/map pipelines, or any logically equivalent control flow, and vice versa.  
- Replacing conditional forms (if-else, if, switch/case) with logically equivalent alternatives (nested conditions, ternary expressions, De Morgan laws, boolean algebra rewrites, early returns/guards) that reorder or refactor control paths without changing meaning.  
- Transforming data representations among equivalent data structures (e.g., switching between lists, arrays, sets, queues, linked lists) wherever semantics allow, ensuring identical behavior.  
- Splitting, merging, reordering, or grouping statements and blocks freely, as long as semantics and side effects remain intact.  
- Applying equivalent arithmetic and logic substitutions (e.g., commutative rearrangement of operands, alternative arithmetic formulations, boolean logic equivalences, expression refactoring, constant folding).  
- Varying layout dramatically: change indentation styles, line breaks, grouping, order of logically independent statements, whitespace usage to maximize surface-level novelty.  
- For recursive functions vulnerable to deep recursion, rewrite into iterative or tail-recursive patterns to avoid overflow without changing logic.  
- Avoid introducing any novel language constructs, libraries, or abstractions not present or implied by the original pseudocode’s paradigm and idioms.  

**The final output must be only the rewritten pseudocode**, optimized for maximal dissimilarity to the input code, while guaranteeing perfect semantic preservation under every possible test scenario.
