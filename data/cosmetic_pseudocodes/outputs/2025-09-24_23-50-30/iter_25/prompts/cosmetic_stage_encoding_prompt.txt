Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a new, standalone version that retains **exactly the same functionality and observable behavior** including all side effects and termination conditions. In your output:

- Keep **all function and class names precisely unchanged**, as well as the exact class/object hierarchy, inheritance, and nesting structures.

- The output must be **only valid pseudocode**, with no additional explanation, commentary, or non-code content.

Transform the code to maximize structural, syntactic, and lexical novelty by applying comprehensive, semantics-preserving rewrites, including but not limited to:

1. **Control flow transformations**  
   - Convert loops to recursion or recursion to loops, using tail-recursion or iterative equivalents when suitable (especially if original recursion is deep).  
   - Replace conditionals with logically equivalent but structurally distinct formulations (e.g., nested vs flat conditions, guard clauses, switch/case statements, ternary forms, short-circuit logic).  
   - Re-express Boolean expressions using De Morgan’s laws, alternate logical equivalences, or rearrangement.

2. **Data structure and expression variations**  
   - Substitute data structures with semantically equivalent alternatives when possible (arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets; linked vs indexed structures).  
   - Rewrite equivalent arithmetic expressions (e.g., `x + 1` as `1 + x`; `a AND b` as `NOT(NOT a OR NOT b)`) and reorder operands or combine/split expressions preserving outcome.

3. **Identifier renaming**  
   - Rename all local variable and parameter identifiers to unrelated, semantically neutral names consistently throughout the code without conflicting with function/class identifiers or scopes.  
   - Do not alter any function or class names.

4. **Code restructuring and statement reordering**  
   - Reorder independent statements, merge/split multi-part statements, restructure expression groupings, and modify control flow blocks while preserving semantics.  
   - Remove any unreachable or dead code only if it does not change any functional aspects.

5. **Formatting and presentation**  
   - Modify indentation styles, line breaks, spacing, and grouping to differ substantially from the original.  
   - Use alternative but equivalent syntax or pseudocode idioms within the paradigm of the original.

6. **Restrictions**  
   - Do **not** introduce any new language-specific features, external libraries, or dependencies not implied by the given pseudocode.  
   - Do **not** change any function or class names or their hierarchy/nesting.  
   - The output must be executable pseudocode that truly implements equivalent logic and behavior.

Your goal is to produce a maximally distinct yet fully equivalent pseudocode rendition, optimizing for diversity in code structure, syntax, variable naming, and control/data flow, all while ensuring flawless semantic preservation.

**Output only the rewritten pseudocode — no explanation or commentary.**
