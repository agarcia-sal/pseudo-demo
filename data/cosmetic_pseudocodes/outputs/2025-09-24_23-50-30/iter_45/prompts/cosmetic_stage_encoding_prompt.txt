Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a **functionally identical** and **semantically equivalent** variant that drastically diverges in wording, structure, and style, while rigorously preserving all original behaviors, correctness, side effects, inputs, outputs, and termination conditions. Your output must contain **only** the transformed pseudocode, with **no explanations, comments, or any text outside the pseudocode itself**.

To maximize orthogonality from the source, apply a rich combination of the following transformations wherever valid and consistent:

- **Identifier Renaming:** Retain the exact original function and class names and all class/object nesting and inheritance structures with original spelling and casing unchanged.  
  Rename **all other identifiers** (local variables, parameters, constants, temporaries) consistently to fresh, semantically neutral, unambiguous names that never shadow or collide in their scopes.

- **Control Flow Reworking:** Replace loops with equivalent recursion or tail recursion (and vice versa); use alternate loop types or iterator/comprehension abstractions if compatible; unroll, merge, or split loops and conditionals arbitrarily but safely.

- **Conditionals and Boolean Logic:** Fascinatingly restructure all conditional logic using equivalent boolean algebra transformations including De Morgan’s laws, distribution, factoring, ternary expressions, switch-cases, nested guards, or rewritten predicate expressions.

- **Data Structure Alternatives:** Swap between equivalent representations of data (lists ↔ arrays, linked lists ↔ indexed forms, sets ↔ dictionaries) as long as behavior and performance characteristics relevant to correctness remain intact.

- **Statement and Block Refactoring:** Arbitrarily reorder, split, merge, or regroup independent code blocks or statements; extract subexpressions or inline computations where safe; reorder variable declarations respecting dependencies.

- **Expression Equivalence:** Rewrite arithmetic, logical, and string expressions into equivalent but syntactically distinct forms such as reordered operations, factored forms, different constant folding, alternate arithmetic formulations, or equivalent function calls.

- **Formatting and Syntax Styling:** Vary indentation, line breaks, spacing, alignment, and statement delimiters extensively to maximize visible divergence while preserving valid pseudocode syntax.

- **Recursion and Iteration:** Convert deep recursion to iteration or tail recursion to avoid stack overflows if the original code risks it, ensuring identical functionality and termination behavior.

- **Dead Code Pruning:** Remove only genuinely unreachable or redundant code portions that do not affect any observable program behavior or output.

- **No Additions or Removals:** Do not add features or remove any functional aspect beyond dead code elimination; avoid introducing language features, paradigms, or constructs not present in the original pseudocode.

The transformation must produce **complete, valid pseudocode for the original program**, strictly preserving exactly all external and internal semantics, including the precise input-output contract, side effects, and correctness guarantees.

Your response must **contain only the transformed pseudocode** adhering to these constraints, to maximize novelty and orthogonality while guaranteeing 100% behavioral equivalence.

**Summary:**  
- Keep **function and class names, class/object structures, and inheritance hierarchies exactly as-is**.  
- Rename **all other variables entirely—consistent and collision-free**.  
- Perform **deep, multi-level structural rewrites** across control flow, expressions, data representation, and logic.  
- Keep code **valid, complete, and with identical semantics**.  
- Output **only the new pseudocode, no explanations or extra text**.
