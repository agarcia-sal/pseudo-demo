Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally identical but maximally divergent version according to the following strict guidelines:

1. **Preserve all original function and class names exactly**, maintaining the full original class hierarchy, inheritance, and structural organization without any modifications to names or nesting.

2. The output must be solely **valid, standalone pseudocode**, free from any explanations, comments, or meta-text. Deliver only the transformed code.

3. Achieve maximal difference from the original pseudocode across all other dimensions, including but not limited to:

   - Change control flow constructs extensively: transform loops to recursion and recursion to loops where safe and semantically equivalent; use alternative conditional structures such as guard clauses, early exits, nested ternary-like expressions, or switch/case equivalents if supported.
   
   - Rename all variables and parameters **except** for functions/classes, replacing them with neutral, unrelated names to avoid semantic overlap.

   - Employ algebraic and logical equivalencies in expressions (e.g., replace `x > y` with `not (x <= y)`), distribute or factor computations differently, introduce arithmetic rearrangements that maintain exact values.

   - Reorder independent statements and expressions freely wherever it does not affect program correctness.

   - Substitute data structures with equally functional alternatives—e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets, explicit iterations ↔ comprehensions or pipelines (map/filter/reduce), or flatten nested loops into higher-order function chains.

   - Split compound statements into smaller steps or merge simple consecutive statements logically to create different structural patterns.

   - Vary formatting, indentation style, capitalization, and line-breaking substantially from the original.

4. **Guarantee perfect preservation of the original I/O behavior and side effects.** Your rewritten pseudocode must produce identical results for all input cases.

5. **Avoid introducing any language-specific features, external dependencies, or constructs foreign to the original pseudocode’s paradigm.**

6. For recursive solutions, ensure termination conditions are intact and do not cause excessive or infinite recursion. Prefer iterative form if original recursion could exceed normal stack limits.

7. Remove any dead code or redundant operations only if it does not change any observable behavior or outputs.

8. In multi-function/class code inputs, maintain all original structural elements and replace all internal variable/parameter names as specified; do not alter function/class signatures.

Output only the transformed pseudocode, maximizing structural and syntactical novelty while guaranteeing flawless functional equivalence.
