Rewrite the given pseudocode into a **functionally identical** version that strictly meets all the following requirements:

1. **Preserve every exact behavior and guarantee:**
   - Maintain identical side-effects, input/output relationships, termination behavior, error handling, and overall correctness.
   - Do **not** change function names, class names, or entire class/object hierarchies, including their nesting and inheritance structures. These must remain precisely as in the original pseudocode (case-sensitive and spelling-sensitive).

2. **Transform all other identifiers:**
   - Replace every other identifier (local variables, parameters, constants, temporaries) with freshly invented, **semantically neutral, and non-colliding** names compared to the original and within their scope.
   - Ensure consistent renaming of each identifier across their entire scope.

3. **Maximize structural and syntactic divergence by applying a rich combination of diverse, semantics-preserving rewrites, including but not limited to:**
   - Converting loops (for, while, do-while) into recursion (including tail-recursive forms) or using comprehensions, iterators, or equivalent constructs when supported (and vice versa).
   - Thoroughly restructuring conditional expressions using logically equivalent transformations: if-else ↔ switch/case/guard/ternary, Boolean algebra simplifications and De Morgan’s laws, splitting/merging guards, reorganizing nested conditions and early returns.
   - Reordering statements and blocks arbitrarily where it does not affect side-effects or semantics; splitting or merging sequential statements.
   - Re-expressing all arithmetic and logical expressions into logically equivalent but syntactically distinct forms: reorder operations, refactor constants, distribute or factor expressions, invert boolean logic with negations, apply associativity and commutativity.
   - Substituting data structure representations with semantically equivalent alternatives when allowed in the pseudocode domain (e.g., arrays vs lists, sets vs maps with boolean keys); preserve original semantics exactly.
   - Varying formatting aggressively and unpredictably: indentation style and depth, line breaks, spacing, statement ordering (while preserving correctness).
   - Eliminating unreachable or redundant code only if it can be proven that their removal preserves **exactly the same external behavior** under all conditions.
   - Where recursion depth may be problematic, prefer equivalent iterative or tail-recursive transformations that preserve semantics and avoid stack overflow.

4. **Prohibited changes:**
   - Do not introduce new language paradigms, constructs, or features beyond those already present in the original pseudocode.
   - Do not add explanatory comments, annotations, or any text other than the complete transformed pseudocode.
   - Do not remove or add any functionality or observable effects.

5. **Output requirements:**
   - Output must contain **only the fully transformed, syntactically valid, and self-contained pseudocode** for the exact same program.
   - The output must be a drop-in semantic equivalent that meets all above constraints with maximal orthogonality and novelty versus the original.

This transformation aims to generate a maximally different, orthogonal pseudocode variant that preserves the exact original semantics, ensuring unchanged function and class identifiers and structural hierarchies, while radically restructuring all other elements for syntactic diversity and improved robustness against common pitfalls like recursion limits.
