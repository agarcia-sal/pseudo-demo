Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally identical version that differs maximally from the original in all non-essential aspects, including its control flow, syntax, variable naming, logic sequencing, and formatting.  
- Preserve the original function names exactly, as well as all class names, preserving the original class and object hierarchy and structure.  
- Feel free to replace loops with recursion or comprehensions, convert conditionals into equivalent logical expressions, reorder non-dependent statements, and employ alternative data constructs or control structures.  
- Maintain identical input/output behavior and produce results fully matching the original pseudocode semantics.  
- Avoid any commentary, explanation, or annotation in your output; provide only the transformed pseudocode.  
- Ensure your output is syntactically valid pseudocode and self-contained.
