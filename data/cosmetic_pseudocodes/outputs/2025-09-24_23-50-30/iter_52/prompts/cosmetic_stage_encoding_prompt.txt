Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally equivalent version that strictly adheres to the following comprehensive criteria:

1. **Semantic Integrity:**
   - Preserve **all original behaviors, side effects, input-output contracts, termination conditions, algorithmic logic, and correctness** without exception.
   - Do **not** modify any functional outcomes, edge cases, or implicit assumptions.

2. **Naming and Structural Constraints:**
   - Retain **exactly all original function names, class names, method names, and their nesting, including class and object hierarchies and inheritance structures, with precise spelling and casing**.
   - Replace **every other identifier** (local variables, parameters, constants, temporaries) with completely new, semantically neutral, non-colliding names that are **internally consistent** within their scope.

3. **Output Format:**
   - Produce **only valid, standalone, fully syntactically correct pseudocode for the same program**.
   - Omit all comments, explanations, metadata, or any non-code text.
   
4. **Maximize Syntactic and Structural Divergence:**
   Transform the pseudocode by applying a rich and combined set of diverse rewrites, strictly **without altering semantics**, including but not limited to:

   - **Control Flow Transformations:**
     - Convert loops (for, while) to equivalent recursion or tail recursion, iterator-based processing, comprehensions, or other control flow structures, and vice versa.
     - Re-express conditionals by replacing if-else chains with switch/case statements, guard clauses, nested conditionals, ternaries, or equivalent boolean algebra rewrites utilizing De Morgan’s laws and logical simplifications.
     
   - **Expression Rewriting:**
     - Rewrite arithmetic and boolean expressions using associative, commutative, distributive laws, factoring, expansion, reordering operands, constant folding variations, and equivalent negations.
     
   - **Data Structure Variants:**
     - Swap data structures with equivalent alternatives where semantics permit (e.g., arrays ↔ lists, sets ↔ unordered collections), preserving all access patterns and behaviors.
     
   - **Block Restructuring:**
     - Arbitrarily reorder, split, merge, inline, or abstract sequences of statements, blocks, or expressions as long as behavior remains identical.
     
   - **Formatting and Stylistic Variation:**
     - Vary indentation, spacing, line breaks, statement ordering, and naming patterns freely to maximize superficial syntactic novelty.
     
   - **Recursion and Iteration Balance:**
     - Convert deep recursion into equivalent iterative or tail-recursive forms to avoid stack overflow risks, or vice versa, while strictly preserving termination behavior.
   
5. **Code Hygiene:**
   - Remove only unreachable or semantically inert redundant code **if and only if** full external behavior is preserved unaltered.
   - Do **not** add any functionality, external calls, or constructs beyond those already present.
   
Your output must be exclusively this rewritten pseudocode, delivering **maximally orthogonal, novel, and well-formed** code that precisely mirrors the original’s semantics, identifiers constraints, and structural patterns.
