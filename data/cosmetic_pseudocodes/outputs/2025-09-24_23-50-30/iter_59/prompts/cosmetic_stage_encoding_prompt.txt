Rewrite the input pseudocode to generate a functionally equivalent version that strictly adheres to the following enhanced requirements:

1. **Preserve precisely all original semantics, behaviors, side effects, input-output contracts, state mutations, and termination guarantees** exactly as in the original pseudocode.

2. Maintain **all original function and class names unchanged** (including exact spelling and casing) and preserve **all original class, module, and object nesting and inheritance hierarchies exactly** as-is, without any renaming or restructuring.

3. The output must contain **only valid, executable pseudocode** corresponding to the original program’s fragments—no explanations, comments, annotations, meta-text, or extraneous formatting instructions; output strictly code only.

4. Rename **all locally scoped identifiers** (such as local variables, function parameters, temporary variables, constants, helper variables, loop indices, accumulators) systematically to freshly invented, non-meaningful, semantically neutral names, ensuring **no collisions within their scopes** and name uniqueness throughout. Use a consistent renaming scheme that keeps identical variables consistently renamed throughout the code.

5. Apply **maximal comprehensive structural, syntactic, and semantic preserving transformations combined**, including but not limited to:

   - Systematically rewrite iterative constructs into equivalent recursive, tail-recursive, or functional-style (map/filter/reduce, comprehensions, folds) forms, and recursively transform recursive functions into iterative or tail-recursive variants that avoid risk of stack overflow, where possible.

   - Extensively reorganize and rewrite conditional logic: replace if-else chains with switch/case statements or pattern-matching equivalents; convert conditions into logically equivalent but syntactically distinct forms using De Morgan's laws, boolean algebra, algebraic factoring, negations, and normalized forms.

   - Substitute equivalent data structures (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets ↔ queues), preserving all access patterns and behaviors exactly.

   - Arbitrarily reorder, group, split, merge, or nest blocks/statements/expressions where semantics are unchanged, including introducing local helper functions or inline expansions, while preserving all functional effects and order of observable side-effects.

   - Rewrite arithmetic and Boolean expressions into logically equivalent variants: alter operator order/precedence, factor or expand expressions, replace operators with alternative equivalents (e.g., addition with subtraction from constants), and apply constant folding or partial evaluation as long as external behavior is identical.

   - Systematically vary formatting and layout (indentation depth and style, horizontal vs vertical breaks, whitespace and line breaks, statement concatenation) to maximize surface-level divergence while keeping syntactic validity.

   - Introduce balanced use of alternative control flow constructs available in pseudocode (e.g., repeat-until, do-while, labeled jumps, guards) as equivalents where possible.

   - Remove unreachable or truly redundant code only if it can be conclusively guaranteed that **no external behavior or output changes.**

6. Prohibit addition of new language features, paradigms, or extensions beyond those already used in the original pseudocode.

7. The output pseudocode should remain readily parsable and immediately translatable back to working code equivalent to the input.

8. Your completed output should contain **only the transformed pseudocode**, meeting all above requirements, and demonstrating maximal orthogonality and novelty relative to the input, while rigorously preserving exact original semantics, naming constraints, and termination.

---

**Summary:**

- Input: Any valid pseudocode fragment.

- Output: Semantically identical pseudocode differing *maximally* on variable names (ignoring functions/classes), syntax, control flow style, expression structure, data structures, statement ordering, and formatting, yet preserving exact functional behaviors and program structure.

- Output contains **only the code**, nothing else.

Use your full algorithmic and linguistic flexibility to produce the most syntactically and structurally distinct, behaviorally perfect pseudocode variant possible under these constraints.
