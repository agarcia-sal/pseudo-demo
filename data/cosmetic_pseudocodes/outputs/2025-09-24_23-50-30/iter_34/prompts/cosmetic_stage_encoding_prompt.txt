Rewrite the provided pseudocode to produce a version that is **functionally identical in every aspect**—including all behaviors, side-effects, input/output semantics, termination conditions, and result correctness—while strictly **preserving all original function and class names, as well as their exact nesting, hierarchical, and inheritance structures with unchanged spelling and casing**.

**Requirements and constraints**:

- Output only valid, self-contained pseudocode. Do **NOT** include any explanations, commentary, annotations, or supplementary text.

- Keep all function and class identifiers (names) and their positions within the structural hierarchy unchanged exactly as given.

- Rename **all other identifiers** (local variables, parameters, constants, temporary names, loop counters, accumulators, data structure element names, etc.) to arbitrary semantically neutral alternatives that bear no recognizably meaningful relation to the original names. Use consistent renaming within each identifier’s scope, **avoiding any collisions or shadowing**.

- Thoroughly maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic novelty by combining multiple transformations, for example (but not limited to):

  - Transform iterative constructs (for, while) into recursive or tail-recursive functions or vice versa.

  - Replace if-else chains with switch/case, nested conditions, ternary expressions, guards, or logically equivalent but structurally different boolean expressions using e.g. De Morgan’s laws.

  - Change the arrangement and grouping of statements by harmless splitting, merging, reordering within blocks, or sequence-preserving refactoring.

  - Substitute data structures with semantic equivalents (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets ↔ maps), converting linear to indexed or linked structures or vice versa, ensuring behavioral equivalence.

  - Re-express arithmetic and logical operations with equivalent forms, such as commutations, distributed forms, inverse operations, and different constant foldings.

  - Avoid deep recursion on large inputs by converting recursive routines to iterative or tail-recursive forms where suitable.

  - Modify formatting extensively: vary indentation levels, line breaks, whitespace placement, statement ordering, grouping, and line splitting to maximize surface-level differences.

- Remove unreachable or redundant code only if its removal leaves all externally observable behaviors unchanged.

- Do not introduce any new constructs or language-specific features beyond those implied by the original pseudocode paradigm.

- The rewritten pseudocode must be a fully working, standalone replacement implementing the same logic with identical input-output behavior.

Produce **only** the rewritten pseudocode adhering to these directives, optimizing for **maximum orthogonality and novelty from the original pseudocode’s presentation, while perfectly preserving semantic correctness and termination guarantees**.
