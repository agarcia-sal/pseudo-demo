Rewrite the given pseudocode so that it implements **identical behavior, exact input-output effects, side-effects, and halting conditions**, preserving **all original function names, class names, and their exact positions in the class/object/inheritance hierarchy** (including exact spelling and casing).

**Strict requirements**:

- Output only **complete, valid, self-contained pseudocode**; do **not** output any explanations, comments, or additional text.

- Keep all function and class identifiers exactly as in the original code, including their spellings and nesting structures.

- Rename **all other identifiers** (variables, parameters, constants, temporary names, loop counters, etc.) to **unrelated, semantically neutral, consistently scoped alternatives**, avoiding any naming collisions.

- Maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic novelty with **comprehensive, combined transformations**, including but not limited to:

  - Converting all iterative loops (for, while, repeat-until) to equivalent recursive, tail-recursive, or higher-order constructs (e.g., map/filter/reduce patterns) and vice versa, choosing transformations aggressively to increase difference.

  - Reorganizing and restructuring conditionals by replacing if-else chains with switch/case, multiple guarded clauses, nested expressions, ternary/logical operator cascades, and logically equivalent boolean rewrites using laws like De Morgan’s.

  - Re-expressing data structures using isomorphic alternatives wherever semantics allow (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets; linked nodes ↔ indexed elements), carefully preserving behavior.

  - Splitting, merging, or reordering statement and block groups when semantics and control flow remain fully intact.

  - Substituting equivalent arithmetic/logical expressions with alternatives (e.g., commutativity, associativity, distributivity, logical equivalences, different constant foldings).

  - Uniformly and aggressively varying formatting: indentation, line breaks, statement ordering, grouping, spacing, and expression layout, to maximize surface-level differences.

  - For recursive algorithms, systematically convert to iterative or tail-recursive forms to prevent potential stack overflows, without changing semantics.

- Remove unreachable or redundant code only if it does not affect any externally observable effect.

- Do not introduce any language-specific syntax or constructs beyond what is implied by the original pseudocode style and paradigms.

Your output must be a fully alternate but **semantically equivalent** restatement of the input pseudocode, with the **highest achievable difference** from the original while strictly preserving **all semantic correctness, behaviors, and naming conventions** for functions and classes.

Produce **only** the rewritten pseudocode meeting **all above criteria**—nothing else.
