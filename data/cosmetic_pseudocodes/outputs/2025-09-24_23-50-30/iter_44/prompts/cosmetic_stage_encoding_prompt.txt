Rewrite the input pseudocode to produce a maximally different but strictly functionally equivalent version, adhering precisely to these rules:

1. **Output only valid, complete pseudocode** that implements the exact same external behavior, side effects, termination conditions, input-output contracts, and correctness as the original. No explanations, comments, or any text other than the pseudocode itself.

2. **Preserve all function names, class names, inheritance hierarchies, and nesting structures (including exact spelling and casing) exactly as in the original pseudocode.** The transformed pseudocode must use the same APIs and structural layout at every level.

3. **Replace every other identifier** (local variables, parameters, constants, temporaries) with fresh, invented, semantically neutral names, consistently renamed throughout and guaranteed not to collide anywhere in scope.

4. **Apply aggressive, combined, and diverse transformational techniques to maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic difference** from the original pseudocode, including (but not limited to):

   - Converting loops to recursion (tail-recursive or otherwise), iterator chains, comprehensions, or alternative looping constructs, and vice versa.

   - Re-expressing all conditional logic using alternative equivalent forms such as nested if-else, switch/case, guard clauses, logical negations, De Morgan’s laws, Boolean algebra rewrites, or equivalent boolean expressions.

   - Changing data structure implementations to semantically equivalent alternatives (e.g., arrays vs lists, maps vs dictionaries, linked vs indexed representations) without altering behavior.

   - Arbitrarily reordering, splitting, merging, or grouping statements and blocks whenever semantics allow.

   - Rewriting arithmetic and logical expressions into equivalent but syntactically distinct formulas (e.g., altering operator associativity or factoring).

   - Varying formatting extensively: indentation, line breaks, spacing, statement order, whitespace, and control flow layout.

   - Transforming recursion with risk of deep call stacks into iterative or tail-recursive versions that eliminate stack overflow risk, without modifying semantics.

   - Replacing constant expressions via equivalent expansions or foldings, but never changing evaluated results.

5. **Do not add or remove any functional behavior or output; do not introduce any new language constructs beyond those in the original pseudocode.**

6. **Remove only truly unreachable or semantically redundant code if and only if this guarantees perfect preservation of all external observable behaviors.**

Your transformed pseudocode must be a rigorously verified semantic isomorph of the input, exhibiting maximal orthogonality and surface-level novelty, while strictly retaining original functionality, interfaces, class and function names, and structural composition.

Return only the rewritten pseudocode text—no explanation or annotations.
