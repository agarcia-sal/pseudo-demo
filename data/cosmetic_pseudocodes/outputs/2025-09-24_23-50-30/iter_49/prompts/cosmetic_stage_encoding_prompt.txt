Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a fully functionally equivalent version that meets **all** these detailed requirements:

1. **Functionality and Semantics Preservation**:  
   - Keep every behavior, side-effect, input-output contract, and termination condition exactly the same.  
   - Do not add, remove, or alter any logic, functionality, or language/paradigm features beyond what is in the original pseudocode.  
   - You may remove only unreachable or provably redundant code **if and only if** that does not affect any externally observable behavior.

2. **Preserve Naming and Structure of Global Elements**:  
   - Keep all **function names**, **class names**, and **class/object nesting and inheritance hierarchy** unchanged in spelling and capitalization, and in the exact same structural positions.  
   - The **same number** of functions and classes must be retained, with no additions or deletions.

3. **Rename Local Identifiers Completely and Consistently**:  
   - Replace **all local variables, parameters, constants, and temporary names** with **entirely new, unrelated, semantically neutral names**.  
   - Do not reuse any original local names or create conflicts within their scope.  
   - Keep these renamed identifiers consistent and coherent within their scope.

4. **Structural and Syntactic Maximization of Novelty**:  
   Apply many combined, aggressive transformations to rewrite the pseudocode so it deviates maximally from the original syntax and structure, including (but not limited to):

   - Transform iterative loops to tail-recursive or fully recursive procedures; transform recursive constructs back into iterative loops or equivalent tail-recursion where it improves clarity or avoids stack overflow.  
   - Rewrite conditionals extensively: convert between if-else chains, switch/case statements, nested guards, ternary expressions, and Boolean logic rewrites (De Morgan’s laws, equivalence transformations, logical factorization).  
   - Rearrange code blocks by splitting, merging, or reordering statements wherever semantic behavior is untouched.  
   - Replace data structures (e.g., lists ↔ arrays, sets ↔ hashes) with equivalent alternatives where semantics allow, faithfully preserving ordering and behavior.  
   - Rewrite expressions into logically equivalent but syntactically different forms (rearranged arithmetic, boolean negations, constant folding changes, factoring distributivity).  
   - Vary formatting widely: indentation style, line breaks, spacing, nesting style, and control flow constructs should differ markedly.  
   - Inline or extract helper functions, convert inline code into local functions or vice versa as appropriate while retaining identical functional behavior.  
   - Use descriptive but semantically neutral invented names for all renamed identifiers.  
   - Avoid direct translation styles—prefer non-trivial, idiomatic but equivalent ways of expressing the logic.

5. **Code Output Only**:  
   - Provide only valid, complete pseudocode implementing the described transformations.  
   - Do not include any explanations, comments, notes, or extra text.

The goal is to generate pseudocode that is **maximally orthogonal and novel in style and structure** compared to the input pseudocode but guarantees **perfect semantic equivalence and identical externally observable behavior**, with all original global names and structures preserved exactly.

---

**Output format reminder**:  
- Only the rewritten pseudocode.  
- Same function and class names, same nesting and inheritance.  
- All local identifiers renamed uniquely and consistently.  
- Highly transformed control flow and expressions.  
- No added or removed functionality or explanations.
