Rewrite the given pseudocode into a functionally identical but maximally orthogonal variant adhering strictly to these directives:

- Produce valid, complete pseudocode only—omit any explanations, comments, metadata, or extra text.

- Retain **all original function names, class names, and the entire class/object nesting and inheritance structure exactly as in the input**, preserving spelling, casing, and hierarchy without alteration.

- Preserve **all original behaviors rigorously**: input-output behavior, side-effects, termination conditions, correctness, and external observable semantics must remain fully intact.

- Rename every identifier except those explicitly required to stay (i.e., rename all local variables, parameters, constants, temporaries, and internal helper names). Generate freshly invented, semantically neutral identifiers that do not collide within their scope and maintain consistent renaming throughout the updated pseudocode.

- Apply aggressive, combined, and varied code transformations to maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence, including but not limited to these categories (choose and combine transformations flexibly):

  * Control Flow: Convert loops (for, while) into recursion, tail recursion, iterator-based constructs, comprehensions, or other equivalent forms, or revert recursive constructs into iterative forms.

  * Conditionals: Rewrite if-else chains as switch/case, logical guards, or nested ternaries; reorder or regroup conditions using De Morgan's laws and boolean algebra equivalences; expand or contract compound conditions logically.

  * Data Structures: Swap equivalent underlying representations (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets or linked ↔ indexed structures) wherever behavior permits.

  * Block Structure: Arbitrarily reorder, merge, or split statements and blocks where it does not affect program correctness or semantics.

  * Expressions: Rewrite arithmetic and boolean expressions into logically equivalent but syntactically distinct forms (change operand order, factorization, transform constants, apply equivalent operators).

  * Naming and Usage: Replace all literal constants where safe by semantically equivalent computations or symbolic expressions; reorder parameters in calls and declarations only if semantics allow; inline or extract expressions and sub-statements as appropriate.

  * Formatting: Apply extensive formatting variation with whitespace, line breaks, indentation styles, and statement grouping to maximize surface difference.

- Detect and remove unreachable or semantically redundant code only if doing so does not alter any externally observable behavior or side effects.

- Do **not** add or remove any functionality, data structures, language constructs, or paradigm features beyond those present in the original pseudocode.

Output only the transformed pseudocode, meeting all above constraints, maximizing novelty yet perfectly preserving all semantics and behaviors of the original.
