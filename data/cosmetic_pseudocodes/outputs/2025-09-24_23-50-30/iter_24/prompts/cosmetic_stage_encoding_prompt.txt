Rewrite the given pseudocode into a fully self-contained, valid pseudocode version that implements exactly the same functionality, preserving all function and class names **verbatim**, including their precise casing and hierarchical scope (class/object nesting and inheritance), but otherwise differs maximally in all other aspects.

Strict requirements:

1. **Do NOT rename or alter any function or class identifiers**; the original names, casing, and nesting must be strictly maintained to ensure exact external interfaces and structure.

2. **Change all variable and parameter names to completely unrelated, semantically neutral identifiers**, consistently throughout the transformed code, avoiding any name collisions or reuse of original variable names.

3. Transform control flow and structure as extensively as possible, applying any combination of the following (and more) where semantics allow:

   - Convert iterative loops into equivalent recursive functions or replace recursion with iterative constructs (including tail recursion), choosing the approach that best fits while avoiding possible stack overflow.

   - Substitute conditional constructs (if/else, switch/case) with logically equivalent alternatives, such as nested conditions, guard clauses, ternaries, inverted logic, or flattened case structures.

   - Replace data structures with alternative but semantically compatible types (arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets, linked structures ↔ indexed structures), modifying data access and manipulation accordingly.

   - Rearrange independent code statements or merge/split code blocks while preserving operation order where necessary for semantics.

   - Express logical and arithmetic expressions differently but equivalently (e.g., `a + b` as `b + a`, de Morgan’s laws for boolean expressions, alternative numeric expressions).

4. Alter formatting radically: spacing, indentation, line breaks, grouping of statements, statement layout, and ordering where semantics permit, to maximize syntactic novelty.

5. Remove any unreachable or redundant code if doing so does not change observable behavior or side effects.

6. **Do not introduce any constructs, idioms, or libraries outside the style and paradigm implied by the original pseudocode.** Maintain the same abstraction level, avoiding language-specific or advanced features not present or implied by the input.

7. Preserve **all input-output behavior, side effects, state changes, and termination properties exactly**, without exception.

8. The output must contain **only the transformed pseudocode** — no explanations, comments, or additional text.

This transformation aims to maximize syntactic and structural divergence while ensuring **perfect functional equivalence** and strict preservation of function/class names and hierarchies.

Produce the transformed pseudocode according to these instructions.
