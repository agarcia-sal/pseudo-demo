Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a new, functionally equivalent version that strictly meets these conditions:

1. **Preserve every original behavior exactly:** all side effects, input-output contracts, termination guarantees, and correctness must be identical—no loss, change, or addition of functionality is permitted.

2. **Keep all function names, class names, and the complete nesting and inheritance structures exactly as in the original code (including exact spelling and capitalization).** Do not rename or restructure them in any way.

3. **Output only valid, fully self-contained pseudocode** implementing the same program. No explanations, comments, metadata, or any extra text—only the transformed pseudocode itself.

4. **Rename every other identifier (local variables, parameters, constants, temporaries) to freshly generated, semantically neutral names that are unrelated to the originals, do not collide within scope, and are used consistently throughout the pseudocode.**

5. **Maximally transform the pseudocode to increase syntactic, structural, and stylistic divergence from the original code by applying a rich combination of diverse transformations such as:**

   - Converting all iterative constructs into semantically equivalent recursive, tail-recursive, or iterator-based patterns; alternately, convert recursive calls into iterative loops or other equivalent control flows, selecting whichever form increases novelty and avoids stack overflow where applicable.

   - Rewriting conditional constructs extensively: transform if-else to switch/case, nested guards, ternary operations, or other logically equivalent forms; apply Boolean algebra simplifications, De Morgan’s laws, distribution, factoring, negations, or rearrangements of complex boolean expressions.

   - Reorganizing and regrouping statements arbitrarily under semantic preservation: splitting, merging, reordering independent statements, or restructuring blocks so long as behavioral semantics are unchanged.

   - Substituting data structures with equivalents wherever possible without changing behavior: e.g., lists ↔ arrays ↔ sets; linked forms ↔ indexed forms; using different but semantically identical representations.

   - Altering arithmetic and logical expressions to equivalent but syntactically distinct forms: rearranged operands, factored or expanded forms, alternate constant folding, negations, or identity-based rewrites.

   - Varying formatting aggressively: changing indentation, line breaks, whitespace, placing statements differently on lines to maximize surface-level difference.

6. **Ensure the transformed pseudocode avoids deep recursion or other constructs that risk runtime exceptions (e.g., stack overflow), by using iterative or tail-recursive alternatives where necessary.**

7. **Remove only code that is provably unreachable or redundant without changing any externally observable behavior or semantics.**

8. **Do not add any new paradigms, language features, or constructs beyond those present in the original pseudocode.**

Your output must contain **only** the fully transformed pseudocode that satisfies all these constraints, achieving maximal diversity from the original while guaranteeing perfect semantic equivalence and correctness.

Remember:  
- Function names and class hierarchies remain exactly the same.  
- Only local/internal names are renamed.  
- No explanations, commentary, or anything beyond the transformed pseudocode itself.
