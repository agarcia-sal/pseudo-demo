Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally identical pseudocode version that is maximally syntactically and structurally distinct, adhering strictly to the following instructions:

1. **Preserve all function and class names exactly as in the original**, including their full hierarchy and object-oriented relationships; do not change method signatures or class inheritance.

2. **Output only valid, runnable pseudocode** that can stand alone without any additional explanation, comments, or textual notes.

3. **Transform all other code elements aggressively and creatively to maximize difference while maintaining behavior**, including but not limited to:

   - Change loop styles: convert `for` loops to `while` loops, iterative loops to recursion (where recursion depth is safe), or comprehension-style constructs if supported.

   - Alter conditionals: replace `if-else` chains with guard clauses, early returns, switch/case blocks, ternary-like conditional expressions, or rearranged conditional logic.

   - Rename all variables and parameters (except functions/classes) to new, semantically neutral identifiers, ensuring no semantic leakage from the original names.

   - Reorder independent statements or expressions when it does not affect outcome.

   - Use logically or arithmetically equivalent but syntactically different expressions (e.g., replace addition with subtraction of negative, use alternative modulo equivalent expressions).

   - Substitute data containers with equivalent types (arrays, lists, sets, dictionaries) as allowed by the logic.

   - Restructure nested loops into pipeline-style iterations or incorporate map/filter/reduce conceptual equivalents.

   - Separate or combine statements judiciously to avoid altering semantics but enhance structural divergence.

   - Vary indentation, whitespace, and line-break patterns substantially to differ from the original style.

4. **Strictly maintain all original input-output mappings and side effects without deviation.** The rewritten pseudocode must behave identically in every scenario.

5. **Do not introduce any external modules, libraries, language-specific features, or constructs not originally supported by the pseudocode's paradigm.**

6. **Avoid deep or unbounded recursion; if recursion is used, ensure clear, safe, and minimal depth termination conditions to prevent overflow in practical input ranges, preferring iterative solutions when recursion risks stack issues.**

7. **Eliminate only genuinely dead code or redundant checks if and only if guaranteed not to change any externally visible behavior or outputs.**

Present only the transformed pseudocode as your final output, maximizing structural and syntactic variance while maintaining flawless functional equivalence and preserved naming of all functions and classes.
