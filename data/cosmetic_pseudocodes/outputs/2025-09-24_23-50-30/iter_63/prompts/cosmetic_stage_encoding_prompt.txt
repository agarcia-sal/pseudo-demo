Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a new version that is completely functionally equivalent and behaviorally indistinguishable, while maximizing all possible syntactic, structural, and naming divergences, subject to these strict rules:

1. **Preserve Identifiers:**
   - Keep all **function names**, **class names**, as well as their **nesting and inheritance structures** (including exact spelling and casing) **unchanged** and at exactly the same scope.
   
2. **Rename All Other Identifiers:**
   - Replace all other identifiers—such as local variables, parameters, intermediate values, constants, and temporaries—with freshly generated, consistent, semantically neutral names that do not collide in their scopes.

3. **Exact Semantic Preservation:**
   - The rewritten pseudocode must match the original’s behavior precisely, including side effects, input-output relationships, termination, error handling, and correctness.
   - Do not add or remove any functionality.
   - Remove unreachable or truly redundant code **only if** it does not alter any observable behavior.

4. **Transform Control Flow Intensively:**
   - Convert any loops (for, while, repeat-until) into functionally equivalent recursive or tail-recursive procedures or comprehensions, and vice versa.
   - Substitute conditional expressions—if-else chains, nested conditionals, guards—with logically equivalent constructs such as switch/case, nested ternaries, De Morgan transformations, boolean factoring, or short-circuits.
   - Reorder, split, combine, or restructure blocks and statements arbitrarily, so long as behavior remains identical.

5. **Vary Data Representations:**
   - Where semantic equivalence holds, switch among data structures (lists, arrays, sets, maps, linked forms) to diversify structural form without changing correctness.

6. **Rewrite Expressions Thoroughly:**
   - Change arithmetic and logical expressions into equivalent forms using algebraic identities, different evaluation orders, factoring, constant folding, boolean negation/normalization, short-circuits, etc.

7. **Intensive Surface Level Alterations:**
   - Aggressively change formatting styles: vary indentation depth and style, line breaks, spacing, statement ordering (where order of independent statements permits).
   - Apply alternative idioms or equivalent constructs available in pseudocode to maximize orthogonality.

8. **No New Paradigms or Language Features:**
   - Do not introduce concepts, constructs, or paradigms not present in the original pseudocode.

9. **Output Requirements:**
   - Output **only the transformed pseudocode**—no comments, explanations, or any text besides pseudocode.
   - Ensure all code is complete, syntactically valid pseudocode conforming to the original’s structural style.

Your goal: produce a maximally orthogonal pseudocode version that preserves full semantic equivalence, keeps all interface and naming constraints intact, eliminates any possible livelocks or recursion depth traps by converting to appropriate iteration where necessary, and significantly diverges in syntax, structure, and naming from the original input.
