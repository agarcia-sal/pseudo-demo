Rewrite the provided pseudocode to produce a functionally identical but maximally transformed version, adhering strictly to the following rules:

- **Output ONLY valid, self-contained pseudocode**, containing the complete rewritten program; do NOT include explanations, commentary, or any text outside the pseudocode itself.

- Keep **all original function names, class names, and the exact class/object/inheritance and nesting hierarchy unchanged** (including exact spelling and casing, and their exact placement in the code).

- Rename **only internal identifiers** (variables, parameters, constants, temporaries, etc.) to unrelated, semantically neutral, consistent alternatives within their scopes, avoiding all name collisions.

- Apply aggressive, combined, and layered transformations to maximize syntactic, structural, and stylistic novelty **without changing any external observable behavior or semantics**, including but not limited to:

  - Control flow restructuring: freely convert loops into recursion or tail recursion and vice versa; employ comprehensions, map/filter pipelines, short-circuiting guards, switch/case in place of if-else chains, nested/guard expressions, ternary or conditional expressions; reorder independent statements or blocks; split or merge code blocks harmlessly.
  
  - Boolean and conditional logic: rewrite using logically equivalent but differently structured expressions (e.g., De Morganâ€™s laws, distribution, factoring, negation movement), reorganize conditions, replace chained if-elses with switch/case or pattern matching styles if applicable.
  
  - Data structure transformations: where semantics allow, interchange equivalent representations (lists, arrays, sets, dictionaries, linked vs indexed structures, accumulators vs reducers) without external behavior modification.
  
  - Expression rewriting: reorder operands when safe (e.g., commutative operations), refactor arithmetic and boolean expressions into equivalent forms, unfold or fold constants differently, use alternative but valid formulations for the same operations.
  
  - Formatting and style: vary indentation, line breaks, grouping, statement ordering, spacing, and line wrapping aggressively for maximal visual and structural variety.
  
  - Recursion handling: replace direct recursion prone to depth issues with equivalent iterative or tail-recursive implementations; convert tail recursion to loops; transform iterative solutions into recursive ones where it increases novelty without causing performance or semantic issues.

- Do NOT introduce any language-specific libraries, external APIs, or constructs beyond what is supported or implied by the original pseudocode paradigm.

- Remove unreachable or redundant code **only if it does not affect any external observable behavior**.

- Do NOT alter input/output formats, function signatures, or termination conditions.

- Ensure consistent and unambiguous renaming of local identifiers such that all original semantics remain intact.

- The final pseudocode should be as orthogonal and distinct as possible in syntax and structure from the original while guaranteeing perfect semantic equivalence.

Produce solely the rewritten pseudocode.
