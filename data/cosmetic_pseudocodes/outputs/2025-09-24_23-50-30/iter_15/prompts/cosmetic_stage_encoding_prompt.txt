Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a version that is **functionally indistinguishable** from the original, but **maximally divergent in all syntactic, structural, and stylistic dimensions**, adhering strictly to these rules:

1. **Retain all original function and class names verbatim**, preserving full nesting, inheritance, and class-object hierarchy exactly as given.

2. **Produce only complete, standalone pseudocode**, without any explanations, comments, or notes.

3. **Apply comprehensive transformations to every other element of the code**, including but not limited to:
   - Convert loops to recursion or recursion to loops where safe and efficient, favoring iterative methods when recursion depth risks arise.
   - Reorganize control flow: replace nested conditionals with guard clauses, switch/case, pattern matching, or equivalent logical constructs.
   - Arbitrarily rename all non-function/class identifiers (variables, parameters, constants) using semantically neutral, unused identifiers.
   - Replace direct arithmetic or logical operations with equivalent algebraic or logical expressions, including use of De Morgan’s laws or alternative numerical forms.
   - Reorder independent or commutative statements, expressions, and declarations without semantic changes.
   - Substitute data structures with alternative ones that preserve exact behavior and performance characteristics (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ queues as appropriate).
   - Split complex statements into multiple simpler ones or merge multiple simple statements into fewer compound forms.
   - Vary formatting extensively: indent differently, reorder blank lines, change line breaks, capitalize differently as allowed by pseudocode conventions.
   - Use alternate ways to express the same operations, e.g., "INCREMENT by 1" vs "ADD 1", "IS EQUAL TO" vs "=".
   - Re-implement helper functions or subroutines differently but equivalently, ensuring no function call signatures or names change.
   - Remove any dead code, redundant branches, or unnecessary operations only if the output and side effects are strictly preserved.

4. **Preserve all I/O behavior and side effects exactly**, ensuring semantic equivalence in all inputs, outputs, and observable effects.

5. **Do NOT introduce any language-specific syntax, platform dependencies, or foreign paradigms**—use only structures and idioms consistent with the pseudocode style provided.

6. **When recursion is used, ensure termination is guaranteed and stack overflow is avoided; prefer iterative transformations if original recursion risks failure or timeout.**

7. Output only the transformed pseudocode. Avoid any text outside the code blocks.

This prompt demands the utmost syntactic and structural variation while safeguarding perfect functional parity, to maximize difference from the input pseudocode without functional regression.
