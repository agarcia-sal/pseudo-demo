Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally identical but syntactically and structurally maximally divergent form, strictly following these requirements:

- **Preserve all original function and class names exactly**, including their hierarchy, inheritance, and organization. Do not alter any class or function signatures.

- Output **only valid, self-contained pseudocode**, without any comments, explanations, or meta-text.

- Achieve maximal transformation by extensively changing every other element of the pseudocode. This includes but is not limited to:
  - Replacing loops with recursion or recursion with loops, or employing alternative iteration patterns (e.g., comprehensions, map/filter pipelines), ensuring no risk of recursion depth errors.
  - Modifying control structures by introducing guard clauses, switch/case, early returns, or restructuring conditionals without changing logic.
  - Renaming all non-function/class identifiers (variables, parameters) with fresh, semantically neutral names different from the original.
  - Reordering statements and expressions where order does not impact semantics.
  - Using logically equivalent but syntactically distinct arithmetic and logical expressions.
  - Switching between equivalent data container types or representations (e.g., arrays vs. lists, sets, or dictionaries) where feasible.
  - Splitting compound statements into multiple lines or merging lines where valid.
  - Altering all stylistic aspects such as indentation style, keywords phrasing, line breaks, and spacing extensively.

- Maintain **strict semantic equivalence**: the transformed pseudocode must produce identical outputs and side effects for all inputs, including handling of edge cases and error conditions.

- Retain termination conditions exactly for recursive processes; prefer iterative alternatives if original recursion depth risks exceeding practical limits.

- Remove any dead code, redundant conditions, or unnecessary operations only if they do not affect functional correctness or observable behavior.

- Avoid introducing constructs or syntax that are not valid pseudocode or that depend on external libraries, language-specific features, or paradigms not reflected in the original pseudocode.

Your output must be exclusively the rewritten pseudocode, exhibiting maximal syntactic, structural, and naming divergence, flawlessly preserving original behavior.
