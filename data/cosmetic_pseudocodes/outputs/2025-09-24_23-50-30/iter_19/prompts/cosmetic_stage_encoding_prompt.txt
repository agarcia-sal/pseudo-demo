Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a version that:

- **Retains all original function and class names exactly as they are, keeping the class and object hierarchies, inheritance, and all structural relationships unmodified.**

- **Outputs only valid pseudocode without any explanatory text, comments, or annotations.**

- **Maximally diverges in all other dimensions while strictly preserving semantic equivalence and exact input/output behavior, including side effects.** To achieve this, apply extensive transformations such as:

  - Convert loops to recursion or vice versa, or use comprehensions and functional constructs when possible; avoid recursion depth risks by preferring iteration for deep or unbounded recursion.

  - Replace standard control structures with alternative logic forms, e.g., use guard clauses, switch/case, ternary expressions, early returns, or nested conditions rearranged, while keeping behavior identical.

  - Rename all local variables, parameters, and temporary identifiers to semantically neutral, unrelated names, ensuring no collisions with original function or class names.

  - Reorder independent instructions or combine/split statements logically, without affecting semantics or evaluation order where order is significant.

  - Substitute equivalent arithmetic/logical expressions, e.g., use addition/subtraction or distributive transformations, alternate modulo formulations, boolean negations, identity rewrites, and other algebraic/logical equivalences.

  - Swap equivalent data structures for storage or iteration (arrays ⇄ lists ⇄ sets) and use different iteration or collection-building techniques such as map/filter pipelines, internal iterators, or unfolded recursion.

  - Alter formatting radically: change indentation styles, line breaks, grouping, and block delimiters without breaking pseudocode validity.

  - Remove any redundant, dead, or pointless operations only if they do not affect any observable effects or outputs.

- **Avoid introducing any constructs, libraries, or syntax elements foreign to the original pseudocode paradigm.**

Your output must be strictly **pseudocode only** that fulfills these constraints and achieves the largest possible syntactic and structural departure from the input, yet behaves identically.
