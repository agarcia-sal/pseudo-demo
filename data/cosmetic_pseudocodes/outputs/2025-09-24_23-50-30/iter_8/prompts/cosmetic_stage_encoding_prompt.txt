Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally identical but syntactically and structurally maximally distinct version. Follow these strict guidelines:

1. **Preserve exact function names, class names, and the full class/object hierarchy and structure (including inheritance) without any change.** Do not alter visibility, scope declarations, or signatures.

2. The output must consist solely of valid pseudocode. **No explanatory text, comments, annotations, or meta-descriptions** are allowed—only deliver the rewritten pseudocode.

3. Maximize transformation across all other aspects, including but not limited to:
   - Completely reframe control flow using alternative constructs: replace recursion with iteration and vice versa, switch from loops to comprehensions or streams, or employ guard clauses and switch/case where possible.
   - Rename *all* non-function/class identifiers (variables, parameters, temporaries) to new, semantically neutral, and unique names irrelevant to their original identifiers.
   - Where order of independent statements can be changed without affecting behavior, reorder them for divergence.
   - Replace equivalent arithmetic, logical, and comparison expressions with alternative formulations that yield the same results (for example, use subtraction instead of addition to compute complements, logical DeMorgan transformations, off-by-one loop boundaries adjusted accordingly, etc.)
   - Use alternative but semantically equivalent data structures and algorithms where feasible, e.g., arrays ↔ lists, while loops ↔ for loops, nested loops ↔ map/filter pipelines.
   - Merge multiple simple statements into compound ones and vice versa, split expressions if it improves divergence.
   - Alter formatting significantly: indentation style, line breaking, and compound statement layouts.
   - Rearrange helper functions or inner function definitions without changing execution logic or scope.
   - Optimize recursive algorithms to iterative forms if recursion risks exceeding plausible depth; ensure termination logic remains unaltered.
   - Remove any redundant or dead code *only if* the input-output behavior and side effects remain unchanged.
   - Ensure avoidance of any constructs, dependencies, or syntax that are not consistent across the style and paradigm of the original pseudocode.

4. The rewritten pseudocode must produce exactly the same outputs, side effects, and observable behavior for *any* valid input as the original.

5. The output should be robust and self-contained pseudocode that could be reasonably implemented in any general procedural or object-oriented language.

**Output ONLY the fully transformed pseudocode conforming to these criteria.**
