Rewrite the provided pseudocode to produce a new, fully functional version that meets all of the following conditions precisely:

1. **Preserve all function and class names exactly as in the original, including their inheritance, nesting, and organizational structure.** Do not modify these identifiers or alter the class/object hierarchy.

2. The output must contain **only the transformed pseudocode itself; do not include any explanations, comments, or metadata of any kind.**

3. Achieve **maximum syntactic and structural difference** from the original pseudocode while retaining **complete functional equivalence** and identical observable behavior, including inputs, outputs, and side effects. To do this, you must apply aggressive transformations such as (but not limited to):

   - Convert iterative constructs into recursion or recursion into iteration where feasible and safe, favoring iterative forms if recursion depth might be excessive.
   
   - Replace standard control flow (e.g., if-else) with alternate idioms: guard clauses, switch/case structures, early returns, or equivalent logical rearrangements.
   
   - Rename all variable and parameter names except for functions and classes, using semantically neutral, unrelated names that do not collide with original identifiers.
   
   - Reorder independent statements or expressions wherever the semantics allow, including rearranging initialization and accumulation steps.
   
   - Substitute arithmetic, logical, and relational expressions with equivalent but different formulations (e.g., use subtraction instead of addition with negatives, De Morgan’s laws, alternate modulo checks).
   
   - Swap data structures to equally suitable alternatives (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets) and reformulate nested loops as pipelines, comprehensions, or accumulations.
   
   - Merge simple multiple statements into compound forms or expand compound statements into distinct steps.
   
   - Modify formatting deliberately—alter indentation style, line breaks, spacing, and block delimiters—to create a distinct visual style while remaining valid pseudocode.
   
   - Where applicable, inline or extract helper computations, transform local variables into inline expressions or vice versa, and re-express conditionals using equivalent boolean logic.

4. **Safeguard correctness and termination:** ensure recursive reshaping respects original base cases and avoids infinite recursion or stack overflow; perform tail-call style or iteration when needed.

5. **Eliminate any unreachable code, redundant conditions, or superfluous temporary variables only when doing so does not change any external behavior or side effects.**

6. **Do not introduce any elements, keywords, or syntax extending beyond the original pseudocode paradigm or that imply dependencies external to the original code’s assumptions.**

Produce solely the restructured pseudocode implementing all of the above instructions, maximizing divergence while perfectly preserving original functionality and interface.
