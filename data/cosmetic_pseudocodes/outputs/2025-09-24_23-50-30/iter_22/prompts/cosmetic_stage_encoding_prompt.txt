Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a version that preserves exact functional behavior, strictly maintaining original function and class names along with their complete hierarchy and structure, but differs as much as possible in all other respects.

Requirements:

1. **Function and class names must remain identical** with no modification in casing or spelling, and the class/object structure, inheritance, and nesting must exactly match the original.

2. The output must consist solely of valid, self-contained pseudocode that would realistically represent the original logic in an alternative style; no explanations, comments, or extra text may be included.

3. Maximize syntactic and structural divergence by applying extensive transformations, including but not limited to:

   - Convert loops to recursion or recursion to loops, or replace with alternative iteration patterns (e.g., comprehensions, filter/map pipelines).
   
   - Replace conditional constructs with logically equivalent but structurally distinct forms (ternary expressions, guard clauses, switch/case variants, nested vs. flat conditions).
   
   - Rename all variable and parameter identifiers (except function/class identifiers) to unrelated semantically neutral alternatives, ensuring no conflicts and consistent usage.
   
   - Change data structures to analogous but different types (arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets, linked structures ↔ indexed structures) when semantics allow.
   
   - Rearrange independent statements, merge or split statements logically, and vary statement ordering where semantic equivalence permits.
   
   - Employ logically equivalent but distinct arithmetic or logical expressions (e.g., `x + 1` ↔ `1 + x`, `!(a AND b)` ↔ `(!a) OR (!b)`).
   
   - Alter formatting extensively: indentation style, line breaks, grouping, spacing, and ordering to contrast with the source.
   
   - For recursive methods, if original recursion risks exceeding typical stack limits, prefer iterative solutions or tail-recursive reformulations to avoid overflow while preserving correctness.

   - Remove any unreachable or redundant code only if it does not alter observable behavior.

4. Disallow introducing any constructs or dependencies outside the paradigm and basic idioms represented in the original pseudocode (e.g., no language-specific libraries or features not implied by the pseudocode source).

5. All input-output behavior, side effects, state mutations, and termination properties must be strictly preserved in all cases, with no exceptions.

Produce only the fully transformed pseudocode reflecting the above criteria, optimizing for maximal syntactic and structural novelty while flawlessly maintaining original semantics and correctness.
