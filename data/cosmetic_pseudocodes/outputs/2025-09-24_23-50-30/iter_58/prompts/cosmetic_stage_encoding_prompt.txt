Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally equivalent and semantically indistinguishable variant that strictly adheres to these detailed requirements:

1. **Preserve all behaviors exactly:** This includes input-output relationships, side-effects, state changes, termination, exception handling, and correctness under all inputs.

2. **Keep all original function names, class names, and the full class/object nesting and inheritance hierarchy intact and unaltered.** Their exact spelling and casing must remain the same; do not rename or reorder them.

3. **Transform all other identifiers** (including parameters, local variables, loop indices, constants, temporaries) by systematically replacing them with fresh, non-meaningful, unique names that do not shadow or collide anywhere in their scope and remain consistent throughout.

4. **Rewrite the pseudocode exclusively; output no explanations, comments, metadata, or any text outside the valid pseudocode.**

5. **Maximize structural and syntactic dissimilarity by applying a rich combination of the following transformations wherever semantics permit, without changing functionality:**

   - Convert iterative loops to equivalent recursion or tail-recursion; convert recursive or tail-recursive functions to iterative loops; employ comprehensions, generator-style sequences, or pipeline abstractions when possible.

   - Substantially reorganize conditional logic by transforming between if-else chains, switch/case statements, nested guards, and boolean expression rewrites—including De Morgan’s laws, logical equivalences, and reformatting compound conditions—while preserving exact semantics.

   - Replace data structures with alternative but behaviorally equivalent forms: e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ linked structures ↔ sets (where order and duplicates semantics allow), or alter indexing strategies and storage representations without affecting logic.

   - Reorder, coalesce, or split blocks and statements freely provided observable behaviors remain unchanged, including reassociating expressions, refactoring arithmetic or boolean operations, or factoring differently.

   - Aggressively vary formatting: indentation depth, line breaks, whitespace, statement grouping, and ordering of independent operations where permissible.

   - Inline small functions or extract repeated code sections into helper constructs, as long as the observable interface and behavior remain exactly the same.

   - Simplify or unfold constant expressions, distributive factoring, and neutral element removals that do not alter functional output.

   - Replace literal values with equivalent expressions (e.g., `0` → `1 - 1`, `true` → `not false`) and vice versa when appropriate.

6. **Convert recursive calls that risk deep stack usage into iterative or tail-recursive equivalents to prevent overflow, without changing observable behavior or semantics.**

7. **Do not add, remove, or generalize functionality beyond the original scope. No calls to external libraries or language-specific features beyond those expressed in the original pseudocode are permitted.**

8. **Remove unreachable or dead code only if it is provably redundant and guaranteed not to affect any externally observable behavior.**

Output must contain solely the fully transformed pseudocode, maintaining all original program structure identifiers intact, but otherwise rewritten to be as syntactically and structurally distinct as possible while preserving semantics perfectly.
