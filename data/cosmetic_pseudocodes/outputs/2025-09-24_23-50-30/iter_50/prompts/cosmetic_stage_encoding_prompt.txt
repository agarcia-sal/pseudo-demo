Rewrite the given pseudocode into a version that is functionally and behaviorally **completely equivalent** to the original but **maximally distinct in syntax and structure**, observing these strict rules:

1. **Output only valid, complete pseudocode** that implements the original program exactly — no explanations, comments, or any extra text.

2. **Do not change** any original **function names, class names, nesting, inheritance hierarchies, or signatures** — these must remain identical in spelling and casing, preserving all interfaces.

3. **Rename all other identifiers** (local variables, parameters, constants, temporaries) to freshly generated, unrelated, semantically neutral names. These new names must be unique within their scope and consistent throughout their usage, with zero collisions.

4. Apply **multiple combined, diverse, non-trivial transformations** to maximize difference from the original in every dimension, including but not limited to:

   - Control flow: Convert iterative loops (for/while) into recursion (preferably tail-recursion or iterative with explicit stacks), or vice versa; use functional iterator constructs or comprehensions where plausible.

   - Conditionals: Reorganize conditional branching by transforming if-else chains into switch/case or nested guards, apply boolean algebra and De Morgan’s laws to rewrite conditions, restructure and reorder branches without semantic change.

   - Data structures: Substitute equivalent forms where semantics allow (e.g., arrays ⇄ lists ⇄ sets; linked structures ⇄ indexed arrays) while preserving all behavior.

   - Statement and block structure: Arbitrarily reorder, merge, or split statements and blocks, introducing logically equivalent but syntactically distinct groupings.

   - Expressions: Rewrite arithmetic and boolean expressions to equivalent but syntactically different forms (reordering operations, factoring, introducing temporary terms, constant folding/unfolding variants).

   - Formatting: Vary indentation, line breaks, spacing, and statement delimiters extensively to maximize surface-level difference.

   - Recursion and iteration: Replace deep recursive calls with safe iterative or tail-recursive constructs explicitly designed to avoid stack overflows, preserving exact semantics.

5. **Do not add or remove any functionality or language features beyond what already exists** in the original pseudocode paradigm.

6. Remove unreachable or redundant code **only if that does not affect visible behavior or outputs in any case**.

7. Rigorously preserve **all original side effects, termination behavior, input-output contracts, and correctness properties**—the transformed pseudocode must pass all semantic correctness tests identically.

Your output should be a **single, self-contained pseudocode block representing the entire transformed program**, strictly following all above constraints to achieve **maximum semantic equivalence with maximal syntactic and structural novelty**.
