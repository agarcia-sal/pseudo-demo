Rewrite the given pseudocode to produce a functionally equivalent version that meets all the criteria below:

- **Preserve exactly and without exception:**  
  - All function names (identifiers and casing)  
  - All class names (identifiers and casing)  
  - The precise class/object nesting, composition, and inheritance hierarchy (including method placements)  
  - The original input-output behavior, side-effects, state changes, and termination conditions

- **Output only valid, self-contained pseudocode** that fully implements the original algorithm. Do **not** include any comments, explanations, or any text besides the pseudocode itself.

- **Systematically rename every other user-defined identifier** (variable names, parameter names, loop counters, temporary variables, constants) to new, unrelated, semantically neutral names, avoiding:  
  - Any reuse or collision within the same scope or overlapping scopes  
  - Preservation of original semantic or mnemonic hints  
  Names must be consistently replaced everywhere they appear in the same scope.

- **Maximize structural, syntactic, and stylistic deviation** from the original code by applying thorough, combined, and semantically sound transformations, including but not limited to:  
  - Switching between recursion, tail recursion, iteration (for/while), comprehensions, filter/map pipelines, or equivalent constructs capable in pseudocode  
  - Re-expressing conditional logic with diverse forms such as if-else chains, switch/case, nested conditions, ternary/guarded expressions, De Morgan’s laws, truth table equivalences, or logically equivalent boolean expressions reordered or refactored  
  - Transforming data structures into semantically equivalent alternatives (e.g., sets to lists or arrays, arrays to linked structures), provided behavior does not change  
  - Merging, splitting, or reordering statements and blocks in ways that do not impact behavior or order-dependent effects  
  - Using algebraic and logical equivalences to rewrite expressions (e.g., commutation, associativity, distributivity, double negation elimination, factorization)  
  - Aggressively reformatting code with unconventional but valid indentations, line breaks, grouping, ordering of statements and expressions to increase syntactic noise  
  - Converting recursion prone to stack overflows into tail-recursion or iterative solutions, and, conversely, rewriting iterative loops as recursive functions where feasible  
  - Removing redundant or unreachable code only if guaranteed to have zero effect on external behavior or output

- Do **not** introduce new pseudocode features, constructs, or external libraries beyond those logically implied by the original code’s paradigm and style.

- Preserve all original **semantic and correctness guarantees** exactly—your rewritten pseudocode must behave identically in every aspect.

Your output must be ONLY the rewritten pseudocode preserving all the above constraints and maximizing the divergence from the original’s syntax and surface structure while perfectly maintaining its semantics.
