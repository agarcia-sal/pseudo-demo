Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a functionally equivalent version that is maximally different in form, structure, and style by following these explicit instructions:

- **Preserve all function and class names exactly as in the original.** Maintain the original class hierarchy, inheritance, and nesting without any alteration or reordering at the class or function level.

- **Omit all explanations, comments, annotations, or meta-text.** Output only valid pseudocode reflecting the original logic and behavior.

- Transform every other aspect of the pseudocode as extensively as possible to maximize syntactic and structural divergence, including but not limited to:

  - Replace loops with recursion or recursion with loops, except where recursion could cause excessive call depth—then convert to iteration.

  - Use alternate control flow structures: convert if-else to guard clauses, switch/case, or early returns; rearrange conditions logically without altering semantics.

  - Rename all variable and parameter identifiers (other than function/class names) to new, semantically neutral names that are distinct from the originals.

  - Change data structures to different but functionally equivalent ones (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets, flatten nested loops into map/filter style pipelines, merge or split statements).

  - Reorder statements and expressions whenever independence allows, ensuring the original functional outcome is unchanged.

  - Express arithmetic and logical operations with equivalent—but different—formulations, including using distributive, associative, or commutative properties, alternative expressions for comparisons, and boolean algebra transformations.

  - Alter formatting profoundly: vary indentation styles, line breaks, statement grouping, and spacing conventions.

  - Remove any code identified as dead, redundant, or unnecessary only if its removal does not affect the observable behavior or output.

- **Strictly preserve the semantics, side effects, and input-output behavior** of the original pseudocode. Any alteration must be transparently equivalent from the perspective of correctness and performance.

- **Avoid introducing new language-specific constructs, external libraries, or paradigm changes outside the original pseudocode's scope, style, and conventions.**

- For recursive logic, ensure termination conditions match those in the original; if recursion depth could cause runtime errors, prefer an iterative equivalent transformation.

- Output only the transformed pseudocode text. Do not include any extra explanations or text beyond the pseudocode.

- This prompt applies universally, regardless of problem domain or pseudocode content.

Your goal is to maximize the surface-level difference from the original pseudocode without sacrificing correctness or introducing errors.
