Rewrite the provided pseudocode into a semantically equivalent but substantially transformed version that passes **all original correctness criteria, side-effects, input-output behaviors, and termination guarantees**, preserving **exactly the same function names, class names, and their full structural hierarchy, nesting, and inheritance**, including identical spelling and casing.

**Requirements and transformation guidelines:**

- Output solely valid, standalone pseudocode; do not include explanations, comments, notes, or annotations.

- Keep all function and class identifiers unchanged in name, location, and structure (including nesting and inheritance), but rename **all other identifiers (variables, parameters, constants, temporaries) consistently to unrelated, semantically neutral names** to avoid collisions and retain scope consistency.

- Employ extensive, composite, and orthogonal syntactic and structural transformations to maximize novelty relative to the original pseudocode, including (but not limited to):

  - Convert iterative loops (for, while) to recursion or tail recursion and vice versa, or to equivalent functional-style compositions (e.g., map, filter, reduce, comprehensions) where pseudocode paradigm permits.

  - Rewrite conditionals, replacing if-else chains with switch/case, multi-way guards, nested conditionals, logically equivalent boolean expressions, De Morgan transformations, or ternary-style expressions.

  - Transform data structures among semantically equivalent forms (e.g., arrays ↔ lists ↔ sets; linked vs indexed structures) provided behavior remains identical.

  - Shuffle, merge, or split statements and code blocks without semantic changes; reorder independent operations to maximize surface-level difference.

  - Substitute all arithmetic and logical expressions with logically equivalent alternatives (e.g., reordering operands in commutative operations, alternative constant folding, applying boolean algebra equivalences).

  - Change formatting radically with deliberate variation in indentation styles, line breaks, and statement grouping to maximize syntactic distance.

  - Replace any recursion prone to depth limits with iterative or tail-recursive versions to avoid overflow, or vice versa, preserving exact semantics.

- Do not add any new language-specific constructs, features, or external library calls beyond those implicitly allowed by the original pseudocode paradigm.

- Remove redundant or unreachable code **only if** doing so does not alter any externally observable behavior or side effects.

Produce only this rewritten pseudocode fulfilling all constraints, optimized to maximize structural, lexical, and syntactic divergence from the input code while maintaining complete semantic fidelity.
