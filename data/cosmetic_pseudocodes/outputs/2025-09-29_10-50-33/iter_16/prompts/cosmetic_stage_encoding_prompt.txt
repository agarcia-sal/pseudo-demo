Given any input pseudocode, generate a **semantically equivalent** version of the pseudocode that is maximally different from the original in **syntax, style, flow, naming, and structure**, subject to these precise rules:

- **Keep all original function names and signatures exactly the same**, including all parameter names, order, and their scopes — no renaming or reordering of functions or parameters.

- **Keep all original class names, inheritance, nesting, and containment hierarchies exactly as they are**, with no modification, renaming, or restructuring of classes or objects.

- For **all other identifiers** (local variables, parameters *inside function bodies*, temporaries, iterators, accumulators, containers), rename them thoroughly, systematically, and consistently to fresh, *meaningfully distinct* identifiers bearing no resemblance or shared tokens with the originals.

- Rewrite the entire program body to maximize **syntactic and stylistic divergence** while preserving semantics, by applying **comprehensive, layered transformations**, including but not limited to:

  - **Control flow transformations:** interchange loop constructs (FOR, WHILE, DO-WHILE, recursion), replace conditionals with equivalent alternate styles (nested conditions, guard clauses, pattern matching, switch-like constructs, early returns, boolean algebra rewrites with inversions and De Morgan’s laws).

  - **Expression-level rewrites:** reorder, expand/factor, invert, transform operators, use alternative notations (prefix, infix, postfix), replace direct comparisons with logically equivalent negations or alternate forms, rewrite arithmetic and boolean expressions creatively.

  - **Data structures:** convert container types and data representations (sets to lists, arrays to tuples), swap implicit and explicit iteration, use filters, map, reduce, or iterator patterns, index-based vs element-based loops.

  - **Parameter passing and calls:** use named arguments if originally positional and vice versa when allowed, destructure tuples where feasible, reorder independent parameters internally without changing signature, reorder function arguments at call sites if safe.

  - **Syntax and keyword variations:** replace common keywords with less conventional or custom pseudocode alternatives (e.g., EXECUTE, INVOKE, REPEAT...UNTIL, BREAK for RETURN), vary indentation styles (spaces, tabs, mixed), vary line breaks and statement layouts (inline, multiline, chained), alter spacing arbitrarily.

  - **Code block and statement reorganization:** reorder logically independent blocks and statements, inline short helper functions, split complex statements, merge simple statements, alter statement grouping and nesting depth extensively.

  - **Literal and constant rewriting:** express constants via equivalent alternative forms (e.g., 0 as FALSE, empty string as '' or NIL), rewrite literals as expressions with equivalent value, vary string literal delimiters or concatenation methods.

- **Strictly prohibit** any alteration or disruption of function and class name identifiers, their order, or their exact nesting and inheritance — these must be preserved unchanged to keep interface integrity intact.

- The output must contain **only the rewritten pseudocode**, with no comments, explanations, delimiters, metadata, or any other text.

- The overall output program must preserve **identical functional behavior, side effects, outputs, and interface signatures** to the input pseudocode, differing only in internal naming (except for function/class identifiers), syntax, structure, and flow organization.

Your goal is to produce a version of the pseudocode that looks like an independently authored, novel implementation that is extremely unlikely to be syntactically or stylistically confused with the input code, while matching the original program’s semantics **perfectly**.

Output exactly and only the rewritten pseudocode text.
