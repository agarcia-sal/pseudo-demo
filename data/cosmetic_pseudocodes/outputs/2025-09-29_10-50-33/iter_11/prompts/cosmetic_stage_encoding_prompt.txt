Given any input pseudocode, produce a fully semantically equivalent pseudocode version that is maximally and systematically divergent in surface form while strictly preserving all original function and class names with their exact nesting, inheritance, and organizational structures. Your output must consist solely of the transformed pseudocode text—no explanations, comments, delimiters, metadata, or annotations.

To maximize syntactic, stylistic, and structural novelty, apply aggressive, comprehensive, and multi-level transformations as follows:

1. **Preserve Identifiers with Exact Hierarchy:**  
   Retain all original function and class names verbatim, maintaining their exact nesting and inheritance relationships without any renaming, removal, or reordering.

2. **Complete Variable and Parameter Renaming:**  
   Rename *all* local variables, parameters, temporary names, loop indices, and intermediate identifiers with new, semantically plausible names bearing no lexical overlap with originals or each other. Only function and class identifiers remain unchanged.

3. **Control Flow Reconstruction:**  
   - Transform loops into alternatives such as recursion, tail calls, different loop constructs (FOR to WHILE, WHILE to DO-WHILE, etc.).  
   - Invert, redistribute, or logically restructure conditional statements using equivalent boolean algebra (De Morgan’s laws, distributive, associative, etc.).  
   - Replace IF-ELSE chains with switch-case style constructs, guard clauses, ternary operators, early returns, boolean short-circuiting, or equivalent logic.  
   - Flatten nested conditionals where possible or introduce nested structures in logically equivalent ways.

4. **Expression and Statement Refactoring:**  
   - Reorder independent statements and reorder or regroup conjunctive/disjunctive conditions without altering semantics.  
   - Expand or factor expressions algebraically, push negations inward/outward, and convert between operator forms (e.g., replace `≤` with `not >`, or use arithmetic identities like `x + 0 = x`).  
   - Use prefix/infix/postfix notation interchangeably where unambiguous.  
   - Convert between equivalent data access patterns, such as dot vs. bracket notation.

5. **Keyword, Syntax, and Idiom Variation:**  
   - Substitute standard keywords with uncommon but semantically equivalent pseudocode variants (e.g., use INVOKE, EXECUTE, PERFORM, REPEAT, ABORT instead of CALL, RETURN, BREAK where appropriate).  
   - Vary argument passing styles—switch between positional and named arguments, reorder arguments when behaviorally safe.  
   - Employ different control instruction styles, including implicit/explicit breaks, continues, loop labels, and exceptions mimicked in pseudocode form.

6. **Data Structure and Traversal Remapping:**  
   - Replace implicit iteration with explicit indexing and vice versa.  
   - Use alternate traversal techniques such as explicit iterators, generators, mapping, filtering, recursion, or unrolling loops.  
   - Represent equivalent data structures differently: sets as lists or tuples, arrays as linked constructs, or other semantically invariant forms.  
   - Reorder collections, function call arguments, or data initialization patterns as long as semantics remain strictly preserved.

7. **Formatting and Layout Transformation:**  
   - Vary indentation styles (spaces, tabs, inconsistent depths), line breaks, and inline versus multiline constructs arbitrarily without changing logical blocks.  
   - Rearrange spacing and blank lines for distinct visual appearance.  
   - Omit all comments or replace them entirely by restructuring code to self-explain without annotations.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**  
- Do not alter function or class identifiers or their hierarchical placement.  
- Do not retain or reuse any original local variable or parameter names.  
- Do not modify semantics, program logic, output, side effects, or interface signatures in any way.  
- Produce output strictly as pseudocode that stands alone and appears as an independently authored version of the original.

Your goal is to output a reimagined pseudocode that is syntactically and stylistically very distant from the original, yet semantically identical and structurally consistent with the original class/function scaffold.

Output only the transformed pseudocode text.
