Given any input pseudocode, generate a semantically identical pseudocode that differs maximally from the original at every possible syntactic, stylistic, and structural dimension, while strictly enforcing these constraints:

- **Function names, class names, and all hierarchical relationships (nesting and inheritance) MUST be preserved exactly as in the original pseudocode without any renaming, omission, or reordering.**

- **All other identifiers (variables, parameters, temporaries, accumulators, loop counters, etc.) MUST be renamed to fresh, contextually meaningful names with no overlap to originals.**

- The output is to be strictly the transformed pseudocode text ONLY, containing no explanations, comments, delimiters, annotations, or metadata.

Apply radical and comprehensive transformations including but not limited to:

1. **Control Flow Reengineering**  
   - Convert between all forms of iteration and branching: replace FOR loops with WHILE, REPEAT-UNTIL, or recursion; turn IF-ELSE chains to SWITCH, ternary expressions, guard clauses, or pattern matches; invert or refactor conditions through Boolean identities and logical equivalences, including De Morgan’s laws.  
   - Replace explicit return statements with alternative flow transfer keywords (e.g., BREAK, STOP, EXECUTE) where semantics allow.

2. **Identifier Renaming and Abstraction**  
   - Invent completely novel and meaningful variable and parameter names that bear no lexical relation to originals.  
   - Consistently rename all local identifiers across scopes, ensuring no reuse of original identifier tokens aside from function and class names.

3. **Statement and Expression Reconstruction**  
   - Reorder independent or commutative statements and operands.  
   - Elaborate or simplify expressions by applying arithmetic and logical equivalences (e.g., replace `a <= b` with `not (a > b)`, rewrite `x + 0` as `x`, factor/expand terms, push negations inward or outward).  
   - Switch clearly ambiguous infix expressions to prefix notation, or vice versa.  
   - Use alternate data access notations interchangeably (e.g., array[index] ↔ array.index if valid).

4. **Syntax and Keyword Diversification**  
   - Substitute common control keywords with synonymous or analogous pseudocode constructs (e.g., EXECUTE for RETURN, INVOKE for CALL, REPEAT...UNTIL replacing WHILE loops).  
   - Vary parameter passing styles (named/positional) if behaviorally safe and meaningful.  
   - Replace literal constants and container constructs with equivalent syntactic variants (e.g., sets as ordered lists, tuples, or maps).

5. **Structure and Formatting Variability**  
   - Vary indentation (spaces/tabs), line breaks, inline vs multiline mixing, and vertical spacing to produce visually distinct pseudocode blocks.  
   - Omit all comments entirely.  
   - Reorder logically independent code blocks or nested definitions while preserving program behavior and hierarchy.

6. **Data Structure and Traversal Variants**  
   - Replace implicit iteration (e.g., foreach) with explicit index-based loops, or explicit iterator patterns.  
   - Employ alternate container traversal techniques—mapping, filtering, unrolling loops, recursion, lambdas—as appropriate.  
   - Reorder safely swappable function call arguments.

**Absolutely no semantic changes are permitted**: output must preserve identical logic, side effects, outputs, and interfaces exactly.

**No changes allowed to class or function naming or their containment/nesting.**

**Output only the fully rewritten pseudocode text, no explanations or auxiliary content.**
