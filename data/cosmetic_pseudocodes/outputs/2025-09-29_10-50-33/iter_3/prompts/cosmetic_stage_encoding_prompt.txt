Given original pseudocode as input, produce a semantically equivalent pseudocode version that maximizes syntactic and stylistic divergence while strictly preserving all original function names, class names, and their exact hierarchical class/object structures. Achieve maximal difference by systematically applying all of the following transformations wherever applicable:

- Replace control flow constructs with alternative, equivalent forms (e.g., convert FOR loops to WHILE loops or recursion, switch IF-ELSE branches to guard clauses or ternary-like expressions).
- Invent new, meaningful variable names without reusing any original variable identifiers; rename loop indices, temporaries, accumulators, and parameters distinctly.
- Reorder independent statements, reorder condition checks logically without affecting behavior, and reframe expressions using equivalent operators or algebraic identities.
- Substitute control keywords with synonyms or spelling variants (e.g., USE rather than PERFORM, OBTAIN instead of GET, OTHERWISE for ELSE).
- Transform expressions by expanding or condensing complex expressions, replacing syntactic sugar with explicit constructs, or rewriting conditions as equivalent compound predicates.
- Adopt alternate formatting conventions: vary indentation style and levels, introduce or remove blank lines, switch between inline and multiline statements, change comment style or remove comments altogether.
- Use different data structure access notation or explicit indexing where implicit was used, change ordering of parameters in built-in calls if order is immaterial.
- Avoid any reuse of exact variable names or literal strings except for the mandated function and class identifiers.
- Do not add any explanation or commentary; output solely the rewritten pseudocode text without delimiting markdown or quotes.

Under no circumstances modify logic, output behavior, or external interfaces. Follow these instructions rigorously to ensure maximal syntactic difference but perfect functional equivalence, maintaining structural fidelity of function and class naming and placement.
