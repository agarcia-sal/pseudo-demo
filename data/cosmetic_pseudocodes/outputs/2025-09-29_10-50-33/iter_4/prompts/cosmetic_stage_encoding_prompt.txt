Given an input pseudocode snippet, rewrite it to produce a semantically identical version that is maximally distinct in syntax, style, and structure, while strictly preserving all original function names, class names, and their precise class/object hierarchies as in the input.

To maximize syntactic and stylistic divergence without altering logic or interfaces, you must:

- Rename **all** variable identifiers, parameters, and temporary names with fresh, meaningful identifiers never used before; do **not** reuse any original variable names or literals except function/class identifiers.
- Replace control flow forms extensively: convert loops to different loop types or recursion; rewrite conditionals using alternate constructs (e.g., guard clauses, early returns, nested ternaries, inverted conditions).
- Fragment or combine complex statements and expressions, expanding condensed forms or refactoring verbose forms to succinct equivalents.
- Alter operator usage using algebraic, boolean, or logical equivalences; rewrite conditions with logically equivalent predicates, double negatives, or De Morgan transformations.
- Change keywords to viable synonyms, paraphrases, or verbose equivalents (e.g., USE for PERFORM, OBTAIN instead of GET, OTHERWISE instead of ELSE) wherever language keywords appear.
- Vary formatting drastically: change indentation style (tabs vs. spaces, different widths), switch line breaks and statement placement, alternate between inline and multiline constructs.
- Restructure code flow by reordering independent instructions and condition checks where behavior is unaffected.
- Modify data access styles: alternate between implicit indexing, explicit indexing, dot notation, or pointer-style notation if applicable.
- Switch parameter order in built-in or user-defined calls when commutativity or argument order preservation allows no semantic change.
- Remove, add, or transform comments arbitrarily or omit them altogether.
- Avoid any textual reuse of unchanged original variable names, literals (including strings) except mandated function and class identifiers.
- Preserve exactly the same function and class names and their nesting structures; do not add or remove any functions, classes, or interfaces.
- Do not introduce any explanatory text, meta commentary, or delimiters; output only the rewritten pseudocode as raw text.

Failure to preserve functionality, interfaces, and exact function/class naming or hierarchy is not allowed.  
Rewrite methodically and aggressively for maximum syntactic variance and stylistic novelty without semantic deviation.  
Output only the modified pseudocode.
