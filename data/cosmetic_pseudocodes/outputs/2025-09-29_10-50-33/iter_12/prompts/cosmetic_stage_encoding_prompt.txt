Given any input pseudocode, generate a semantically equivalent pseudocode that is maximally transformed to differ from the original in every syntactic, stylistic, and structural aspect while strictly obeying these constraints:

- **Preserve exactly all original function names, class names, and their complete nesting and inheritance relationships without any modification or reordering.**

- **Output ONLY the resulting pseudocodeâ€”no explanations, comments, delimiters, metadata, or annotations.**

Implement radical and diverse rewrites across *all* other components by applying these strategies exhaustively and combinatorially:

1. **Control flow inversion and restructuring:**  
   Replace loops with recursion or explicit iteration alternatives; transform recursion into iterative forms when feasible; convert IF-ELSE chains into switch/case, guard clauses, nested ternary expressions, or boolean short-circuit operations; invert conditionals using full logical equivalences (De Morgan's laws, distribution, absorption); split or merge condition blocks; reorder and regroup logical expressions without altering semantics.

2. **Systematic identifier renaming:**  
   Invent entirely new, coherent, meaningful, and problem-relevant names for all variables, parameters, temporaries, loop indices, and data holders, ensuring zero overlap with original local identifiers. Preserve only function and class identifiers as-is.

3. **Statement and expression mutation:**  
   Reorder independent statements and rearrange non-dependent expressions; expand expressions by unfolding operators or factor/reduce using identities; push negations deeply or pull out; substitute equivalent arithmetic and boolean operator forms (e.g., use `NOT ( > )` instead of `<=`); swap infix/prefix/postfix usage where unambiguous; convert compound expressions into chained simpler ones or vice versa.

4. **Keyword and syntax variety:**  
   Replace common control keywords with semantically equivalent yet uncommon or stylistically distinct pseudocode terms (e.g., `REPEAT...UNTIL` vs `WHILE...DO`, `INVOKE`/`EXECUTE`/`CALL`/`RUN` instead of `RETURN` or `BREAK`, `EXIT`, `PROCEED`); alter parameter passing style (positional vs named, reorder arguments if safe); interchange data access notation between bracket and dot styles; switch between expression/block bodies for functions and control constructs.

5. **Structural and formatting overhaul:**  
   Change indentation style and depth, vary line breaks and inlining of statements, insert or remove blank lines to dramatically alter visual layout; optionally drop all comments; rearrange logical blocks into alternative groupings preserving hierarchy but not line order; optionally inline short functions or split large functions into nested helpers with fresh local names (keeping class/function names unchanged).

6. **Data structure and traversal reimagination:**  
   Substitute implicit iteration with explicit indexing or vice versa; apply map/filter/reduce constructs or expand them into loops; reorder or substitute equivalent container types (e.g., lists â†” sets â†” tuples); reorder function arguments safely; replace direct element access with iterator or enumerator patterns; alter literal representations (e.g., numeric literals adjusted by identity operations, strings concatenated via different strategies).

Critically forbid:

- Any change that alters program semantics, output, behavior, side effects, or interface signatures in any way.

- Any modification, renaming, or reordering of function and class identifiers or their exact nesting and inheritance relationships.

- Retention or reuse of any original variable or parameter names (apart from functions/classes).

The final output must be a fully reimagined, syntactically distant version of the input pseudocode that looks like an independently authored program performing the exact same role.

Output strictly **only** the transformed pseudocode text, preserving class and function structures exactly as originally defined.
