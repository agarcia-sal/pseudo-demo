Given any input pseudocode, produce a semantically equivalent pseudocode that is radically rewritten to maximize syntactic, stylistic, and structural divergence from the original, strictly enforcing these rules:

- **Retain all original function and class names verbatim, preserving their exact nesting and inheritance hierarchies; no changes or reorderings of these identifiers or their hierarchical structures are allowed.**

- **Output should be precisely the transformed pseudocode alone, with no explanations, comments, delimiters, or metadata.**

Apply pervasive, creative, and diverse rewrites at all other levels, including but not limited to:

1. **Control Flow Remodeling:** Replace iterative loops with recursion or alternative iteration constructs (e.g., WHILE, DO-WHILE, recursion, or tail calls); convert IF-ELSE chains into switch-case analogues, guard clauses, ternary patterns, or boolean short-circuit expressions; invert, distribute, or restructure conditionals through logically equivalent boolean algebra transformations.

2. **Systematic Renaming:** Invent brand-new, meaningful, and contextually plausible variable and parameter names completely disjoint from the original tokens; rename all local identifiers, temporaries, loop counters, accumulators, and intermediate data holders; only the original function and class names must remain unchanged.

3. **Statement and Expression Reorganization:** Reorder independent statements and reorder or regroup conditionals and boolean tests while preserving semantics; extensively refactor expressions by expanding or factoring, pushing negations inward/outward, applying arithmetic and logical identities, and converting between equivalent operator sets (e.g., ≤ to ¬ >, +0 to identity, De Morgan’s laws).

4. **Keyword and Syntax Diversification:** Substitute standard control keywords with less common synonyms or pseudocode-style variants consistent with general pseudocode conventions (e.g., REPEAT…UNTIL, EXECUTE, INVOKE, BREAK instead of RETURN where semantically fitting); replace infix with prefix expressions or vice versa where unambiguous; swap dot notation and bracket notation for data access where valid; employ varied parameter passing styles (positional to named, reorder arguments if behaviorally safe).

5. **Structural and Formatting Variability:** Alter indentation schemes, line breaks, and inline/multiline mixing; optionally remove or transform comments into alternate styles or omit entirely; rearrange blank lines and spacing to produce distinct visual structure while retaining logical blocks.

6. **Data Structure and Access Transformation:** Swap implicit iteration mechanisms for explicit indexing and vice versa; use alternate traversal strategies (e.g., unrolling, mapping, filtering with lambdas, explicit iterator patterns); represent literals and containers in semantically equivalent but syntactically different forms (e.g., sets as lists or tuples); reorder function call arguments wherever safely permissible.

Strictly prohibit:

- Any modification to program semantics, logic, output, side effects, or interface signatures.

- Any alteration of function or class identifiers or their exact nesting relationships.

- Any reuse or retention of original variable or parameter names—except for function and class names—as this undermines maximal syntactic difference.

Your produced pseudocode must preserve the complete hierarchical class/object-function organization and produce a reimagined, syntactically distant version of the input that would appear as an independently authored program fulfilling the same role.

Output ONLY the transformed pseudocode text.
