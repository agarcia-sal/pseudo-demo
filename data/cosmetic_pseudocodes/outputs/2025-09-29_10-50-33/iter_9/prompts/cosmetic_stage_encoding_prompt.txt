Given any input pseudocode, generate a semantically identical pseudocode version that exhibits maximal syntactic, stylistic, and structural novelty, adhering strictly to these enhanced directives:

- **Function and Class Identities Preservation:** Keep all original function and class names exactly as they appear, preserving their exact nesting, inheritance, and organizational structure with zero modifications or reorderings.

- **Output Exclusivity:** Provide only the transformed pseudocode text. Omit any explanations, comments, delimiters, annotations, or formatting notes.

- **Exhaustive Syntactic Diversification:** Perform wide-ranging and inventive rewrites at every level except function and class identifiers, including but not limited to:

  1. **Control Flow Reconstruction:**  
     - Replace every loop type by a different iteration mechanism or recursion (e.g., FOR ↔ WHILE ↔ REPEAT-UNTIL ↔ tail recursion).  
     - Transform conditional statements extensively using logical equivalences: convert IF-ELSE chains into SWITCH/CASE equivalents, pattern-match guards, nested ternaries, boolean algebra re-expressions, short-circuit evaluations, or early-exit guard clauses.  
     - Apply laws like De Morgan’s, distributive/associative rearrangements, double negation elimination, and contraposition to invert and redistribute conditionals logically without changing behavior.

  2. **Local Identifier Renaming:**  
     - Invent entirely novel, meaningful, and context-aware names for all local variables, loop indices, parameters (except for original function parameters), temporaries, and auxiliary data holders, ensuring no overlap or reuse of original names or substrings thereof.  
     - Maintain consistent renaming throughout each local scope.

  3. **Statement and Expression Reordering and Refactoring:**  
     - Reorder independent statements and reorder or regroup compound conditionals and boolean expressions without altering semantics.  
     - Profoundly refactor expressions via algebraic expansion/factoring, negation pushing/pulling, replacement of arithmetic/logic operators by equivalents (e.g., ≤ by ¬ >), and replacement of constants by semantic equivalents (e.g., 0 + x → x).  
     - Convert infix expressions to prefix or postfix forms when unambiguous, and vice versa.

  4. **Diverse Syntax and Keyword Substitution:**  
     - Systematically replace common pseudocode keywords and standard statements by less conventional or alternative equivalents consistent with general pseudocode standards (e.g., EXECUTE, INVOKE, BREAK instead of RETURN or CONTINUE as applicable).  
     - Switch notation styles for data access (dot notation ↔ bracket notation) and parameter passing (positional ↔ named) whenever behaviorally sound.  
     - Transform loops and conditionals into semantically equivalent structural variants.

  5. **Structural, Formatting, and Layout Variability:**  
     - Alter indentation styles, line wrapping, spacing, and blank lines extensively to produce a distinct visual and structural appearance while preserving the logical grouping and readability of code blocks.  
     - Optionally remove all comments or transform/comment styles if any exist, but output should never contain explanatory text.

  6. **Data Structure and Traversal Reformulation:**  
     - Convert implicit iterations to explicit index-based traversals and vice versa; replace loops with map/filter/reduce paradigms if expressible in pseudocode; unroll loops or encapsulate repeated logic into helper constructs recursively or iteratively anew.  
     - Represent literals, collections, and container types in alternate, semantically identical forms (e.g., tuples ↔ sets ↔ lists), reorder elements where order is not semantically fixed.

- **Strict Prohibitions:**  
  - No changes to program semantics, side effects, output, or signature (aside from permitted parameter renamings excluding function parameters).  
  - No alteration or renaming of function or class names, their nesting, or inheritance relations.  
  - No reuse of original local variable or parameter names in any form; newly minted, disjoint identifiers only.

- **Outcome Requirements:**  
  - The output pseudocode must retain the full class and object hierarchy and function placement as the original but appear as a fully independently authored, distinctly different version fulfilling the exact same role and producing identical results.

Output ONLY the rewritten pseudocode.
