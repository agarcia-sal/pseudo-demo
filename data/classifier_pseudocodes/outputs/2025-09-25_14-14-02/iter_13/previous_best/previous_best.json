  "prompt": "Given an arbitrary pseudocode input that may represent one or more classes, functions, variables, control structures, and data manipulations, your task is to determine **with absolute precision** whether the pseudocode is **fully reproducible**, i.e., whether it can be implemented exactly as given to produce a correct, fully functioning program that passes **every unit test**, without any modification, supplementation, or correction.\n\n---\n\n### Definitive Criteria for Determining Full Reproducibility:\n\n1. **Complete and Explicit Declarations:**\n   - All functions, methods, classes, and procedures mentioned anywhere must be completely and explicitly defined within the provided pseudocode. No indirect references, hints at external code, nor assumed standard functions not defined within or explicitly available.\n   - All function signatures must include all parameters with types or clear roles, and return types if applicable.\n\n2. **Syntactically and Semantically Unambiguous Structure:**\n   - The pseudocode's syntax and structure must be sufficient to be translated into syntactically valid executable code in a straightforward way.\n   - Control flows (loops, conditionals, recursion, branching) must explicitly state iteration bounds, logical conditions, and exit points such that no ambiguity or multiple interpretations exist.\n   - Recursive calls must include base cases \u2014 clearly defined and reachable.\n\n3. **Consistent and Precise Naming:**\n   - Every variable, function, class, or object identifier must be consistently named and declared before use.\n   - No identifier is left undeclared or ambiguously introduced.\n   - Variable scopes must be inferable without assumption.\n\n4. **Explicit Variable Initialization and Type Clarity:**\n   - Every variable is initialized or assigned valid values before being used.\n   - If data types are implied, they must be clear, consistent, or explicitly stated.\n   - Data structures must specify their type, dimensions, contents (if initialized), and any modifications clearly.\n\n5. **Complete Coverage of Edge Cases:**\n   - The pseudocode must explicitly handle all typical cases and all exceptional or edge cases handled by expected unit tests (e.g., empty inputs, boundary values, unusual or maximal inputs).\n   - No unhandled conditions, partially specified branches, or implicit assumptions allowed.\n\n6. **No Contradictions, Logical Gaps, or Missing Steps:**\n   - The pseudocode cannot contain conflicting instructions, omissions, or logical shortcuts that would prevent direct implementation or cause unpredictable results.\n   - All intermediate computational steps must be fully shown or defined.\n\n7. **No Runtime or Structural Errors:**\n   - The pseudocode must be free of runtime error sources such as:\n     - Use of undefined variables or functions.\n     - Mismatched or missing returns in non-void functions.\n     - Illegal or ambiguous data structure operations (e.g., accessing out-of-bound indices without guards).\n     - Broken control flow constructs (unclosed loops, incomplete conditionals).\n   - Function and method signatures must be used consistently throughout the code.\n\n8. **Adequate for 100% Unit Test Passing:**\n   - The code must be suitable to pass **all** unit tests fully and correctly. Near misses passing only some subset do not count.\n   - It must be robust against all validated inputs per typical testing frameworks.\n\n9. **Self-Contained Implementation:**\n   - The pseudocode must contain all needed logic and components internally.\n   - No dependencies, calls, or references to external modules, libraries, or assumed runtime infrastructure beyond standard language primitives.\n\n10. **Allowance for Minor Stylistic and Formatting Variations:**\n    - Different but logically equivalent naming conventions, indentation, or minor syntax differences do not affect reproducibility.\n    - Only logic, completeness, and clarity matter.\n\n11. **Output and Evaluation Instructions:**\n    - For each pseudocode input given, output exactly one digit:\n      - `1` if the pseudocode meets **all** the above criteria \u2014 it is directly reproducible into code to pass all unit tests.\n      - `0` if it fails any criterion.\n\n    - No text, explanation, whitespace, or punctuation other than the single digit per input.\n    - Maintain exact one-to-one output order corresponding to the input pseudocode order.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Guidance for Your Evaluation:\n\n- Thoroughly parse the entire pseudocode, including nested structures and all definitions.\n- Verify presence and clarity of **all components** needed to implement the program unambiguously.\n- Confirm all variables and identifiers are declared and properly assigned before use.\n- Ensure control flows are completely defined, including all loops, recursion bases, and conditional branches.\n- Check that the pseudocode explicitly and completely handles edge cases expected by rigorous unit testing.\n- Detect no contradictions, undefined references, or missing logic blocks.\n- Confirm the pseudocode is robust, comprehensive, and consistent with itself and able to handle all conceivable valid inputs without failure.\n- Accept stylistic differences that do not impair clarity or correctness.\n- If any doubt remains about possible failing unit tests or incomplete logic, classify as `0`.\n\n---\n\n### IMPORTANT:\n\n- Your determination is strict and zero-tolerance: **Any deficiency that could cause failure of even a single unit test means output `0`.**\n- Only perfect, fully explicit, and absolutely correct pseudocode must be marked `1`.\n\n---\n\n**Example**:\n\nInput pseudocode:  \n```\nCLASS Solution  \n    FUNCTION sumToN(n)  \n        SET total TO 0  \n        FOR i FROM 1 TO n  \n            INCREMENT total BY i  \n        END FOR  \n        RETURN total  \n    END FUNCTION  \nEND CLASS\n```\n\nOutput:  \n`1`\n\n---\n\nUse the above framework to rigorously evaluate **any** pseudocode input fed to you and output exactly one digit (`1` or `0`) per input pseudocode, representing reproducibility as defined.\n\n---\n\n**REMEMBER:** *Your output is solely the digit per input, no commentary or extra output.*",
