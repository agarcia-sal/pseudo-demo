  "prompt": "Given an input pseudocode snippet representing a complete algorithm or method, analyze it critically and thoroughly to determine if it is **fully reproducible**, i.e., can be correctly implemented to **pass all unit tests under all valid inputs without failure**. Your judgment must rely exclusively on the pseudocode content and structure, ensuring no assumptions beyond what is stated. Output **1** if and only if the pseudocode meets all the rigorous criteria below; otherwise, output **0**. Provide no explanations, no commentary, no formatting\u2014only the digit 1 or 0, in the exact order of inputs.\n\n### Evaluation criteria for reproducibility determination:\n\n#### 1. Full Algorithmic Completeness and Clarity\n- The pseudocode **must explicitly define**:\n  - Algorithm entry points (functions/methods), including function signatures with clear parameters and return types if applicable.\n  - All initialization steps, variable declarations, and final outputs.\n  - Any nested or auxiliary functions, classes, or modules referenced.\n- The procedural flow must be **fully described**, allowing a straightforward and direct translation into runnable code without any missing pieces or inferred knowledge.\n- No steps may be vague, underspecified, or reference undefined or undeclared entities.\n- Class or module contexts must be properly encapsulated and consistent.\n\n#### 2. Logical Correctness and Well-Defined Control Flow\n- The control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion) is:\n  - Well-formed, deterministic, and guaranteed to terminate for every valid input.\n  - Free from infinite loops, infinite recursion, or unreachable code.\n- Branch conditions and loop bounds are well specified and logically sound.\n- Recursive calls have explicit base cases and well-defined progression toward termination.\n- Variables used in control structures are clearly initialized and properly updated.\n\n#### 3. Input and Output Specification\n- Inputs to the algorithm are explicitly identified and consistently referenced; the type/structure of inputs is clear.\n- Outputs or return values are explicitly specified, clearly indicate what the algorithm produces, and are logically consistent with the problem scope.\n- All intermediate or auxiliary data structures are explicitly declared and manipulated without ambiguity.\n\n#### 4. Robust Handling of Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions\n- Evidence of handling edge cases such as:\n  - Empty or zero-length inputs.\n  - Minimal or maximal input sizes and values.\n  - Special conditions like single elements, null/zero values, or overflow/underflow scenarios when applicable.\n- Loop and recursion base/limit cases must prevent out-of-bounds accesses, off-by-one errors, and ensure integrity of indices, counters, and accumulators.\n- Proper checks or conditions for boundary validity are present and consistent.\n\n#### 5. Absence of Runtime and Logical Errors\n- No accesses to undefined or undeclared variables.\n- No usage of invalid operations (e.g., division by zero, invalid indexing, memory mismanagement concepts).\n- No logical contradictions or steps that would cause runtime exceptions in a direct implementation.\n- Data structures and variables are consistently and correctly maintained through the pseudocode.\n\n#### 6. Determinism, Unambiguity, and Implementation-Ready Detail\n- Every operation and assignment is clearly and unambiguously defined.\n- No vague terminology, incomplete operations, or subjective shorthand that would force guesswork during implementation.\n- The pseudocode can be straightforwardly translated into a working program in any general-purpose language with no missing logic.\n\n#### 7. Naming and Structural Consistency\n- Function, method, class, and variable names are consistently used throughout without renaming conflicts.\n- All called or referenced subroutines exist and are fully defined.\n- Class or module hierarchies are logically consistent and complete.\n\n---\n\n### Output instructions:\n\n- For each pseudocode input, output exactly one digit:\n  - **1** if the pseudocode is fully reproducible\u2014conforms to all above criteria and is guaranteed to pass all test cases.\n  - **0** if the pseudocode is incomplete, ambiguous, logically flawed, missing essential steps, contains potential runtime errors, or cannot be reliably implemented to pass all tests.\n\n- Output only the digits in order, no separators, line breaks, or other characters.\n\n- Do not provide any explanations, comments, or examples\u2014strictly limit output to the digits `1` or `0`.\n\n---\n\n### Important notes to maximize accuracy and consistency in judgment:\n\n- Prioritize correctness and soundness over optimistic interpretation; if any doubt or ambiguity exists that could lead to failed tests or implementation errors, output **0**.\n\n- Treat near-complete or near-miss pseudocode that fails corner cases or has logical flaws as **0**, even if it would pass some unit tests.\n\n- Cosmetic differences or stylistic variations that do not affect correctness or completeness do not affect the outcome; these should be considered **1** if logically correct and fully specified.\n\n- Ensure that class and function names in the pseudocode are actually defined within the input; pseudocode that references undefined classes/functions is **0**.\n\n- When pseudocode lacks explicit loops or condition terminators causing possible infinite iterations, output **0**.\n\n- Any potential for runtime error (e.g., accessing invalid indices, missing input handling) immediately means **0**.\n\n---\n\nThis prompt aims to rigorously evaluate the reproducibility of pseudocode independent of domain or problem context, ensuring a high fidelity mapping between pseudocode correctness and unit test passing guarantees.\n\n**Remember: Your response to each pseudocode input MUST be solely a single digit: 1 or 0, in order received, no exceptions.**",
