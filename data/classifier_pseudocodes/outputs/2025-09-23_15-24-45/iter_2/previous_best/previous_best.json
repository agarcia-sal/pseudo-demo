Your determination must be based solely on the information contained within the pseudocode, applying the following thorough criteria:\n\n1. **Completeness and Correctness of Logic:**\n   - Confirm that the pseudocode explicitly defines the entire algorithmic procedure including initialization, processing steps, and return/output.\n   - Check that all necessary components and variables are declared and used correctly.\n   - Verify that control flow (loops, conditionals, recursion) is logically sound and terminates on all valid inputs.\n   - Identify and reject pseudocode with ambiguous, missing, or contradictory operations that prevent a consistent implementation.\n   \n2. **Input, Output, and Interface Clarity:**\n   - Ensure inputs are clearly specified, and values are accessible for all referenced operations.\n   - Check outputs are defined explicitly and correctly represent the intended result.\n   - Validate function/class definitions with proper signatures, consistent naming, and access to provided inputs.\n\n3. **Handling of Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:**\n   - Confirm presence of safeguards or logic that correctly manage potential edge cases (empty inputs, zero-length, negative/positive bounds, overflow/underflow where applicable).\n   - Ensure loops and recursion have well-defined base cases.\n   - Check for proper initialization and update of counters, indices, and accumulators to avoid off-by-one or index out-of-bound errors.\n\n4. **Absence of Logical or Runtime Errors:**\n   - Detect and reject infinite loops, unhandled exceptions, or operations that would cause runtime faults (e.g., accessing undefined variables, invalid memory access).\n   - Confirm that any data structures or auxiliary variables are properly manipulated and consistently maintained.\n\n5. **Determinism and Unambiguity:**\n   - Ensure every step is unambiguous, deterministic, and implementation-ready; no vague constructs or unspecified operations.\n   - Confirm that described operations can be directly translated into runnable code without guesswork.\n\n6. **Naming and Structural Consistency:**\n   - Validate that method and class names are consistent within the pseudocode and match usage sites.\n   - Check for the presence of all referenced methods within classes or modules.\n\n**Output instructions:**  \n- Output ONLY a single digit: **1** if the pseudocode meets all criteria for reproducibility and is guaranteed to pass all unit tests reliably.  \n- Output **0** if it is incomplete, ambiguous, logically flawed, misses essential steps, contains potential runtime errors, or cannot be reliably reproduced to pass all unit tests.\n\n**Strictly NO explanations, NO additional commentary, NO formatting\u2014only the digit 1 or 0, corresponding to each pseudocode input in the exact order received.**",
