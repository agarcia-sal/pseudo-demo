**Pseudocode**:

```
1. Start the program
2. Read a line of input from the user and remove any surrounding whitespace
   - Store the input in a variable called 'inputString'
3. Initialize a variable 'index' to 0 to track our position in 'inputString'
4. Initialize an empty string 'result' to build the output

5. While the 'index' is less than the length of 'inputString':
   a. If the character at 'inputString[index]' is a dot ('.'):
      - Append '0' to 'result'
      - Increment 'index' by 1 
   b. Else if the character following 'inputString[index]' 
      - Append '1' to 'result'
      - Increment 'index' by 2 
   c. Else:
      - Append '2' to 'result' 
      - Increment 'index' by 2 

6. After processing the input string, print the 'result'
7. End the program
```
