**Purpose:** The primary goal of the code is to convert a specific string representation of data (using dots and other characters) into a numerical string based on predefined rules.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program**
   
2. **Read Input:**
   - Get a line of text from user input and remove any leading or trailing spaces.
   - Store this input in a variable called `inputString`.

3. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter `index` to 0 to track the position in the string.
   - Create an empty string called `result` to store the numeric output.

4. **Process the String:**
   - While the `index` is less than the length of `inputString`:
     1. **Check Current Character:**
        - If the character at the current `index` of `inputString` is a dot ('.'):
          - Append '0' to `result`.
          - Increase `index` by 1.
     2. **Check Next Character:**
        - If the character at the next position (`index + 1`) is a dot ('.'):
          - Append '1' to `result`.
          - Increase `index` by 2.
     3. **Default Case:**
        - Otherwise, append '2' to `result`.
        - Increase `index` by 2.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - Display the final `result` string.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The program processes the input string character by character.
- Specific sequences of characters determine which numeric value is appended to the result.
- '0' is recorded for a single dot, '1' for two consecutive dots, and '2' for any other case.

**Example Input and Output:**
- Given an input string like ".." (two dots), the output will be "01".
- For ".-" (a dot followed by another character), the output will be "0". 

By following this pseudocode, the logic of the original code becomes clearer and more accessible to those unfamiliar with its syntax or programming constructs.
