### Summary of Purpose:
The goal of this code is to convert a specific sequence of characters into a numeric string based on predefined rules.

### Pseudocode:
```
START PROGRAM

DEFINE FUNCTION convertInputToOutput
    INITIALIZE inputString as the input from the user, stripping unnecessary spaces
    INITIALIZE index as 0
    INITIALIZE resultString as an empty string
    
    WHILE index is less than the length of inputString DO
        IF the character at inputString[index] is a dot THEN
            APPEND '0' to resultString
            INCREMENT index by 1
        ELSE
            IF the character at inputString[index + 1] is a dot THEN
                APPEND '1' to resultString
                INCREMENT index by 2
            ELSE
                APPEND '2' to resultString
                INCREMENT index by 2
            END IF
        END IF
    END WHILE
    
    PRINT resultString
END FUNCTION

CALL convertInputToOutput

END PROGRAM
```

### Comments:
- **Input Handling:** The program starts by reading a string of characters. This may be a user input from the console.
- **Character Processing:** The code examines each character and checks adjacent ones to determine what to append to the result.
- **Output Generation:** The numeric output is generated in a sequential manner based on the rules defined by the presence of the dot characters. 

### Example Structure:
The pseudocode is organized into logical blocks—starting with function definitions, followed by loops and conditionals—making it clear and easy to follow. Each operation is well-defined, providing readers with a clear understanding of how input is processed into output.
