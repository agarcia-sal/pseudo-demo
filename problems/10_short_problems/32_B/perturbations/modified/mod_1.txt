### Summary of Purpose:
The goal of this code is to convert a specific sequence of characters into a numeric string based on predefined rules.

### Pseudocode:
```
START PROGRAM

DEFINE FUNCTION convertInputToOutput
    INITIALIZE inputString as the input from the user, stripping unnecessary spaces
    INITIALIZE index as 0
    INITIALIZE resultString as an empty string
    
    // Loop through the input string until the end is reached
    WHILE index is less than the length of inputString DO
        // Check if the current character is a dot
        IF the character at inputString[index] is a dot THEN
            APPEND '0' to resultString
            INCREMENT index by 1
        ELSE
            // Check the next character after the current one
            IF the character at inputString[index + 1] is a dot THEN
                APPEND '1' to resultString
                INCREMENT index by 2
            ELSE
                APPEND '2' to resultString
                INCREMENT index by 2
            END IF
        END IF
    END WHILE
    
    // Output the resulting string
    PRINT resultString
END FUNCTION

// This represents the main flow of the program
CALL convertInputToOutput

END PROGRAM
```
