### Purpose
The goal of the code is to read a string of characters from input and convert it into a different string based on specific rules regarding characters in pairs.

### Pseudocode

1. **Initialize Input**:
   - Read a line of input and remove any unnecessary spaces.

2. **Set Up Variables**:
   - Create a variable `ind` and set it to 0 to track our position in the input string.
   - Create a variable `res` and set it to an empty string where we will store our output.

3. **Process Each Character**:
   - While `ind` is less than the length of the input string:
     - If the character at the current position `ind` is a '.' (dot):
       - Append '0' to `res`.
       - Move to the next character by increasing `ind` by 1.
     - Else if the character at the next position (`ind + 1`) is also a '.' (dot):
       - Append '1' to `res`.
       - Move forward by 2 characters by increasing `ind` by 2.
     - Else:
       - Append '2' to `res`.
       - Also move forward by 2 characters by increasing `ind` by 2.

4. **Display Output**:
   - Print the `res`.

### Comments for Clarity
- Each iteration of the while loop checks specific characters to determine the output:
  - A single dot ress in '0'.
  - Two consecutive dots yield '1'.
  - Any other combination of characters (not two dots at that moment) leads to adding '2' to the res.

### Example Structure
```
START
   READ inp
   SET ind = 0
   SET res = ""

   WHILE ind < LENGTH OF inp DO
       IF inp[ind] IS '.' THEN
           APPEND '0' TO res
           INCREASE ind BY 1
       ELSE IF inp[ind + 1] IS '.' THEN
           APPEND '1' TO res
           INCREASE ind BY 2
       ELSE
           APPEND '2' TO res
           INCREASE ind BY 2
       END IF
   END WHILE

   PRINT res
END
```

### Summary
This pseudocode provides a clear, step-by-step representation of the original code, outlining its functionality in a manner that's easy to understand for readers not familiar with programming details.
