Here is the high-level pseudocode that reflects the operations of the provided Python script:

```
FUNCTION translateInputToOutput()
    // Read a line of input from standard input and remove any surrounding whitespace
    INPUT string s FROM standard input
    INITIALIZE index i AS 0
    INITIALIZE output string ans AS an empty string

    // Process the input string until the end is reached
    WHILE i is less than the length of string s DO
        IF character at position i in s is equal to '.' THEN
            // If the current character is '.', append '0' to output
            Append '0' to output string ans
            INCREMENT index i by 1
        ELSE IF character at position i+1 in s is equal to '.' THEN
            // If the next character is '.', append '1' to output and skip the next character
            Append '1' to output string ans
            INCREMENT index i by 2
        ELSE
            // Otherwise, append '2' to output and skip the next character
            Append '2' to output string ans
            INCREMENT index i by 2
        END IF
    END WHILE

    // Output the final translated string
    PRINT output string ans
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Key Components:
- **Input/Output Clarification:** The function reads a string input from standard input and produces a string output based on conditions applied to the characters in the input.
- **Control Structures:** 
    - A `WHILE` loop iterates through the characters of the input string until all characters have been processed.
    - Conditional checks (`IF`, `ELSE IF`, `ELSE`) determine how to transform characters into the output string.
- **Operations Overview:** Depending on the characters encountered (either single dots or pairs), numeric values are constructed and appended to the output string. The index controlling the loop is incremented appropriately based on the transformed values.
