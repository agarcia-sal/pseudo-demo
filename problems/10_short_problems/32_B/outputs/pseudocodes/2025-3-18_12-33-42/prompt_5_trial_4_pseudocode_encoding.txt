**Purpose:**  
The code reads a string of characters (consisting of dots and other symbols) and translates these into a corresponding sequence of numbers based on specific rules, ultimately printing the result.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **DECLARE input_string** as an empty string to store the input from the user.
2. **READ input string** from standard input, removing any extra spaces or newlines.
3. **INITIALIZE index** to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string.
4. **INITIALIZE result_string** as an empty string to concatenate results.

5. **WHILE index is less than the length of input_string:**
   - **IF the current character at index is a dot:**  
     - Append '0' to result_string.  
     - Increase index by 1 to move to the next character.
   - **ELSE IF the next character (index + 1) is a dot:**  
     - Append '1' to result_string.  
     - Increase index by 2 to skip both current and next character.
   - **ELSE:**  
     - Append '2' to result_string.  
     - Increase index by 2 to skip both current and next character.

6. **PRINT result_string** as the final output.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The program processes the input string in a loop, translating the characters according to specific rules:
  - A single dot translates to '0'.
  - A dot followed by another dot translates to '1'.
  - Any other character pair translates to '2'.
  
**Example Input and Output:**
- **Input:** ".."  
- **Output:** "00"  
- **Input:** ".-"  
- **Output:** "01"  
- **Input:** "--"  
- **Output:** "2"  

This pseudocode effectively breaks down the entire process, emphasizing readability and clarity for anyone unfamiliar with programming syntax.
