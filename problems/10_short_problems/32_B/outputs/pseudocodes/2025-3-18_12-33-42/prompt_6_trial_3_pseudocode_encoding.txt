**Pseudocode: Translate Input Representation to Numeric Output**

1. **Start**
2. **Read input string** from standard input, removing any leading or trailing whitespace.
3. **Initialize index** to 0 for tracking position in the string.
4. **Initialize output string** to store the result.
5. **While the index is less than the length of the string**:
    - **If the current character at the index is a dot (.)**:
        - Append '0' to the output string.
        - Move to the next character by incrementing the index by 1.
    - **Else, if the next character (current index + 1) is a dot (.)**:
        - Append '1' to the output string.
        - Move the index forward by 2 to skip the next character.
    - **Else** (if neither condition above is met):
        - Append '2' to the output string.
        - Move to the character after next by incrementing the index by 2.
6. **Print the output string** which contains the converted representation.
7. **End** 

**Explanation of Key Operations:**
- The algorithm reads an encoded string consisting of dots and processes them in sequence.
- It translates single dots (.) to '0', pairs of dots (..) to '1', and any other character (implied as not a dot) also in pairs to '2'.
- The output is built up as characters are processed, resulting in a numeric representation.
