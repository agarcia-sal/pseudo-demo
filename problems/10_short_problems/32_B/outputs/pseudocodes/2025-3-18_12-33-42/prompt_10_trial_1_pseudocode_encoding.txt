Here is the translated pseudocode based on the provided guidelines:

```
START PROGRAM

// Import necessary modules (assumed step in pseudocode)
IMPORT sys

// Read input line from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace
SET inputString TO READ_LINE_FROM_STDIN
TRIM inputString

// Initialize index variable and result string
SET index TO 0
SET resultString TO ''

// Loop through the characters in inputString until the end is reached
WHILE index < LENGTH(inputString) DO
    // Check if the current character is a dot
    IF inputString[index] EQUALS '.' THEN
        APPEND '0' TO resultString
        INCREMENT index BY 1
    // Check if the next character is a dot
    ELSE IF inputString[index + 1] EQUALS '.' THEN
        APPEND '1' TO resultString
        INCREMENT index BY 2
    // If neither condition is met
    ELSE 
        APPEND '2' TO resultString
        INCREMENT index BY 2
    END IF
END WHILE

// Output the result string
PRINT resultString

END PROGRAM
```

### Breakdown of the Translation:
1. **Identify the Main Components:** The pseudocode includes reading input, looping through the string, condition-checking using if-else statements, and finally printing the result.
  
2. **Break Down Complex Elements:** Each if-else branch is clearly articulated, showing how characters are processed and how the result string is built.

3. **State Assumptions Clearly:** Assumes that the input is a string composed of '.' and other characters suitable for the logic applied.

4. **Maintain Clarity and Readability:** Each operation is expressed in clear, descriptive language rather than code specific terms.

5. **Choose Appropriate Verb Tenses:** Present tense is consistently used for actions, keeping the pseudocode active and direct.
