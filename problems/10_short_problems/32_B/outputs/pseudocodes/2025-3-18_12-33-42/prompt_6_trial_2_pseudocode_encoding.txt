**Pseudocode: Convert Morse-like Code to Numeric Representation**

```
1. Start Program

2. Read a line of input and remove any leading or trailing spaces
   INPUT: string inputString

3. Initialize a variable index to 0
   SET index = 0

4. Initialize an empty string to store the output
   SET outputString = ''

5. While index is less than the length of inputString:
   REPEAT
      a. If the character at the current index is a dot ('.'):
         i. Append '0' to outputString
         ii. Increment index by 1
      
      b. Else if the next character (at index + 1) is a dot ('.'):
         i. Append '1' to outputString
         ii. Increment index by 2
      
      c. Else:
         i. Append '2' to outputString
         ii. Increment index by 2
   
6. Print the outputString

7. End Program
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode provides a clear step-by-step outline of the algorithm's logic without getting into programming syntax.
- Each operation is described to ensure understanding, such as reading input, processing characters based on specific conditions, and constructing the output string accordingly.
- Control structures like the `while` loop and `if-else` statements are clearly articulated for easy comprehension.
