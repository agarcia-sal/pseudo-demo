**Purpose Summary**: The code takes an input string that consists of sequences of dots and produces a corresponding output string of numbers based on specific rules related to the patterns of the dots.

**Pseudocode**:

```
Start Program

// Read input from standard input
Read input string and remove any extra whitespace
Initialize index to 0
Initialize empty result string

// Loop through the input string until the end is reached
While index is less than the length of the input string:

    // Check if the current character is a dot
    If the current character is a dot:
        Append '0' to the result string
        Move to the next character (index + 1)
    
    // Check if the next character is a dot
    Else if the next character is a dot:
        Append '1' to the result string
        Move forward two characters (index + 2)
    
    // If the next character is not a dot
    Else:
        Append '2' to the result string
        Move forward two characters (index + 2)

// Output the final result string
Print the result string

End Program
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
1. The program reads a series of dots (`.`) and interprets them into a numerical representation based on their patterns.
2. A single dot translates to '0', and pairs of dots translate into '1' or '2', depending on the specific sequence encountered in the input.
3. By adjusting the index accordingly, the program processes the entire input string.
