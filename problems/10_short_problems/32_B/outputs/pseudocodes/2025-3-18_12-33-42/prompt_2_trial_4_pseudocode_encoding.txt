**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input**: Read a line of input from the standard input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, and assign it to the variable `inputString`.

2. **Initialize**: 
   - Set an index variable `currentIndex` to 0.
   - Create an empty string variable `resultString` to accumulate the output.

3. **Process the Input**: 
   - While the `currentIndex` is less than the length of `inputString`:
     - If the character at the `currentIndex` position of `inputString` is a dot ('.'):
       - Append '0' to `resultString`.
       - Increment `currentIndex` by 1.
     - Else, check the next character at `currentIndex + 1`:
       - If that character is a dot ('.'):
         - Append '1' to `resultString`.
         - Increment `currentIndex` by 2.
       - Otherwise:
         - Append '2' to `resultString`.
         - Increment `currentIndex` by 2.

4. **Output**: Print the final value of `resultString`. 

**Summary of Logic**:
- This code reads a string consisting of dots and other characters.
- It converts each sequence of characters into a specific numerical representation based on its configuration:
  - A single dot converts to '0'.
  - A dot followed by another character converts to '1'.
  - Two characters that are not dots convert to '2'.
- The process repeats until all characters in the input have been processed, yielding a numerical string as the output.
