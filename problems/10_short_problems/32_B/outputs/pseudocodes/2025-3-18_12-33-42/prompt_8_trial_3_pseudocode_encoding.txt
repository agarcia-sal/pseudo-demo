**Objective:** The goal of this code is to read a string of characters from input, interpret the characters based on specific rules, and then produce a string of digits as output.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Read a line of input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace
    INPUT stringFromUser

    // Initialize an index variable to track our position in the string
    SET index TO 0

    // Initialize an empty string to build the result
    SET resultString TO empty string

    // Continue processing until we have checked all characters in the input string
    WHILE index is less than the length of stringFromUser DO

        // Check if the current character is a dot ('.')
        IF character at stringFromUser[index] is '.' THEN
            // Append '0' to the result
            APPEND '0' to resultString
            // Move to the next character
            INCREMENT index by 1

        // If the next character in the string is also a dot
        ELSE IF character at stringFromUser[index + 1] is '.' THEN
            // Append '1' to the result
            APPEND '1' to resultString
            // Move the index forward by two characters
            INCREMENT index by 2

        // If neither of the above conditions are met
        ELSE
            // Append '2' to the result
            APPEND '2' to resultString
            // Move the index forward by two characters
            INCREMENT index by 2

    // Output the final constructed result string
    PRINT resultString

END
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The input string contains characters that represent either single or pairs of dots.
- The output string is constructed based on rules regarding how many dots are detected at a time.
- The code must handle cases where the input string is exhausted to avoid errors. 

This pseudocode encapsulates the logic of the original code while ensuring that each step and component is clearly articulated for ease of understanding.
