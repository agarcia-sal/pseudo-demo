**Purpose:**  
The objective of this code is to read a string of characters representing a sequence of actions, decipher it into a numerical format based on specific rules, and output the resulting numerical string.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input and remove any surrounding whitespace. This input represents a sequence of characters.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter `index` to 0 to track our position in the input string.
   - Create an empty string called `result` to store the output numbers.

3. **Process the Input:**
   - Continue processing while `index` is less than the length of the input string:
     - If the character at the current `index` is a dot:
       - Add '0' to `result`.
       - Move to the next character by increasing `index` by 1.
     - Otherwise, check the next character:
       - If the character at `index + 1` is also a dot:
         - Add '1' to `result`.
         - Move forward by increasing `index` by 2.
       - Otherwise:
         - Add '2' to `result`.
         - Move forward by increasing `index` by 2.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the resulting numerical string `result`.

**Key Notes:**
- The algorithm utilizes a while loop to traverse through the input string.
- The conditions check for specific patterns of characters (dots) to determine the output.
- The final output is a string composed of '0's, '1's, and '2's based on the rules defined.
