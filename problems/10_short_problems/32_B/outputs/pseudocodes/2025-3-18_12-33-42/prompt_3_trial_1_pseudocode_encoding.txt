Here's the pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided Python code:

```
START

// Read input from standard input and remove any leading/trailing whitespace
READ inputString

// Initialize variables
SET index = 0
SET outputString = ''

// Process the input string while we haven't reached the end
WHILE index is less than the length of inputString DO

    // Check current character
    IF current character at index is '.' THEN
        // Add '0' to outputString for a single dot
        APPEND '0' to outputString
        // Move to the next character
        INCREMENT index by 1
        
    ELSE IF next character at index+1 is '.' THEN
        // Add '1' to outputString for two consecutive dots
        APPEND '1' to outputString
        // Move index forward by two characters
        INCREMENT index by 2
    
    ELSE
        // Add '2' to outputString for a dash followed by any character
        APPEND '2' to outputString
        // Move index forward by two characters
        INCREMENT index by 2

END WHILE

// Output the final result
PRINT outputString

END
```

### Explanation:

- The pseudocode begins by describing the process of reading input and initializing variables.
- It includes a while loop to iterate through the input string until the end is reached.
- Inside the loop, conditional checks determine how to interpret the characters based on the specified rules.
- As it processes each character or set of characters, it builds the output string accordingly.
- Finally, it prints the constructed output, summarizing the transformation from input to output.
