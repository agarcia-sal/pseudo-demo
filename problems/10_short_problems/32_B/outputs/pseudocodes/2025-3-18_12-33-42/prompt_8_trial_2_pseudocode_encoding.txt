**Purpose Summary**: The code translates a specific input string representing a series of characters into a corresponding numerical string using defined rules. The characters represent points and dashes that are associated with the digits '0', '1', and '2'.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start Program**

2. **Initialize Input**
   - Read a line of input from the user, and remove any extra spaces from the beginning and end. 
   - Store this processed string in a variable called `inputString`.

3. **Initialize Variables**
   - Set an index variable `index` to 0, which will be used to track our position in `inputString`.
   - Create an empty string called `result` that will hold our final numerical output.

4. **Process Input String Using a Loop**
   - While the `index` is less than the length of `inputString`:
     - **Check Current Character**
       - If the character at the current `index` of `inputString` is a dot ('.'):
         - Append '0' to the `result`.
         - Increment `index` by 1 to move to the next character.
       - Else if the character at the next `index` (i.e., `index + 1`) is also a dot ('.'):
         - Append '1' to the `result`.
         - Increment `index` by 2 to skip both the current and next character.
       - Else:
         - Append '2' to the `result`.
         - Increment `index` by 2 to skip both the current and next character.

5. **Output Result**
   - After processing the entire string, print the `result`.

6. **End Program**

**Comments**:
- The program assumes that the input conforms to a specific pattern where characters can be dots ('.') and potentially other characters.
- The rules for appending '0', '1', or '2' are solely based on the current and next characters in the input string. 

**Example Structure**:
```plaintext
Read user input and store it in inputString
Set index to 0
Set result to empty string
While index is less than length of inputString
   If current character is '.'
      Append '0' to result
      Increment index by 1
   Else if next character is '.'
      Append '1' to result
      Increment index by 2
   Else
      Append '2' to result
      Increment index by 2
Print result
```
This pseudocode provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the logic without using any specific programming language syntax, making it accessible to a wider audience.
