**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the standard input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - Store this input string in a variable named `inputString`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set an index variable `index` to 0.
   - Create an empty string variable `result` to store the output.

3. **Process the Input String:**
   - While `index` is less than the length of `inputString`:
     - If the character at the current index of `inputString` is a period ('.'):
       - Append '0' to `result`.
       - Increment `index` by 1 (move to the next character).
     - Else, if the character at the next index of `inputString` is a period ('.'):
       - Append '1' to `result`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 (skip the next character).
     - Else:
       - Append '2' to `result`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 (skip the next character).

4. **Output Result:**
   - Print the contents of `result`.

**Summary of Logic:**
- The algorithm reads a string of characters composed of periods and possibly other characters.
- It processes the string in a loop, checking characters in pairs (and occasionally single characters), and builds a result based on specific conditions:
  - If it finds a single period, it appends '0' to the output.
  - If it finds a period followed by another character, it appends '1'.
  - If it finds any other character, it appends '2'.
- Finally, it outputs the compiled results as a string.
