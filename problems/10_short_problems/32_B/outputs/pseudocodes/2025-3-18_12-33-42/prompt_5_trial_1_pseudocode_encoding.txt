### Purpose Summary
The code is designed to translate a specific input string representing a sequence of characters into a new string of digits based on predetermined rules.

### Pseudocode Translation

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Read a line of input and remove any extra spaces
    INPUT originalString

    // Initialize an index to track our position in the input string
    SET index TO 0

    // Initialize an empty string to store the resulting translated output
    SET translatedString TO ''

    // While there are still characters to process in the original string
    WHILE index is less than the length of originalString DO

        // If the current character is a dot
        IF character at originalString[index] is '.' THEN
            // Append '0' to the translated output
            CONCATENATE '0' to translatedString
            // Move to the next character
            INCREMENT index by 1

        // Else, if the next character is also a dot
        ELSE IF character at originalString[index + 1] is '.' THEN
            // Append '1' to the translated output
            CONCATENATE '1' to translatedString
            // Move forward by two characters
            INCREMENT index by 2

        // Otherwise (the current character is not a dot and the next one isnâ€™t either)
        ELSE
            // Append '2' to the translated output
            CONCATENATE '2' to translatedString
            // Move forward by two characters
            INCREMENT index by 2

    // Display the final translated output
    OUTPUT translatedString

END PROGRAM
```

### Explanation of Logic

1. **Input Handling:** The program starts by reading an input string, which is meant to be analyzed character by character.
   
2. **Looping Through Characters:** The main operations occur within a loop that continues until all characters in the input string have been processed.

3. **Character Evaluation:** For each character (and sometimes the next character), the program checks:
   - If the character is a dot (.), it appends '0' to the output.
   - If the next character is a dot, it appends '1' while skipping both characters.
   - If neither condition holds, it appends '2' and also skips both characters.

4. **Output Generation:** The resulting string created from the conditions is ultimately printed.

### Final Notes
This pseudocode maintains clarity by focusing on the high-level operations and logic flow without delving deeply into programming syntax or technical terms. It provides a structured outline that could be easily followed by readers unfamiliar with the specific programming language used.
