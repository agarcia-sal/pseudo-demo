**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to transform a specific input string into a numeric string representation based on the characters in the input.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a single line of input and remove any leading or trailing spaces.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set an index variable `currentIndex` to 0.
   - Create an empty string `outputString` to store the resulting numeric representation.

3. **Process the Input String:**
   - While `currentIndex` is less than the length of the input string:
     - If the character at `currentIndex` is a dot (`.`):
       - Append '0' to `outputString`.
       - Increase `currentIndex` by 1 to move to the next character.
     - Otherwise, if the next character (at `currentIndex + 1`) is also a dot (`.`):
       - Append '1' to `outputString`.
       - Increase `currentIndex` by 2 to skip the next character.
     - Otherwise:
       - Append '2' to `outputString`.
       - Increase `currentIndex` by 2 to skip two characters.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Display the final `outputString`.

**Summary of Operations:**
- The code reads a sequence of characters, processes them to determine the appropriate output based on distinct patterns involving dots, and constructs a new string based on these conditions.

**Control Flow Explanation:**
- A while loop iterates through the input string until all characters are processed based on specified patterns, using conditional statements to decide how to append to the output string and how much to increment the index for the next iteration. 

By following this structured approach, we ensure that each step of the process is clear, making it easier to understand the codeâ€™s intent and functionality.
