**Pseudocode for Translating the Given Code:**

```
BEGIN

    // Read the input string from standard input
    INPUT string inputString FROM standard input

    // Initialize a variable to keep track of the current position in the string
    SET currentIndex TO 0
    
    // Initialize an empty string to hold the output result
    SET outputResult TO ''

    // Loop through the entire input string until the end is reached
    WHILE currentIndex is less than the length of inputString DO

        // Check if the current character is a period
        IF inputString[currentIndex] EQUALS '.' THEN
            // Append '0' to the output result for a single period
            APPEND '0' TO outputResult
            // Move to the next character
            INCREMENT currentIndex BY 1
            
        // Check for a pair of periods
        ELSE IF inputString[currentIndex + 1] EQUALS '.' THEN
            // Append '1' to the output result for two periods
            APPEND '1' TO outputResult
            // Move past these two characters
            INCREMENT currentIndex BY 2
            
        // Handle the case for a period followed by a dash (assumed)
        ELSE
            // Append '2' to the output result for a period followed by a dash
            APPEND '2' TO outputResult
            // Move past these two characters
            INCREMENT currentIndex BY 2
            
        ENDIF
        
    ENDWHILE

    // Print the resulting output string
    OUTPUT outputResult

END
```

**Explanation:**
- The pseudocode starts by reading an input string and initializes necessary variables.
- It uses a loop to process characters in the string by checking conditions related to the current and next characters.
- Depending on the character pattern (periods and potentially other symbols), it appends corresponding values ('0', '1', or '2') to the output string.
- Finally, it prints the resulting string after processing all characters.
