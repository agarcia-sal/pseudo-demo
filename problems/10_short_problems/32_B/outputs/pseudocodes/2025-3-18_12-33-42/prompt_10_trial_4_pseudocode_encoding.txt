Hereâ€™s a translation of the provided Python code into clear and concise pseudocode using structured language concepts:

### Pseudocode

```
BEGIN MAIN
    // Assumption: Input is read from standard input as a string of characters.
    
    DECLARE string s
    DECLARE integer i = 0
    DECLARE string ans = empty string

    // Read input and remove any leading/trailing whitespace
    s = READ input from standard input
    s = TRIM whitespace from s

    // Loop through the characters in s
    WHILE i < LENGTH of s DO
        // Check the current character in s
        IF s[i] equals '.' THEN
            ans = ans + '0'              // Append '0' to ans
            i = i + 1                     // Move to the next character
            
        ELSE IF s[i + 1] equals '.' THEN
            ans = ans + '1'              // Append '1' to ans
            i = i + 2                     // Skip the next character
            
        ELSE
            ans = ans + '2'              // Append '2' to ans
            i = i + 2                     // Skip the next character
        END IF
    END WHILE

    // Output the final result
    PRINT ans
END MAIN
```

### Explanation of Components:

1. **Main Components Identified:**
   - Variables: `s`, `i`, `ans`.
   - Loop: `WHILE` loop iterating through the length of the string.
   - Conditionals: `IF`, `ELSE IF`, `ELSE` to determine the action based on current characters.

2. **Complex Elements Broken Down:**
   - Character comparison and actions are distinctly laid out for clarity.

3. **Assumptions Stated:**
   - `s` is assumed to be a string input consisting of characters that are either '.' or another character.
   - The pseudocode assumes basic operations on strings and integers such as concatenation and indexing.

4. **Clarity and Readability Maintained:**
   - Meaningful identifiers: `s` for input string, `ans` for output, `i` for index.
   - Clear logic statements express the intended operations.

5. **Appropriate Verb Tenses Used:**
   - Actions are described in present tense to reflect ongoing operations within the pseudocode. 

This structured approach helps to convey the logic of the code in a way that is accessible and easily understood.
