Here's the pseudocode representing the logic of the provided code in a clear and understandable way:

```
BEGIN

    // Read input string from standard input
    INPUT string s

    // Initialize the index and the result variable
    SET index to 0
    SET result to an empty string

    // Loop until the end of the string
    WHILE index is less than the length of s DO

        // Check the character at the current index
        IF the character at index is '.' THEN
            // Append '0' to the result
            APPEND '0' to result
            // Move to the next character
            INCREMENT index by 1
        ELSE
            // Check the next character
            IF the character at index + 1 is '.' THEN
                // Append '1' to the result
                APPEND '1' to result
                // Move two characters ahead
                INCREMENT index by 2
            ELSE
                // Append '2' to the result
                APPEND '2' to result
                // Move two characters ahead
                INCREMENT index by 2
            END IF
        END IF
        
    END WHILE

    // Print the result string
    OUTPUT result

END
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a line of input which contains a string.
2. **Initialization**: Two variables are initialized: one for the index to traverse the string and one for accumulating the result.
3. **Main Loop**: A loop iterates over the string until the end is reached.
4. **Character Checks**:
   - If the current character is a dot `'.'`, `0` is added to the result.
   - If the next character is also a dot, `1` is added, and it skips two characters.
   - If neither condition is met, `2` is added to the result, again skipping two characters.
5. **Output**: Finally, the accumulated result is printed. 

This pseudocode conveys the algorithm in a structured and comprehensible manner, making the logic clear even for those unfamiliar with the original code syntax.
