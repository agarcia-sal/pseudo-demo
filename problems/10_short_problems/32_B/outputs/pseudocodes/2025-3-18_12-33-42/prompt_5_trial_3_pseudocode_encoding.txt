### Purpose Summary
The primary goal of this code is to interpret a string of characters from input, where specific patterns represent different numerical values, and convert it into a numerical string based on these rules.

### Pseudocode

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Read input from standard input, removing any surrounding whitespace
    SET inputString TO read input from standard input and remove whitespace

    // Initialize position index and result string
    SET currentIndex TO 0
    SET resultString TO an empty string

    // Loop through the input string until the end is reached
    WHILE currentIndex is less than the length of inputString DO
        
        // Check the character at the current index
        IF character at inputString[currentIndex] is '.' THEN
            // If current character is a dot, append '0' to result
            APPEND '0' to resultString
            
            // Move to the next character
            INCREMENT currentIndex by 1
            
        ELSE IF the next character at inputString[currentIndex + 1] is '.' THEN
            // If the next character is a dot, append '1' to result
            APPEND '1' to resultString
            
            // Move the index ahead by two characters
            INCREMENT currentIndex by 2

        ELSE 
            // Append '2' to the result as neither of the above conditions were met
            APPEND '2' to resultString
            
            // Move the index ahead by two characters
            INCREMENT currentIndex by 2
            
        END IF
    END WHILE

    // Output the final result string
    PRINT resultString

END PROGRAM
```

### Explanation of Key Operations

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads a single line of input and strips any extra whitespace.
  
2. **Loop Logic:** It utilizes a while loop that continues until every character in the input string has been processed.

3. **Character Evaluation:**
   - If the current character is a '.', it converts that to '0'.
   - If the next character is also a '.', it converts this pattern to '1' and skips the next character.
   - If neither condition is met, it treats the pattern as '2' and also skips the next character.

4. **Output:** After processing all characters, it prints the final string of numbers derived from these conversions.

### Conclusion
This pseudocode effectively captures the logic of the original code in a format that's more approachable for individuals without a strong programming background while maintaining clarity on how input is transformed into output.
