**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program**
   
2. **Read the input string** from standard input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. Store this input string in a variable named `inputString`.

3. **Initialize a variable named `index`** to `0` to track the current position in `inputString`.

4. **Initialize an empty string named `result`** to build the output.

5. **While the current index is less than the length of the input string:**
   - **If the character at the current index is a period ('.'):**
     - Append '0' to the `result` string.
     - Move to the next character by increasing `index` by `1`.
   
   - **Else, if the character at the position after the current index is a period ('.'):**
     - Append '1' to the `result` string.
     - Move ahead by two characters by increasing `index` by `2`.

   - **Otherwise:**
     - Append '2' to the `result` string.
     - Move ahead by two characters by increasing `index` by `2`.

6. **After finishing the loop, output the `result` string.**

**Input:** A string consisting of characters, including periods that need to be processed based on specific conditions.

**Output:** A string built from '0', '1', and '2', which corresponds to the conditions defined during the traversal of the input string.
