Here is the pseudocode based on the provided Python code, adhering to the guided steps:

```
START

// Read input from standard input (assumed single line of input)
SET inputString TO read a line from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace

// Initialize index and result variable
SET index TO 0
SET result TO an empty string

// Process each character in the input string
WHILE index is less than the length of inputString DO
    // Check if the current character is a period
    IF inputString[index] is equal to '.' THEN
        // Append '0' to the result
        APPEND '0' to result
        // Move the index to the next character
        INCREMENT index by 1
    ELSE
        // Check the next character
        IF index + 1 is less than the length of inputString THEN
            // Check if the next character is a period
            IF inputString[index + 1] is equal to '.' THEN
                // Append '1' to the result
                APPEND '1' to result
                // Move the index forward by 2
                INCREMENT index by 2
            ELSE
                // If neither character is a period
                // Append '2' to the result
                APPEND '2' to result
                // Move the index forward by 2
                INCREMENT index by 2

// Output the final result
PRINT result

END
```

### Assumptions:
- The input string consists only of characters '.' and other unspecified characters.
- The input is read from standard input as a single line.
- The length of the input string is manageable and will fit in memory.
