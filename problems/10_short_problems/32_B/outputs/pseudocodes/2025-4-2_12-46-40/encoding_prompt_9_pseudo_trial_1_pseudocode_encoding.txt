**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to convert a specific string input, which represents a sequence of symbols, into a numerical string based on a defined set of rules.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Take a line of input from the user (this input will be a string of symbols).
   
2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set an index variable to 0, which will be used to traverse the input string.
   - Create an empty string to store the resulting number sequence.

3. **Process Each Symbol:**
   - While the index is less than the length of the input string:
     - Check if the current symbol is a dot ("."):
       - If it is, append "0" to the result string and move to the next symbol (increment the index by 1).
     - If the current symbol is not a dot, look at the next symbol:
       - If the next symbol is also a dot:
         - Append "1" to the result string and skip to the next pair of symbols (increment the index by 2).
       - If the next symbol is not a dot:
         - Append "2" to the result string and again skip to the next pair of symbols (increment the index by 2).

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the resulting string of numbers.

**Final Structure:**
- Input: A string of symbols (dots and potentially others)
- Output: A string of numbers (consisting of '0', '1', and '2') based on specific transformation rules

This pseudocode maintains the logic and flow of the original code while ensuring clarity and understandability for the reader.
