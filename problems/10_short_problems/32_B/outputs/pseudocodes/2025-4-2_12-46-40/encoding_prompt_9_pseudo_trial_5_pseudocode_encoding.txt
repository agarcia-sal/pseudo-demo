**Purpose:**  
This algorithm converts a specific string format into a numerical representation by analyzing pairs and single characters in the input string.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user and remove any surrounding whitespace.
   - Store the input string in a variable named `inputString`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0 to track the current position in the input string.
   - Create an empty string variable named `outputString` to store the resulting numeric representation.

3. **Process the Input String:**
   - While `index` is less than the length of `inputString`:
     - If the character at `inputString[index]` is a dot ('.'):
       - Append the character '0' to `outputString`.
       - Increment `index` by 1 to move to the next character.
     - Else if the character at `inputString[index + 1]` is a dot ('.'):
       - Append the character '1' to `outputString`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 to skip to the character after the next.
     - Otherwise:
       - Append the character '2' to `outputString`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 to skip to the character after the next.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print `outputString` which contains the converted numerical representation.

**Final Notes:**
- The algorithm efficiently processes the input string by determining how to group and convert its characters based on specific conditions (single dots and pairs).
- It ensures that the output reflects the expected numerical format derived from the input string.
