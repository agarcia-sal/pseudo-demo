**Purpose:**  
The goal of this program is to decode a specific sequence of characters from an input string into a new numerical representation based on a set of defined rules.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Input:**
   - Accept a string of characters from the user, which will consist of either dots (.) or hyphens (-).

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set an index counter `i` to 0 to keep track of the current position in the input string.
   - Create an empty string `decodedOutput` to store the result of the decoding process.

3. **Process Input String:**
   - While `i` is less than the length of the input string:
     - If the character at position `i` is a dot ():
       - Append '0' to `decodedOutput`.
       - Move to the next character by incrementing `i` by 1.
     - Else if the next character (at position `i + 1`) is also a dot:
       - Append '1' to `decodedOutput`.
       - Skip to the character after next by increasing `i` by 2.
     - Otherwise, if a hyphen is in the current position:
       - Append '2' to `decodedOutput`.
       - Again, skip to the character after next by increasing `i` by 2.

4. **Output Result:**
   - Print the final `decodedOutput`, which is the decoded representation of the input string.

**Comments:**
- This program uses a loop to traverse the input string character by character. 
- The conditions check whether to append '0', '1', or '2' based on the combination of current and next characters to form the encoded output.

**Example Structure:**
```
START
    GET input string from user
    SET i to 0
    SET decodedOutput to empty string

    WHILE i is less than length of input string DO
        IF character at index i is '.' THEN
            APPEND '0' to decodedOutput
            INCREMENT i by 1
        ELSE IF character at index i + 1 is '.' THEN
            APPEND '1' to decodedOutput
            INCREMENT i by 2
        ELSE
            APPEND '2' to decodedOutput
            INCREMENT i by 2
        END IF
    END WHILE

    PRINT decodedOutput
END
``` 

This pseudocode should provide a clear and logical understanding of how the program operates for readers unfamiliar with the original code, focusing on the flow of operations and the structure of the encoding logic.
