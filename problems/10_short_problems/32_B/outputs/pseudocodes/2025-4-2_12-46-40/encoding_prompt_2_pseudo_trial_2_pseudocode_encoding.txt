**Pseudocode Translation**

1. **Input**: Read a line of input that contains a string of characters representing some encoded information.

2. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - Set an index variable (`currentIndex`) to 0 to track our position in the input string.
   - Create an empty string variable (`outputString`) to store the results.

3. **Processing Loop**: 
   - While the current index is less than the length of the input string:
     - Check the character at the current index:
       - If the character is a dot ("."):
         - Append '0' to the output string.
         - Move to the next character by incrementing the current index by 1.
       - If the character after the current index (next character) is also a dot ("."):
         - Append '1' to the output string.
         - Skip the next character by incrementing the current index by 2.
       - Otherwise (if the next character is not a dot):
         - Append '2' to the output string.
         - Also skip the next character by incrementing the current index by 2.

4. **Output**: After the loop finishes, display the resulting output string.
