**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input:** Read a single line of input which is a string representing a sequence of dots and other characters. Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string.

2. **Initialization:** 
   - Set an index variable named "currentIndex" to 0.
   - Initialize an empty string named "outputString" to store the final result.

3. **Process Loop:**
   - While the "currentIndex" is less than the length of the input string:
     - Check if the character at the current index is a dot ('.'):
       - If it is:
         - Append '0' to "outputString".
         - Move to the next character by increasing "currentIndex" by 1.
     - Otherwise, check the character at the next index (currentIndex + 1):
       - If the next character is a dot ('.'):
         - Append '1' to "outputString".
         - Move to the next two characters by increasing "currentIndex" by 2.
       - If the next character is not a dot:
         - Append '2' to "outputString".
         - Move to the next two characters by increasing "currentIndex" by 2.

4. **Output:** Print the contents of "outputString", which represents the transformation of the input string based on the specified rules.
