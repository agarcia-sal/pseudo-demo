Below is the pseudocode that captures the logic of the original code while emphasizing clarity and readability:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Read input string from standard input
    READ inputString FROM standard input

    // Initialize index and output variable
    SET index TO 0
    SET outputString TO an empty string

    // Loop through the input string until the end
    WHILE index is less than length of inputString DO
        
        // Check if the current character is '.'
        IF inputString[index] is equal to '.' THEN
            // Append '0' to the output
            APPEND '0' to outputString
            // Move to the next character
            INCREMENT index by 1
        
        // Check for the pattern ".."
        ELSE IF the next character (inputString[index + 1]) is equal to '.' THEN
            // Append '1' to the output
            APPEND '1' to outputString
            // Move the index forward by two characters
            INCREMENT index by 2

        // Otherwise, the pattern is '.-' or another character
        ELSE 
            // Append '2' to the output
            APPEND '2' to outputString
            // Move the index forward by two characters
            INCREMENT index by 2

    END WHILE

    // Output the final result
    PRINT outputString

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading the input string, similar to how the original code uses `stdin.readline()`.
2. **Initialization**: Two variables are set up: one to track the current position in the input string (`index`), and another to build the result (`outputString`).
3. **Looping Through Input**: A loop continues as long as the index does not exceed the length of the input string.
4. **Decision Making**: The pseudocode uses simple conditional statements to determine the contents of the input string:
   - **Single Character Condition**: If the current character is a dot (`.`), it appends '0' to the output and moves to the next character.
   - **Double Dot Condition**: If the next character is also a dot (`..`), it appends '1' and skips the next character by moving the index by two.
   - **Default Condition**: For any other character arrangement, it appends '2' and also moves forward by two characters.
5. **Final Output**: After processing the entire string, the result is printed. 

This structured and high-level overview of the algorithm's functionality makes it easier for anyone unfamiliar with the original code to grasp the main operations and logic behind it.
