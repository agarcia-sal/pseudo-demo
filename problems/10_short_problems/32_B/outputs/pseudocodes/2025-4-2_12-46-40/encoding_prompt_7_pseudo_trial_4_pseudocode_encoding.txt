Here is the high-level pseudocode based on the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION translateDotsAndDashes(inputString)
    INITIALIZE index to 0
    INITIALIZE answer string to an empty string

    WHILE index is less than the length of inputString DO
        IF character at index in inputString is a dot ('.') THEN
            Append '0' to answer
            Increment index by 1
        ELSE IF character at index plus 1 in inputString is a dot ('.') THEN
            Append '1' to answer
            Increment index by 2
        ELSE
            Append '2' to answer
            Increment index by 2
        END IF
    END WHILE

    RETURN answer
END FUNCTION

// Read input from standard input
INITIALIZE inputString as the first line of input
SET result to translateDotsAndDashes(inputString)
PRINT result
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `translateDotsAndDashes` translates a string of characters (dots and dashes) into a numerical string based on certain rules.
  
2. **Variable Names**:
   - `inputString`: The input string containing dots and dashes.
   - `index`: Used to iterate through the input string.
   - `answer`: Stores the resulting translated string.

3. **Control Structures**:
   - A `WHILE` loop processes the string until all characters are evaluated.
   - Conditional statements (`IF`, `ELSE IF`, `ELSE`) are used to apply the translation rules based on the current and next characters.

4. **Input & Output**: 
   - The input is read from standard input.
   - The output is the translated string, printed to the console.

5. **Summary of Translation Rules**:
   - A single dot represents '0'.
   - A dot followed by a dot represents '1' (indicating two input characters).
   - Any other combination (e.g., a dash) represents '2' (also indicating two input characters).

This pseudocode provides a clear and structured representation of the original code's logic without getting into low-level implementation details.
