Hereâ€™s the pseudocode translation based on your instructions:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Import necessary functions (assumed action)
    // Assume input is provided through standard input stream

    READ input string s FROM standard input      // Read input from user
    REMOVE whitespace from both ends of s        // Strip whitespace from s

    SET index i TO 0                              // Initialize index counter i to 0
    SET answer string ans TO empty                // Initialize the answer string ans to empty

    WHILE i is less than the length of s DO      // Loop until i reaches the length of s
        IF s[i] is equal to '.' THEN             // Check if the current character is a dot
            APPEND '0' to ans                     // Append '0' to the answer string ans
            INCREMENT i by 1                      // Move to the next character (i + 1)
        ELSE IF s[i+1] is equal to '.' THEN      // Check if the next character is also a dot
            APPEND '1' to ans                     // Append '1' to the answer string ans
            INCREMENT i by 2                      // Move to the character after next (i + 2)
        ELSE                                      // If neither of the above conditions are true
            APPEND '2' to ans                     // Append '2' to the answer string ans
            INCREMENT i by 2                      // Move to the character after next (i + 2)
        END IF
    END WHILE

    PRINT ans                                     // Output the final answer string

END
```

### Assumptions:
- The input string `s` consists only of '.' characters and other unspecified characters.
- The length of the string is valid and will not cause index errors. 
- The program correctly reads from standard input and can display output.
