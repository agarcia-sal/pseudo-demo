**Pseudocode:**

1. **Begin Program**
   
2. **Read Input:**
   - Accept a line of input from the user and remove any leading or trailing spaces. Store this input in a variable called `inputString`.

3. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of our current position in `inputString`.
   - Create an empty string `outputString` to build the resulting output.

4. **Process Input:**
   - While `index` is less than the length of `inputString`:
     - If the character at the current position (`inputString[index]`) is a period ('.'):
       - Append '0' to `outputString`.
       - Increment `index` by 1 to move to the next character.
     - Else, if the next character (`inputString[index + 1]`) is a period ('.'):
       - Append '1' to `outputString`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 to skip both characters (the current and the next one).
     - Otherwise:
       - Append '2' to `outputString`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 to skip both characters (the current and the next one).

5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the value of `outputString`.

6. **End Program**
