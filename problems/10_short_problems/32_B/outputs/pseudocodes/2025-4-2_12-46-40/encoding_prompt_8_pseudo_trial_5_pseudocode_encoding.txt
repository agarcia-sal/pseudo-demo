**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to translate a specific encoded string received from input into a numeric representation according to defined rules.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Import Required Libraries**
   - Import system libraries necessary to read standard input.

2. **Read Input**
   - Read a single line of input, which is a string of characters, and remove any extra spaces.

3. **Initialize Variables**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0 to track our current position within the string.
   - Create an empty string named `result` to store the translated output.

4. **Process the Input String**
   - While the `index` is less than the length of the input string:
     - **If the current character (at `index`) is a dot ('.'):**
       - Append '0' to the `result`.
       - Move to the next character by increasing `index` by 1.
     - **Else, if the next character (at `index + 1`) is also a dot ('.'):**
       - Append '1' to the `result`.
       - Move forward by increasing `index` by 2 (to skip both characters).
     - **Otherwise:**
       - Append '2' to the `result`.
       - Move forward by increasing `index` by 2 (to skip both characters).

5. **Output the Result**
   - Print the `result`, which now contains the numeric representation as a string.

### Detailed Breakdown of Key Steps:

- **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input and cleans it to ensure it is clear for processing.
  
- **Indexing Logic:**
   - The program uses an index to navigate through the string, allowing for skipping characters when necessary depending on the rules defined.

- **Character Translation:**
   - The program checks the current and next characters to decide how to translate them into numbers ('0', '1', or '2') and accumulates these translations into a final result.

### Example of Flow:
- Given input could be `".##..#.."`:
  - According to rules:
    - First dot translates to '0'.
    - Next two dots together translate to '1'.
    - Any single character (not specified here) would effectively translate to '2'.

### Comments:
- Each decision point is clearly defined, ensuring that any reader can follow the logic without needing specific programming syntax knowledge. 

This structure provides a clear understanding of the logic without needing prior experience with programming language details.
