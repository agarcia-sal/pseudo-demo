Here is the pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided Python code:

```
BEGIN

    // Read input string from standard input
    INPUT string s

    // Initialize index and result string
    SET index = 0
    SET result = ''

    // Loop until all characters in the string have been processed
    WHILE index < LENGTH(s) DO
        
        IF character at index s[index] is '.' THEN
            // Append '0' to the result for a single dot
            APPEND '0' to result
            INCREMENT index by 1
            
        ELSE IF character at index s[index + 1] is '.' THEN
            // Append '1' to the result for a dot followed by a dot
            APPEND '1' to result
            INCREMENT index by 2
            
        ELSE 
            // Append '2' for any other scenario (dot followed by something else)
            APPEND '2' to result
            INCREMENT index by 2

    END WHILE

    // Output the result string
    OUTPUT result

END
```

### Comments:
- The pseudocode clearly describes the input process, the looping structure, and the decision-making criteria based on the current character(s) processed from the input string.
- Each operational step is articulated in a straightforward manner while promoting readability and understanding of the logic within the code.
