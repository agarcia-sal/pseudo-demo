**Pseudocode:**

**Input:** 
A string representing a sequence of characters, read from standard input.

**Output:** 
A string of digits generated based on specific conditions derived from the input string.

1. Read a line of input and remove any leading/trailing whitespace. Assign it to the variable `inputString`.

2. Initialize a variable `index` to 0. This will be used to track our position within `inputString`.

3. Initialize an empty string `result` that will hold the final output.

4. While `index` is less than the length of `inputString`:
   - If the current character in `inputString` (at position `index`) is a dot ('.'):
     - Append the character '0' to `result`.
     - Move to the next character by increasing `index` by 1.
     
   - Otherwise, check the character immediately following the current character (at position `index + 1`):
     - If this following character is also a dot ('.'):
       - Append the character '1' to `result`.
       - Move forward by two characters by increasing `index` by 2.
       
     - If the following character is not a dot:
       - Append the character '2' to `result`.
       - Move forward by two characters by increasing `index` by 2.

5. After processing all characters, output or print the final `result`. 

This logic interprets the sequence of dots and generates a corresponding string of digits (0s, 1s, and 2s) based on defined patterns in the original input string.
