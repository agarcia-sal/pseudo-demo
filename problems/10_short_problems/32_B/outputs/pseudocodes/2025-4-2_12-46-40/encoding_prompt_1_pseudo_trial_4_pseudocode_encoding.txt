**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Read a line of input and remove any extra spaces from the beginning and end
    INPUT string s FROM standard input
    REMOVE whitespace FROM the beginning and end of s

    // Initialize an index to traverse the string and a variable to store the result
    SET index to 0
    SET result to an empty string

    // Loop through the string until the end is reached
    WHILE index is less than the length of s DO
        
        // Check if the current character is a period (.)
        IF character at index of s is '.' THEN
            // If it's a period, append '0' to the result
            APPEND '0' to result
            // Move to the next character
            INCREMENT index by 1
        
        // Otherwise, check the next character
        ELSE
            // Check if the next character is also a period (.)
            IF character at index + 1 of s is '.' THEN
                // If the next character is a period, append '1' to the result
                APPEND '1' to result
                // Move the index forward by 2 characters
                INCREMENT index by 2
            
            // Otherwise, it means we have a different character
            ELSE
                // Append '2' to the result
                APPEND '2' to result
                // Move the index forward by 2 characters
                INCREMENT index by 2
            END IF
        END IF

    END WHILE

    // Output the final result
    PRINT result

END
```

**Explanation:**
- This pseudocode describes a process for converting a specific input string into a numerical representation based on certain characters.
- The input is expected to be a string consisting of periods (.) and potentially other characters.
- As the string is traversed, the program checks for single periods or pairs of characters to determine what to append to the result string.
- The final output is a string of numbers based on the given rules.
