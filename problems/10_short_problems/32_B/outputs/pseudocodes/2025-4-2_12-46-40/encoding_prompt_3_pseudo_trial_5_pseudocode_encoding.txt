### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by indicating that it will read a string from standard input, ensuring any leading or trailing whitespace is removed.
2. **Variable Initialization:** It initializes two variables: an index to track the position within the string and a result string to store the transformed output.
3. **Looping through the String:** A loop is used to process each character, checking conditions to determine what to append to the result string based on the current character and the next one.
4. **Conditional Logic:** Conditional checks determine whether to append '0', '1', or '2' based on the input string's structure.
5. **Final Output:** Once the loop completes, the program outputs the constructed result.

This structured outline allows someone unfamiliar with programming syntax to understand the flow and logic of the original code by using clear variable names, descriptions of control structures, and a focus on the intent of the code.
