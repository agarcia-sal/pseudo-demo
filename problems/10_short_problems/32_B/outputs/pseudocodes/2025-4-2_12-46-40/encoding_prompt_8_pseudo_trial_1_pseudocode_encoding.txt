**Purpose Summary**: The primary aim of this code is to translate a specific input sequence of characters into a numeric string based on defined rules regarding the presence of dots and their arrangements.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Read Input**:
   - Obtain a line of input, which is a string of characters, and remove any extra spaces around it.
   - Store this input string as `inputString`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set a counter variable `index` to 0. This will track the current position within the input string.
   - Create an empty string `outputString` to accumulate the result.

3. **Process Input Until End**:
   - While `index` is less than the length of `inputString`:
     - **If the current character is a dot (.)**:
       - Append '0' to `outputString`.
       - Increment `index` by 1 to move to the next character.
     - **Else If the next character is a dot (.)**:
       - Append '1' to `outputString`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 to skip to the character after the next.
     - **Else** (when no dots are found in the above conditions):
       - Append '2' to `outputString`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 to skip to the character after the next.

4. **Output Result**:
   - Print the final `outputString`, which contains the translated numeric representation from the input sequence.

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The dots in the input are specifically used to determine whether to append '0', '1', or '2' to the output based on their positions.
- The use of the `index` variable helps in navigating through the string without needing additional loops or checks, maintaining efficiency in processing.

This pseudocode is structured to provide clarity and logical flow, making it accessible for anyone wanting to understand the underlying functionality of the original code.
