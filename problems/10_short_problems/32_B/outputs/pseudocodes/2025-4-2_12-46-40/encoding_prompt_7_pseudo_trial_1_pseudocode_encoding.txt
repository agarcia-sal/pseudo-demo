Here's the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION decodeInput()
    // Read input data from the standard input and strip any extra whitespace
    READ inputString FROM standard input
    INITIALIZE index AS 0
    INITIALIZE resultString AS empty string

    // Process the input string until the end is reached
    WHILE index is less than the length of inputString DO
        IF character at index position in inputString is '.' THEN
            // If the current character is a '.', append '0' to result
            APPEND '0' to resultString
            INCREMENT index by 1
        ELSE IF character at (index + 1) position in inputString is '.' THEN
            // If the next character is also '.', append '1' to result
            APPEND '1' to resultString
            INCREMENT index by 2
        ELSE
            // Otherwise, append '2' to result
            APPEND '2' to resultString
            INCREMENT index by 2
        END IF
    END WHILE

    // Output the resulting string
    PRINT resultString
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:
1. **Purpose:** The function reads a string of characters and decodes it based on specific patterns of characters (`'.'` and others) into a numeric form.

2. **Input and Output:** 
   - **Input:** A string read from the standard input which consists of '.' characters and others (implied in the code).
   - **Output:** A string of numbers (`'0'`, `'1'`, `'2'`) is printed based on the decoding logic.

3. **Control Structures:** 
   - A `WHILE` loop processes the input string until all characters are considered.
   - Conditional statements (`IF`, `ELSE IF`, `ELSE`) are used to determine which number to append to the result based on the characters encountered.

4. **Variable Names:** Descriptive names (`inputString`, `resultString`, and `index`) are used to clarify their roles in the code.

This pseudocode summarizes the operations without focusing on specific programming constructs, ensuring it is easy to understand for a diverse audience.
