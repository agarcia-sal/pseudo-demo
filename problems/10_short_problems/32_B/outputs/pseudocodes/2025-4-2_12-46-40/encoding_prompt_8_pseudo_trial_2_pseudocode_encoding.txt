**Purpose:**
The code reads a string representing a sequence of symbols and translates it into a numeric representation based on specific rules.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Read Input:**
   - Get a string of symbols from user input, removing any extra spaces around it.

3. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter `index` to 0 to track the current position in the string.
   - Create an empty string `result` to store the translated numbers.

4. **Process the String:**
   - **While the counter `index` is less than the length of the string:**
     - **If the character at the current index is a dot ('.'):**
       - Append '0' to `result`.
       - Increment `index` by 1 (move to the next character).
     - **Else if the character at the current index plus one is a dot ('.'):**
       - Append '1' to `result`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 (move past the two symbols).
     - **Else:**
       - Append '2' to `result`.
       - Increment `index` by 2 (move past the two symbols).
   
5. **Output Result:**
   - Display the translated string `result`.

6. **End**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The code translates specific symbols ('.' and combinations of symbols) into numbers based on given rules. The handling of indices ensures that character pairs are processed correctly, depending on whether the first character is a dot and whether the next one also is. If at least one dot is found, it adds corresponding numbers to the result string. If no dots are present, it defaults to adding a '2'. 
- The result is a string of numbers that corresponds to the input sequence based on the defined rules.
