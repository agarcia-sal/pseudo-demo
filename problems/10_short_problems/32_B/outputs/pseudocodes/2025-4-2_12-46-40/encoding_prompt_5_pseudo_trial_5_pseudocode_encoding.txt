**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to decode a string input composed of certain symbols into a corresponding numerical representation based on specific rules.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a single line of input and remove any surrounding spaces. Store this input in a variable called `inputString`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a variable `index` and set it to 0. This will help to track the current position in the input string.
   - Create an empty string `outputString` to store the decoded result.

3. **Process Input String:**
   - While `index` is less than the length of `inputString`:
     - If the character at `inputString` at the current `index` is a dot ('.'):
       - Append '0' to `outputString`.
       - Increase `index` by 1 (move to the next character).
     - Else if the character immediately following `inputString` at `index` is a dot ('.'):
       - Append '1' to `outputString`.
       - Increase `index` by 2 (move past this pair of characters).
     - Else:
       - Append '2' to `outputString`.
       - Increase `index` by 2 (again, move past this pair of characters).

4. **Output Result:**
   - Print the contents of `outputString`.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The input string consists of dots and potentially other symbols.
- This logic implies that a sequence of two characters can either represent a '1' or a '2', while a single dot maps to '0'.
- The process loops through the string, checking combinations of characters based on their positions.

**Example Structure:**
```
START
    SET inputString = READ line from user
    SET index = 0
    SET outputString = ""

    WHILE index < length of inputString DO
        IF character at inputString[index] is '.' THEN
            APPEND '0' to outputString
            INCREMENT index by 1
        ELSE IF character at inputString[index + 1] is '.' THEN
            APPEND '1' to outputString
            INCREMENT index by 2
        ELSE
            APPEND '2' to outputString
            INCREMENT index by 2
        END IF
    END WHILE

    PRINT outputString
END
```

This pseudocode clearly articulates the logic and functionality of the original code in a simplified and accessible manner.
