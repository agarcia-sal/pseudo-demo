Hereâ€™s the translated pseudocode following the guided steps:

### Pseudocode

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Read input and initialize variables
    SET inputString AS READ_LINE_FROM_STDIN_AND_REMOVE_TRAILING_SPACES
    SET index AS 0
    SET answer AS AN_EMPTY_STRING

    // Step 2: Process each character in the input string
    WHILE index IS LESS THAN LENGTH OF inputString DO
        IF character AT index OF inputString IS EQUAL TO '.' THEN
            APPEND '0' TO answer
            INCREMENT index BY 1
        ELSE IF character AT (index + 1) OF inputString IS EQUAL TO '.' THEN
            APPEND '1' TO answer
            INCREMENT index BY 2
        ELSE
            APPEND '2' TO answer
            INCREMENT index BY 2
        END IF
    END WHILE

    // Step 3: Output the result
    PRINT answer
END
```

### Assumptions
- The input is a string of characters that may include '.' and other characters.
- The length of `inputString` is non-negative.
- The variable `answer` will hold the resulting transformation of the input and is initialized as an empty string.
- The program expects sufficient input to avoid indexing errors (e.g., the conditionals avoid checking characters out of bounds).

### Key Components Explained
- **Initializations:** The program starts by reading a line of input which is stripped of any leading or trailing spaces.
- **Loop:** The main processing is done in a loop that continues until all characters have been examined.
- **Conditionals:** Logic checks the current character and potentially the next character to determine how to append to the answer string.
- **Output:** Finally, the constructed answer string is printed.

This pseudocode maintains clarity and follows structured language concepts, making it easy to understand the intended behavior of the original code.
