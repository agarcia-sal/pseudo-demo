Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided Python code, structured according to the guidelines:

```
FUNCTION ConvertInputToBinaryString()
    INITIALIZE inputString as a string from standard input
    INITIALIZE index as 0
    INITIALIZE resultString as an empty string

    WHILE index is less than the length of inputString DO
        IF the character at inputString[index] is '.' THEN
            Append '0' to resultString
            Increment index by 1
        ELSE IF the character at inputString[index + 1] is '.' THEN
            Append '1' to resultString
            Increment index by 2
        ELSE
            Append '2' to resultString
            Increment index by 2
        END IF
    END WHILE

    PRINT resultString
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Purpose:** The function `ConvertInputToBinaryString` reads a string input consisting of periods and converts it into a binary-like string based on the defined rules involving '.' characters.
   
2. **Input Description:** It takes a string composed entirely of '.' characters as input from the user.

3. **Control Structures:**
   - A while loop iterates through the string until all characters are processed.
   - Conditional checks decide how to append to the result string based on the current character and the next character.

4. **Output Description:** The function outputs a string composed of '0', '1', and '2', which represent encoded values based on the patterns of '.' in the input string.

5. **Clarity and Meaningfulness:** Variables are named descriptively to indicate their roles, such as `inputString`, `index`, and `resultString`, making it easy to understand the flow.

This pseudocode provides a clear and structured explanation of the original code's logic while adhering to high-level abstraction principles.
