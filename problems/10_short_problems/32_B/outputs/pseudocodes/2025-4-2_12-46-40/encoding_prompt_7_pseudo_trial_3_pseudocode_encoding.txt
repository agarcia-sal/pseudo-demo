### Context and Explanation:
- **Input:** The function reads a single line of input, which is a string potentially consisting of dots ('.') and other characters.
- **Output:** The output is a string of numbers (composed of '0', '1', '2') based on the pattern of dots in the input string.
- **Logic Flow:**
  - The algorithm processes the input string character by character, checking for patterns of dots:
    - If it encounters a single dot, it appends '0' to the result.
    - If it encounters two consecutive dots, it appends '1'.
    - If the current character is not a dot and the one after it is not a dot, it appends '2'.
- **Control Structures:** The pseudocode clearly illustrates the use of loops (`WHILE`) and conditionals (`IF`, `ELSE IF`, `ELSE`) to navigate and evaluate the input string.
