Here is the pseudocode translated from the provided code, following the guided steps:

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

// Define input assumptions
ASSUME input 's' is a string read from standard input
INITIALIZE 'i' as 0
INITIALIZE 'ans' as an empty string

// Loop through each character of the string 's'
WHILE i is less than the length of 's' DO
    // Check for a single dot
    IF s[i] is equal to '.' THEN
        APPEND '0' to 'ans'
        INCREMENT i by 1
    ELSE
        // Check next character for a dot
        IF s[i + 1] is equal to '.' THEN
            APPEND '1' to 'ans'
            INCREMENT i by 2
        ELSE
            APPEND '2' to 'ans'
            INCREMENT i by 2
        END IF
    END IF
END WHILE

// Output the final result
PRINT ans

END PROGRAM
```

### Explanation of Main Components:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string from standard input.
2. **Variables**: 
   - `s`: the input string.
   - `i`: an index variable initialized to 0.
   - `ans`: a string that accumulates the output.
3. **Loop**: The `WHILE` loop iterates through the input string based on the current value of `i`.
4. **Conditionals**: 
   - A primary check for a single dot.
   - A nested check for a dot at the next index.
5. **Output**: Finally, the result stored in `ans` is printed.
