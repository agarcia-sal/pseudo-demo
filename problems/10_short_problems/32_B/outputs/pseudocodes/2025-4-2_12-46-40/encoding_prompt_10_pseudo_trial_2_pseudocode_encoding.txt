Here is the pseudocode translation of the provided Python code following the guided steps:

```pseudocode
BEGIN

  // Assumption: Input is a string consisting of characters '.' and other characters. 
  // 's' is a string with a maximum length defined by standard input.

  DECLARE s AS STRING
  DECLARE i AS INTEGER
  DECLARE ans AS STRING

  // Read a line of input and remove any surrounding whitespace
  s = READ_INPUT_LINE()
  s = REMOVE_WHITESPACE(s)

  // Initialize index and answer variable
  SET i = 0
  SET ans = ''

  // Loop through characters in the string until the end is reached
  WHILE i < LENGTH(s) DO

    // Check the current character for encoding
    IF s[i] EQUALS '.' THEN
      // If it's a single dot, append '0' to the answer
      ans = ans + '0'
      INCREMENT i BY 1
    ELSE IF s[i + 1] EQUALS '.' THEN
      // If next character is a dot, append '1' to the answer
      ans = ans + '1'
      INCREMENT i BY 2
    ELSE
      // In all other cases, append '2' to the answer
      ans = ans + '2'
      INCREMENT i BY 2
    END IF

  END WHILE

  // Output the final result
  PRINT(ans)

END
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Main Components Identified:**
   - **Input Handling**: Reading from standard input.
   - **Loop Structure**: A `WHILE` loop for iterating through characters in the string.
   - **Conditional Checks**: `IF` statements to check the current or next characters.
   - **String Operations**: Appending to the answer string.

2. **Complex Elements**:
   - Encapsulated reading input and whitespace handling in clear step descriptions.
   - Each section of character processing is broken down into distinct actions with clear outcomes.

3. **Assumptions Stated**:
   - The input string will contain specific characters.
   - Identified the end of the string using the length property.

4. **Clarity and Readability**:
   - Identifiers like `s`, `i`, and `ans` are used meaningfully.
   - Each action and condition is clearly articulated.

5. **Present Tense Used**:
   - All actions are stated in the present tense to signify ongoing processes.
