**Summary of Purpose**: 
The goal of this code is to transform a given string that potentially contains the words "dot" and "at" into a valid email format. It replaces "dot" with a period (.) and "at" with an at symbol (@). Additionally, it handles special cases where the string starts or ends with these symbols.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Read Input**: 
   - Get a line of text input from the user and remove any extra spaces around it.

3. **Replace Words**:
   - Change all occurrences of the word "dot" to a period (.)
   - Change all occurrences of the word "at" to an at symbol (@)

4. **Check Beginning Character**:
   - If the modified string starts with a period (.)
     - Prepend "dot" to the string (to indicate the beginning)

5. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set a counter (countOccurrences) to 0
   - Create an empty list (transformedCharacters) to hold individual characters of the final email
   - Set the length to 0 (though this variable seems unused)

6. **Check First Character for "at"**:
   - If the modified string starts with an at symbol (@)
     - Prepend "at" to the string (to indicate the beginning)

7. **Process Each Character**:
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is an at symbol (@):
       - If countOccurrences is greater than 0 (indicating we have seen an "at" before):
         - Append the word "at" to transformedCharacters list
         - Reset countOccurrences to 1
       - Otherwise (this is the first occurrence of "at"):
         - Append the at symbol (@) to transformedCharacters list
         - Set countOccurrences to 1
     - If the character is not an at symbol (@):
       - Append the character to transformedCharacters list

8. **Combine Characters**:
   - Join all characters in the transformedCharacters list into a single string (finalEmail)

9. **Check Ending Character**:
   - If the last character of finalEmail is a period (.):
     - Replace the last character with the word "dot"

10. **Output Result**:
    - Print the final transformed email string

11. **End Program**

**Comments**: 
- This pseudocode clarifies the operations done on the input string, emphasizing how it transitions into a properly formatted email-like string by substituting specific words and handling special scenarios.
