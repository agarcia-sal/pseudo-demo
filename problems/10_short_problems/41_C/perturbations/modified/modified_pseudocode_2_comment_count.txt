**Pseudocode**:

1. **Read Input**:  
   Read a line of text from standard input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. 
   Replace the word "dot" in the string with the character "."  
   Replace the word "at" in the string with the character "@"  

3. 
   If the first character of the string is ".",  
      Prepend "dot" to the string, keeping the rest of the string.  

4. 
   Set a counter for "@" occurrences to zero.  
   Create an empty list for storing characters of the modified string.  
   Initialize a variable to track character position 

5. 
   If the first character of the string is "@",  
      Prepend "at" to the string, keeping the rest of the string.  

6. 
   For each character in the modified string:  
      - If the character is "@":
         - If there has already been an "@" encountered before:
            - Append "at" to the list of characters.  
            - Set the occurrence counter to 1 
         - Otherwise:
            - Append "@" to the list of characters.  
            - Set the occurrence counter to 1.

      - If the character is not "@":
         - Append the character to the list of characters.

7. 
   Join all characters in the list into a single string.

8. 
   If the last character of the combined string is a ".",  
      Remove the last character and append "dot" instead.

9. **Output Result**:  
   Print the final modified string.
