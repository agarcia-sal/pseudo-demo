**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start Program**

2. **Read Input**: 
   - Get a string of characters from the user and remove any leading/trailing whitespace.

3. 
   - Replace every occurrence of the word "dot" with "." 
   - Replace every occurrence of the word "at" with "@" (at symbol).

4. 
   - If the first character of the string is ".", then:
     - Prepend "dot" to the string, removing the first character 

5. 
   - Create a counter variable to track occurrences of "@" (set to zero).
   - Create an empty list to store the processed characters.
   - Set the length variable to zero.

6. 
   - If the first character of the modified string is "@", then:
     - Prepend "at" to the string, removing the first character 

7. 
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@", then:
       - If the counter is greater than zero:
         - Append "at" to the list.
         - Set the counter to one.
       - Otherwise:
         - Append "@" to the list.
         - Set the counter to one.
     - If the character is not "@", then:
       - Append the character to the list.

8. 
   - Combine all elements in the list into a single string.

9. 
   - If the last character of the resulting string is ".", then:
     - Replace the "." at the end of the string with "dot".

10. **Output the Result**:
    - Print the final formatted string.

11. **End Program**
