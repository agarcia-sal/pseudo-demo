Here's a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION processInputEmail()
    INITIALIZE inputString FROM standard input
    REMOVE unnecessary whitespace from inputString
    REPLACE occurrences of 'dot' with '.' in inputString
    REPLACE occurrences of 'at' with '@' in inputString
    
    IF the first character of inputString is '.' THEN
        PREPEND 'dot' to inputString (except the first character)
    END IF

    INITIALIZE counter AS 0
    INITIALIZE outputCharacters AS empty list
    INITIALIZE length AS 0

    IF the first character of inputString is '@' THEN
        PREPEND 'at' to inputString (except the first character)
    END IF

    FOR each character in inputString DO
        IF character is '@' THEN
            IF counter is greater than 0 THEN
                APPEND 'at' to outputCharacters
                SET counter TO 1 
            ELSE
                APPEND '@' to outputCharacters
                SET counter TO 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            APPEND character to outputCharacters
        END IF
    END FOR

    COMBINE all characters in outputCharacters into a single string named finalString

    IF the last character of finalString is '.' THEN
        REMOVE last character from finalString
        APPEND 'dot' to finalString
    END IF

    OUTPUT finalString
END FUNCTION
```

### Clarifications:
- **Purpose:** The code processes a string (an email-like input) for specific replacements and formats, particularly around 'dot' and 'at', and ensures the correct representation of these symbols.
- **Input:** The function reads a single line of input from the standard input.
- **Output:** The function prints the formatted string following the specified rules, addressing specific replacements and character handling. 

This pseudocode maintains the flow and logic of the original code while using clear language and structured formatting to enhance understanding.
