**Pseudocode for the Translation of the Given Code:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Read a single line of input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **String Replacement:**
   - Replace every occurrence of the substring "dot" with a period (".").
   - Replace every occurrence of the substring "at" with the "@" symbol.

3. **Handle Leading Period:**
   - If the first character of the modified input string is a period ("."):
     - Replace the first character with "dot".

4. **Initialize Tracking Variables:**
   - Set a counter for "@" occurrences to zero.
   - Create an empty list to hold modified characters.

5. **Handle Leading "@" Symbol:**
   - If the first character of the modified input string is "@":
     - Replace the first character with "at".

6. **Process Each Character:**
   - Iterate through each character in the modified input string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If the counter for "@" is greater than zero:
         - Append the substring "at" to the list of modified characters.
         - Set the counter for "@" to 1.
       - Otherwise:
         - Append the "@" symbol to the list of modified characters.
         - Set the counter for "@" to 1.
     - If the character is not "@":
       - Append the character to the list of modified characters.

7. **Join Characters into a String:**
   - Combine the list of modified characters into a single string.

8. **Handle Trailing Period:**
   - If the last character of the combined string is a period ("."):
     - Replace the period with "dot".

9. **Output Result:**
   - Print the final modified string.
