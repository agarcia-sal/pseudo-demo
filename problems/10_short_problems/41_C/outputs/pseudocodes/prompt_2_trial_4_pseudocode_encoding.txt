1. Start by reading a line of input from the user, which is a string that may contain the words "dot" and "at".

2. Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from this string.

3. Replace every occurrence of the word "dot" in the string with the character "." (dot).

4. Replace every occurrence of the word "at" in the string with the character "@" (at symbol).

5. Check if the first character of the modified string is a dot. 
   - If it is, change the string so that it starts with "dot" followed by the rest of the string (without the original first character).

6. Initialize a counter for occurrences of "@" and create an empty list to hold the processed characters.

7. Initialize a variable to track the length of the string (though it may not be used later).

8. Check if the first character of the string is an "@".
   - If it is, modify the string so that it starts with "at" followed by the rest of the string (without the original first character).

9. Loop through each character in the modified string:
   - If the character is "@":
     - If this is not the first "@" that has been encountered (indicated by the counter), then append the string "at" to the list of processed characters and set the counter to 1.
     - Otherwise, append the "@" character to the list of processed characters and set the counter to 1.
   - If the character is not "@", simply append it to the list of processed characters.

10. Join all the characters in the list into a single string.

11. Check if the last character of the final string is a dot.
    - If it is, replace the last character with the word "dot".

12. Output the final processed string.
