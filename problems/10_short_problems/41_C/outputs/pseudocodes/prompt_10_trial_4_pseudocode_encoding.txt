Here's the pseudocode based on the provided code, structured clearly and concisely:

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Read input
    Read input line from standard input and store in variable 'a'
    Remove leading and trailing spaces from 'a'

    // Step 2: Replace keywords with respective symbols
    Replace all occurrences of "dot" in 'a' with "."
    Replace all occurrences of "at" in 'a' with "@"
    
    // Step 3: Ensure a leading "dot" if the string starts with a "."
    IF the first character of 'a' is '.' THEN
        Set 'a' to "dot" concatenated with the substring of 'a' from index 1 onward
    END IF

    // Step 4: Initialize variables for processing
    Set co to 0 // Counter for occurrences of '@'
    Create an empty list 'c' for characters
    Set l to 0 // Counter not used but initialized

    // Step 5: Check for leading "at"
    IF the first character of 'a' is '@' THEN
        Set 'a' to "at" concatenated with the substring of 'a' from index 1 onward
    END IF

    // Step 6: Process each character in 'a'
    FOR each character 'i' in 'a' DO
        IF 'i' equals "@" THEN
            IF co is greater than 0 THEN
                Append "at" to list 'c'
                Set co to 1
            ELSE
                Append "@" to list 'c'
                Set co to 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            Append 'i' to list 'c'
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 7: Join the list 'c' into a string
    Set 'c' to the concatenated string of list 'c'
    
    // Step 8: Replace a trailing dot with "dot"
    IF the last character of 'c' is '.' THEN
        Remove the last character of 'c' 
        Append "dot" to 'c'
    END IF

    // Step 9: Output the final modified string
    Print the value of 'c'
END
```

### Assumptions:
- The input consists of a single line that may contain spaces and may include the words "dot" and "at".
- The variable 'a' and final output 'c' are treated as strings throughout the algorithm.
- There are no concerns about handling empty strings or invalid formats (the code assumes "dot" and "at" are always valid when present). 

Each step in the pseudocode is structured to mirror the logic of the original code while using clear and meaningful identifiers.
