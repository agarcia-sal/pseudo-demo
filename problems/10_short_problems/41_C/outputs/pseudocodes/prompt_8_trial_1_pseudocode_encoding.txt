**Purpose Statement:** The goal of this code is to process a given string by converting specific text representations of characters (`"dot"` to `"."` and `"at"` to `"@"`), ensuring proper formatting based on the content of the string, and ultimately outputting a modified version of the string.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Read Input**
   - Accept a line of input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

3. **Replace Text Representations**
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" with the character "." in the input string.
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "at" with the character "@" in the modified string.

4. **Check Leading Character**
   - If the first character of the modified string is ".", prepend "dot" to the string.

5. **Initialize Counters and Collectors**
   - Set a counter to zero.
   - Create an empty list to hold characters.
   - Initialize a variable for list length (not explicitly used).

6. **Handle Leading "@" Character**
   - If the first character of the modified string is "@", prepend "at" to the string.

7. **Iterate Through Characters**
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If the counter is greater than zero (indicating "@" has been handled before):
         - Append "at" to the list of collected characters.
         - Set the counter back to 1.
       - Else:
         - Append "@" to the list of collected characters.
         - Set the counter to 1.
     - Else:
       - Append the current character (which is not "@") to the list of collected characters.

8. **Join Collected Characters**
   - Combine the characters in the list into a single string.

9. **Check Trailing Character**
   - If the last character of the combined string is ".":
     - Remove the last character and append "dot" in its place.

10. **Output the Result**
    - Print the final modified string.

11. **End Program**

**Example of a Revised Structure with Comments:**

```
Begin Program
   Read user input and remove whitespace
   Replace "dot" with "." in input
   Replace "at" with "@" in modified input

   If first character is "." then
       Prepend "dot" to the start of string
   End If

   Set counter = 0
   Initialize empty list for characters
   Initialize length variable (not used)

   If first character is "@" then
       Prepend "at" to the start of string
   End If

   For each character in the modified string do:
       If character is "@" then
           If counter > 0 then
               Append "at" to list
               Set counter to 1
           Else
               Append "@" to list
               Set counter to 1
           End If
       Else
           Append character to list
       End If
   End For

   Join characters from list into a single string

   If last character is "." then
       Remove last character and append "dot"
   End If

   Print final modified string
End Program
```

This pseudocode captures the essential logic and operations of the original code in a clear manner, making it easy to understand the process without needing knowledge of programming syntax.
