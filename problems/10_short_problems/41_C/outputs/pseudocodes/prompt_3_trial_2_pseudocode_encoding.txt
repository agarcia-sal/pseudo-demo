Here's the pseudocode representation of the given code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Read input from standard input and remove any leading/trailing whitespace
    INPUT string inputString FROM standard input
    REMOVE whitespace FROM inputString

    // Replace specific substrings in inputString with designated characters
    REPLACE 'dot' WITH '.' IN inputString
    REPLACE 'at' WITH '@' IN inputString

    // Check if the first character is a dot and prepend 'dot' if true
    IF inputString[0] IS '.' THEN
        SET inputString TO 'dot' + inputString[1:]

    // Initialize variables for processing
    SET countAtSymbol TO 0
    INITIALIZE empty list to store processed characters AS characterList
    SET length TO 0

    // Check if the first character is an at symbol and modify inputString if true
    IF inputString[0] IS '@' THEN
        SET inputString TO 'at' + inputString[1:]

    // Process each character in inputString
    FOR EACH character IN inputString DO
        IF character IS '@' THEN
            IF countAtSymbol IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
                // If this is not the first '@', append 'at' to characterList
                APPEND 'at' TO characterList
                SET countAtSymbol TO 1 
            ELSE
                // If this is the first '@', append '@' to characterList
                APPEND '@' TO characterList
                SET countAtSymbol TO 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            // Append non-@ characters to characterList
            APPEND character TO characterList
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the processed characters into a single string
    SET processedString TO JOIN characterList INTO a single string

    // Check if the last character of processedString is a dot
    IF processedString[-1] IS '.' THEN
        // Replace the last dot with 'dot'
        SET processedString TO processedString[0:LEN(processedString)-1] + 'dot'
    END IF

    // Output the final processed string
    OUTPUT processedString TO standard output

END
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

- The pseudocode begins with reading the input and performing replacements as directed.
- It checks for conditions regarding the first character of the input string and modifies it accordingly.
- The core part of the pseudocode involves processing each character in the input string, specifically handling occurrences of the '@' symbol differently based on whether they are the first occurrence or subsequent ones.
- Finally, the pseudocode checks the last character and performs another replacement if necessary before outputting the final processed string. 

The logical structure and flow are clear, making it understandable for someone unfamiliar with the original code.
