**Pseudocode for the Given Code:**

1. Start the program.
   
2. Read a line of input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
   
3. Replace all occurrences of the string "dot" with the character '.' in the input.
   
4. Replace all occurrences of the string "at" with the character '@' in the input.
   
5. If the first character of the modified string is '.', do the following:
   - Prepend the string "dot" to the modified string, excluding the first character.

6. Initialize a variable `count_at` to zero (to track occurrences of '@').
   
7. Initialize an empty list `output_characters` to store processed characters.
   
8. If the first character of the modified string is '@', do the following:
   - Prepend the string "at" to the modified string, excluding the first character.

9. For each character in the modified string:
   - If the character is '@':
     - If `count_at` is greater than zero, append the string "at" to `output_characters` and set `count_at` to 1.
     - Otherwise, append the character '@' to `output_characters` and set `count_at` to 1.
   - If the character is not '@', directly append it to `output_characters`.

10. Combine all elements in `output_characters` into a single string named `final_output`.

11. If the last character of `final_output` is '.', do the following:
    - Replace the last character with the string "dot".

12. Print the `final_output`.

13. End the program.
