**Purpose:**  
The program takes an input string that may represent an email-like address where certain words are replaced with symbols (specifically "dot" for "." and "at" for "@"). It processes the string to convert these words back to their corresponding symbols, ensuring the proper format of the address.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input and remove any surrounding whitespace.

2. **Replace Specific Words:**
   - Replace every occurrence of the word "dot" with the symbol "." in the string.
   - Replace every occurrence of the word "at" with the symbol "@" in the string.

3. **Ensure Proper Format:**
   - If the string starts with the symbol ".", prepend "dot" to the string.
   - Initialize a counter `counter` to track occurrences of "at."
   - Create an empty list `outputCharacters` to store processed characters.

4. **Process Each Character:**
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@" :
       - If `counter` is greater than 0 (indicating another "at" was processed before):
         - Add "at" to the `outputCharacters` list.
         - Set `counter` to 1 (to avoid multiple "at" entries).
       - Else:
         - Add "@" to the `outputCharacters` list.
         - Set `counter` to 1 (to track that an "at" has been added).
     - Else:
       - Add the character to the `outputCharacters` list as it is.

5. **Reconstruct the String:**
   - Join all elements in the `outputCharacters` list into a single string.
   - If the last character of this new string is ".": 
     - Replace the last character with "dot."

6. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final processed string.

This pseudocode maintains the logical flow and structure of the original code, focusing on clarity and accessibility.
