Here's a clear and concise pseudocode translation of the provided Python code, following the steps outlined:

```plaintext
BEGIN

  // Declare a variable to read input from standard input
  SET input_string TO read input from standard input

  // Clean up the input by replacing specific words with symbols
  REPLACE 'dot' in input_string WITH '.'
  REPLACE 'at' in input_string WITH '@'

  // If the first character is a dot, prepend 'dot' to the string
  IF first character of input_string IS '.' THEN
    SET input_string TO 'dot' + substring of input_string from index 1
  END IF

  // Initialize counters and placeholder
  SET counter TO 0
  INITIALIZE empty list called modified_list
  SET length TO 0

  // If the first character is '@', prepend 'at' to the string
  IF first character of input_string IS '@' THEN
    SET input_string TO 'at' + substring of input_string from index 1
  END IF

  // Iterate through each character in the modified input_string
  FOR each character in input_string DO

    IF character IS '@' THEN
      // Check if '@' has been used before
      IF counter IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        APPEND 'at' to modified_list
        SET counter TO 1
      ELSE
        APPEND '@' to modified_list
        SET counter TO 1
      END IF
    ELSE
      APPEND character to modified_list
    END IF

  END FOR

  // Join the modified list into a single string
  SET output_string TO join modified_list into a single string

  // If the last character is a dot, replace it with 'dot'
  IF last character of output_string IS '.' THEN
    SET output_string TO substring of output_string EXCLUDING last character + 'dot'
  END IF

  // Print the final transformed string
  PRINT output_string

END
```

### Assumptions:
- The input is assumed to be a string read from standard input.
- The operations of replacing specific substrings ('dot' and 'at') are based on string manipulation rules.
- The structure allows for basic string operations, like checking the first and last character, appending to a list, and joining a list into a string.
- The code assumes that the transformation is correct according to the specified rules and does not require error checking. 

### Notes:
- The pseudocode uses clear identifiers to improve understanding.
- Each operation is described clearly without relying on programming-specific syntax.
- The present tense is consistently used for actions to emphasize their immediate nature.
