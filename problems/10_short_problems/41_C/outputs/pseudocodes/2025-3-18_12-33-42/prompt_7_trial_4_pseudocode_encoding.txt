To provide a clear and comprehensive translation of the provided code into high-level pseudocode, we will follow the structured format outlined in the instructions. Here's how the pseudocode unfolds:

```
FUNCTION processEmailAddress(inputString)
    // Read input string and remove leading/trailing whitespace
    inputString = Read input from standard input and strip whitespace
    
    // Replace occurrences of 'dot' with '.' and 'at' with '@'
    inputString = Replace 'dot' with '.'
    inputString = Replace 'at' with '@'
    
    // Ensure the email format starts correctly
    IF the first character of inputString is '.' THEN
        inputString = 'dot' followed by the substring of inputString from index 1
    END IF
    
    // Initialize counter and list for processed characters
    counter = 0
    resultCharacters = empty list to store processed characters
    
    // Check if the email string starts with '@'
    IF the first character of inputString is '@' THEN
        inputString = 'at' followed by the substring of inputString from index 1
    END IF
    
    // Iterate through each character in the modified inputString
    FOR each character in inputString DO
        IF the character is '@' THEN
            // If we have seen an '@' before, append 'at' to the result list
            IF counter > 0 THEN
                Append 'at' to resultCharacters
                counter = 1 // Reset counter for the next '@'
            ELSE
                Append '@' to resultCharacters
                counter = 1 // Set counter indicating we've now seen an '@'
            END IF
        ELSE
            // Append the current character to the result list
            Append the character to resultCharacters
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Join the processed characters into a single string
    outputString = Join all characters in resultCharacters into a single string
    
    // If the output string ends with '.', replace it with 'dot'
    IF the last character of outputString is '.' THEN
        outputString = Remove the last character of outputString and append 'dot'
    END IF
    
    // Print the final processed email address
    Print outputString
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:
- **Input and Output:** The input is read from standard input, representing a potentially erroneous email address. The output is the corrected email address printed on the standard output.
- **Function Logic:** The main operations involve formatting the email address by replacing specific terms (`dot` and `at`), ensuring the correct starting characters, and handling repetitive `@` signs. The use of a list to accumulate characters ensures efficient string manipulation.
- **Controlled Structures:** The pseudocode clearly reflects control statements like conditional checks and loops that adapt based on the input conditions.
- **Clarity and Meaningful Naming:** All variable names and operations are chosen to be descriptive, ensuring the logic is easy to follow even without prior knowledge of the original implementation.
