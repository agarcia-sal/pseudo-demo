**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Read a line of input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
   
2. **Replace Substrings:**
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" with the character "." in the input string.
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "at" with the character "@" in the modified string.
   
3. **Prefix Adjustment:**
   - If the first character of the modified string is ".", prepend the word "dot" to the string, starting from the second character.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a counter variable named `counter` and set it to 0.
   - Create an empty list named `outputCharacters` to store the characters of the final output.
   - Initialize a variable named `length` to 0.

5. **Handle Leading Character:**
   - If the first character of the modified string is "@", replace it with the word "at" and keep the rest of the string unchanged.

6. **Iterate Through Each Character:**
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If `counter` is greater than 0:
         - Append the word "at" to the list of `outputCharacters`.
         - Set `counter` to 1.
       - Otherwise:
         - Append the character "@" to the list of `outputCharacters`.
         - Set `counter` to 1.
     - If the character is not "@":
       - Append the character to the list of `outputCharacters`.

7. **Join Characters:**
   - Combine the list of `outputCharacters` into a single string.

8. **Trailing Character Adjustment:**
   - If the last character of the joined string is ".":
     - Replace the last character with the word "dot".

9. **Output Result:**
   - Display the final adjusted string.
