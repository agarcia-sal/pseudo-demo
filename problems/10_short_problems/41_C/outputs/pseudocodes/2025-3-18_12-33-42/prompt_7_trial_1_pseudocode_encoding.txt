Here's a high-level pseudocode translation that accurately describes the logic and operations of the provided Python code. 

```plaintext
FUNCTION processInputEmail()
    // Read input from the user
    INPUT emailString FROM standard input
    // Clean up the email string by replacing specific words with symbols
    REPLACE all occurrences of 'dot' with '.' IN emailString
    REPLACE all occurrences of 'at' with '@' IN emailString
    
    // Ensure the email starts with 'dot' if it begins with a '.'
    IF emailString[0] is '.' THEN
        PREPEND 'dot' to emailString (keep the rest intact)
    END IF
    
    INITIALIZE countOfAtSymbols AS 0
    INITIALIZE resultList AS empty list
    INITIALIZE lengthOfEmail AS 0
    
    // Ensure the email starts with 'at' if it begins with an '@'
    IF emailString[0] is '@' THEN
        PREPEND 'at' to emailString (keep the rest intact)
    END IF
    
    // Process each character in the email string
    FOR each character IN emailString DO
        IF character is '@' THEN
            IF countOfAtSymbols is greater than 0 THEN
                APPEND 'at' to resultList
                SET countOfAtSymbols to 1
            ELSE
                APPEND '@' to resultList
                SET countOfAtSymbols to 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            APPEND character to resultList
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Join all elements in resultList into a single string
    SET cleanedEmailString as JOIN(resultList)
    
    // Replace the last character with 'dot' if it is a '.'
    IF last character of cleanedEmailString is '.' THEN
        REMOVE last character of cleanedEmailString
        APPEND 'dot' to cleanedEmailString
    END IF
    
    // Output the final cleaned email string
    PRINT cleanedEmailString
END FUNCTION
```

### Key Points Explained:
- The input is read from standard input, similar to reading a line in Python.
- Specific words ('dot' and 'at') are replaced with their respective symbols ('.' and '@').
- There's a check to prepend 'dot' to the email string if it starts with '.'.
- A list is constructed to capture characters, where '@' is managed to avoid duplication.
- At the end, if the last character is '.', it is replaced with 'dot'.
- The final result is printed, reflecting the cleaned-up email format. 

This pseudocode captures the structure and logic of the original code, making it understandable and clear without getting into the specifics of programming syntax.
