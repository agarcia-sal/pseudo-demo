Here is the pseudocode that reflects the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
BEGIN

    // Read input from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace
    INPUT string userInput
    userInput = REMOVE_WHITESPACE(userInput)

    // Replace occurrences of 'dot' with '.' and 'at' with '@' in the input string
    userInput = REPLACE(userInput, 'dot', '.')
    userInput = REPLACE(userInput, 'at', '@')

    // If the first character is '.', prepend 'dot' to the string
    IF userInput[0] IS EQUAL TO '.' THEN
        userInput = 'dot' + userInput[1 TO END]
    END IF

    // Initialize variables
    counter = 0
    transformedCharacters = []
    
    // Check if the first character is '@'
    IF userInput[0] IS EQUAL TO '@' THEN
        userInput = 'at' + userInput[1 TO END]
    END IF

    // Loop through each character in the modified input string
    FOR each character IN userInput DO
        IF character IS EQUAL TO '@' THEN
            // If '@' has already been added once, add 'at' instead
            IF counter IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
                ADD 'at' TO transformedCharacters
                counter = 1
            ELSE
                ADD '@' TO transformedCharacters
                counter = 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            // Add any non-'@' character to the list
            ADD character TO transformedCharacters
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the list of characters back into a single string
    finalOutput = JOIN(transformedCharacters)

    // If the last character of the output string is '.', replace it with 'dot'
    IF finalOutput[-1] IS EQUAL TO '.' THEN
        finalOutput = REMOVE_LAST_CHARACTER(finalOutput) + 'dot'
    END IF

    // Print the final transformed string
    OUTPUT finalOutput

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling:** It begins by reading a string from input and making sure there are no unnecessary spaces at the beginning or end.
2. **Character Replacements:** The code replaces specific substrings ('dot' and 'at') with their respective symbols ('.' and '@').
3. **Special Cases:** It checks if the string starts with '.' or '@' and prepends 'dot' or 'at' accordingly.
4. **Character Processing:** It processes each character in the adjusted string, handling occurrences of '@' specially to keep track of how many times it appears.
5. **Output Adjustment:** It modifies the final string if it ends with '.', replacing it with 'dot'.
6. **Output:** Finally, it prints the transformed string. 

This pseudocode is structured to be understandable, even for individuals without programming experience, while keeping the essence of the original code's functionality.
