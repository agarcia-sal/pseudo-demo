Here's the pseudocode that captures the essence of the provided Python code while focusing on clarity and structure:

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Read input from the user
    DECLARE inputString AS STRING
    READ inputString FROM standard input
    
    // Replace occurrences of 'dot' with '.' and 'at' with '@'
    REPLACE 'dot' WITH '.' IN inputString
    REPLACE 'at' WITH '@' IN inputString

    // Check if the first character is a dot
    IF first character of inputString IS '.' THEN
        PREPEND 'dot' TO inputString
    
    // Initialize variables for processing
    DECLARE consecutiveAtCount AS INTEGER = 0
    DECLARE resultString AS LIST OF CHARACTERS
    DECLARE index AS INTEGER
    
    // Check if the first character is an at symbol
    IF first character of inputString IS '@' THEN
        PREPEND 'at' TO inputString

    // Iterate over each character in the input string
    FOR EACH character IN inputString DO
        IF character IS '@' THEN
            // If the current character is an '@'
            IF consecutiveAtCount > 0 THEN
                APPEND 'at' TO resultString
                SET consecutiveAtCount TO 1 
            ELSE
                APPEND '@' TO resultString
                SET consecutiveAtCount TO 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            // If the current character is not '@'
            APPEND character TO resultString
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the result list back into a string
    DECLARE finalString AS STRING
    SET finalString TO JOIN resultString INTO A SINGLE STRING
    
    // Check if the last character of resulting string is a dot
    IF last character of finalString IS '.' THEN
        REMOVE last character FROM finalString
        APPEND 'dot' TO finalString
    END IF

    // Output the final modified string
    PRINT finalString

END PROGRAM
```

### Breakdown of the Pseudocode:
1. **Inputs and Outputs:** It begins with reading from standard input and defining what the output will be (the modified string).
2. **Replacements:** Clearly indicates how specific substrings are replaced.
3. **Character Processing:** Explains the logic of iterating through each character, maintaining state about consecutive '@' symbols.
4. **Final Adjustments:** Ultimately checks the last character and adjusts accordingly.
5. **Clarity and Structure:** The pseudocode maintains organized branches and loops, allowing anyone analyzing the logic to follow along easily without getting lost in specific programming syntax.
