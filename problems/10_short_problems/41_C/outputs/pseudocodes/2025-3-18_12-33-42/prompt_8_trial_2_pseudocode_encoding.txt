**Purpose**: The primary goal of this code is to transform a string by replacing specific keywords with symbols, ensuring proper formatting for email-like structures.

**Pseudocode**:

```
START

// Read the input from the standard input and remove any leading or trailing spaces
INPUT string = get input from user and trim whitespace

// Replace occurrences of the word 'dot' with the symbol '.'
string = replace 'dot' in string with '.'

// Replace occurrences of the word 'at' with the symbol '@'
string = replace 'at' in string with '@'

// If the first character is '.', prepend 'dot' to the string
IF the first character of string is '.'
    string = 'dot' + substring of string from index 1 onwards

// Initialize a counter for '@' occurrences and an empty list for characters
counter = 0
output_characters = empty list
length = 0

// If the first character is '@', prepend 'at' to the string
IF the first character of string is '@'
    string = 'at' + substring of string from index 1 onwards

// For each character in the modified string
FOR each character in string
    IF character is '@'
        // If there was a previous occurrence of '@', append 'at'; reset counter
        IF counter > 0
            append 'at' to output_characters
            counter = 1
        ELSE
            // Otherwise, append '@' to output_characters; set counter to 1
            append '@' to output_characters
            counter = 1
    ELSE
        // Append the current character to the output list
        append character to output_characters

// Join the characters in output_characters into a single string
output_string = join output_characters into a single string

// If the last character of the output_string is '.', replace it with 'dot'
IF the last character of output_string is '.'
    output_string = substring of output_string from start to second last character + 'dot'

// Print the final transformed string
PRINT output_string

END
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The code performs replacements to help format email-like inputs, ensuring that terms such as "dot" and "at" are correctly interpreted as their symbol counterparts.
- It also handles special cases where the formatted string should be adjusted based on the presence of these symbols at the beginning or end of the string.
