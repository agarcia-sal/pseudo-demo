The code provided is a script that processes an email address or similar string by converting specific keywords to their respective characters. Below is the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the code.

```plaintext
FUNCTION processEmailAddress(inputString)
    // Read the input string from standard input and strip whitespace
    inputString = readInput() // Assume this reads input and returns a cleaned string

    // Replace occurrences of keywords with corresponding symbols 
    inputString = replace 'dot' with '.' in inputString
    inputString = replace 'at' with '@' in inputString

    // If the first character is a dot, prepend 'dot' to the string
    IF inputString starts with '.' THEN
        inputString = 'dot' + substring(inputString, 1 to end)
    END IF

    // Initialize a counter and a container for characters
    counter = 0
    characters = empty list

    // If the first character is an '@', prepend 'at' to the string
    IF inputString starts with '@' THEN
        inputString = 'at' + substring(inputString, 1 to end)
    END IF

    // Iterate through each character in the inputString
    FOR each character in inputString DO
        IF character is '@' THEN
            // If we've already added an '@' before, add 'at' instead
            IF counter > 0 THEN 
                append 'at' to characters list
                counter = 1
            ELSE
                append '@' to characters list
                counter = 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            append character to characters list
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the characters back into a single string
    outputString = joinCharacters(characters)

    // If the last character is a '.', replace it with 'dot'
    IF outputString ends with '.' THEN
        outputString = substring(outputString, 0 to second last) + 'dot'
    END IF

    // Output the final processed string
    print(outputString)
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Complexity:

1. **Input Processing:** Initially, the code handles input directly from the system's standard input. The pseudocode simplifies this by assuming a function that reads and cleans the input.
  
2. **String Replacement Logic:** The code conducts specific string replacements, such as keywords for both 'dot' and 'at', which is directly captured in the pseudocode through descriptive comments.

3. **Iterative Character Handling:** The loop structure accounts for the special handling of multiple '@' characters. If subsequent '@' symbols are detected, they are replaced based on earlier conditions.

4. **Output Modification:** The final check adjusts for any trailing dots, which is relevant in email formatting, showing an awareness of what constitutes valid output.

This pseudocode provides a clear and structured understanding that mirrors the logic of the original code while using approachable language and high-level operations.
