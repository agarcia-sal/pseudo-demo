**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   Read a line of input, which represents a string that may contain the words "dot" and "at".

2. **Replace Placeholders:**
   Replace every occurrence of the word "dot" with a literal period (.) in the input string.
   Replace every occurrence of the word "at" with a literal at symbol (@).

3. **Check Leading Character:**
   If the first character of the modified string is a period (.):
       - Prepend the word "dot" to the string (to indicate that it originally started with "dot").

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   Initialize a counter for occurrences of the at symbol (set to zero).
   Initialize an empty list to hold characters of the final output string.
   Initialize a variable to track the current length of the output string (set to zero).

5. **Check for Leading At Symbol:**
   If the first character of the modified string is an at symbol (@):
       - Prepend the word "at" to the string (to indicate that it originally started with "at").

6. **Process Each Character:**
   For each character in the modified string:
       - If the current character is an at symbol (@):
           - If the counter indicates that we have already added an at symbol:
               - Append the word "at" to the list of characters.
               - Reset the counter.
           - Otherwise:
               - Append the literal character @ to the list of characters.
               - Set the counter to indicate that an at symbol has been added.
       - If the current character is not an at symbol:
           - Append the character to the list.

7. **Construct Output String:**
   Join all characters from the list into a single output string.

8. **Check Trailing Character:**
   If the last character of the constructed output string is a period (.):
       - Replace the period with the word "dot".

9. **Output Result:**
   Display the final output string.
