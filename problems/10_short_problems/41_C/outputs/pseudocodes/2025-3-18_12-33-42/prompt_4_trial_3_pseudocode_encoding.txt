Here is the pseudocode based on the provided code logic:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Read input from the user
    INPUT string a

    // Replace occurrences of specific words with symbols
    REPLACE 'dot' with '.' in a
    REPLACE 'at' with '@' in a

    // If the string starts with a dot, change the first character
    IF a[0] is '.' THEN
        a = 'dot' + a from index 1 to end
    END IF

    // Initialize variables for processing
    SET counter to 0
    CREATE empty list characters
    SET length to 0

    // If the string starts with '@', change the first character
    IF a[0] is '@' THEN
        a = 'at' + a from index 1 to end
    END IF

    // Iterate through each character in the string
    FOR each character i in a DO
        IF i is '@' THEN
            IF counter is greater than 0 THEN
                APPEND 'at' to characters
                SET counter to 1
            ELSE
                APPEND '@' to characters
                SET counter to 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            APPEND i to characters
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the characters list into a single string
    SET result to join characters into a string

    // If the result ends with a dot, replace it with 'dot'
    IF last character of result is '.' THEN
        result = result from start to second last character + 'dot'
    END IF

    // Print the final output
    PRINT result

END
```

This pseudocode captures the logic and flow of the original code comprehensively while maintaining readability and clarity. The main operations are clearly described, and variable names are chosen to reflect their purpose in the algorithm.
