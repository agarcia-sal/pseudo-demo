**Purpose:** The objective of this algorithm is to convert a string input into a specific email format by replacing certain keywords with symbols, adjusting its structure as needed.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a string input from the user.

2. **Replace Keywords with Symbols:**
   - Replace every occurrence of the word "dot" with the symbol "." in the input string.
   - Replace every occurrence of the word "at" with the symbol "@" in the input string.

3. **Check for Leading Character:**
   - If the first character of the modified string is a ".", prepend "dot" to the string.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter for "at" symbols to 0.
   - Create an empty list to store the processed characters.

5. **Check for Leading "at":**
   - If the first character of the modified string is an "@", replace it with "at".

6. **Iterate Over Each Character in the String:**
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If the counter is greater than 0:
         - Append "at" to the character list.
         - Set the counter to 1.
       - Else:
         - Append "@" to the character list.
         - Set the counter to 1.
     - Else:
       - Append the character to the character list.

7. **Join Processed Characters:**
   - Combine all elements in the character list into a single string.

8. **Check for Trailing Character:**
   - If the last character of the combined string is a ".":
     - Replace it with the word "dot" to avoid trailing dots.

9. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final formatted string to the user.

By following this structured approach, the pseudocode makes it easy to understand how the original code transforms an input string into a properly formatted email representation.
