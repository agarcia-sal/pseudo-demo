Here's the pseudocode based on the provided Python code:

```
BEGIN
    // Read a line of input and remove leading/trailing whitespace
    SET inputString TO read input from standard input
    TRIM inputString

    // Replace specific substrings
    REPLACE 'dot' with '.' in inputString
    REPLACE 'at' with '@' in inputString
    
    // Check if the first character is a dot
    IF inputString starts with '.' THEN
        SET inputString TO 'dot' + substring of inputString from index 1 TO end
    ENDIF

    // Initialize variables
    SET countAt TO 0
    SET characterList TO an empty list
    SET length TO 0

    // Check if the first character is an at symbol
    IF inputString starts with '@' THEN
        SET inputString TO 'at' + substring of inputString from index 1 TO end
    ENDIF

    // Iterate over each character in inputString
    FOR each character in inputString DO
        IF character IS '@' THEN
            IF countAt > 0 THEN
                // Add 'at' to the list if we already have an '@'
                APPEND 'at' to characterList
                SET countAt TO 1 
            ELSE
                // Add '@' to the list
                APPEND '@' to characterList
                SET countAt TO 1
            ENDIF
            ELSE
                // Add the character to the list
                APPEND character to characterList
            ENDIF
        END FOR

    // Join characterList into a string
    SET modifiedString TO join characters in characterList into a single string

    // Check if the last character is a dot
    IF modifiedString ends with '.' THEN
        REPLACE last character with 'dot' in modifiedString
    ENDIF

    // Output the final modified string
    PRINT modifiedString
END
```

### Assumptions:
- The input is received from standard input and is a string.
- Operations such as `substring`, `join`, and list manipulation are allowed and understood in this structured pseudocode.
- The behavior of the program relies on the proper formatting of the input string.
