Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that reflects the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION processEmailInput()

    // Read a line of input and remove leading/trailing whitespace
    INPUT emailString FROM standard input
    
    // Replace occurrences of 'dot' with '.' and 'at' with '@'
    REPLACE 'dot' WITH '.' IN emailString
    REPLACE 'at' WITH '@' IN emailString
    
    // If the email string starts with a '.', prepend 'dot' to it
    IF emailString STARTS WITH '.' THEN
        emailString = 'dot' + emailString WITHOUT first character
        
    CO_count = 0  // Counter for '@' occurrences
    modifiedCharacters = []  // List to hold the modified characters
    length = 0  // Not used in this code; could be removed

    // If the email string starts with an '@', prepend 'at' to it
    IF emailString STARTS WITH '@' THEN
        emailString = 'at' + emailString WITHOUT first character
        
    // Iterate through each character in the email string
    FOR EACH character IN emailString DO
        // Check if the character is '@'
        IF character EQUALS '@' THEN
            IF CO_count GREATER THAN 0 THEN
                ADD 'at' TO modifiedCharacters
                CO_count = 1  // Set counter to indicate we've added an '@' 
            ELSE 
                ADD '@' TO modifiedCharacters
                CO_count = 1  // Set counter to indicate we've added an '@'
            END IF
        ELSE
            // Add the character as it is
            ADD character TO modifiedCharacters
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Join the modified characters into a single string
    modifiedEmailString = JOIN modifiedCharacters INTO a string
    
    // If the modified email string ends with a '.', replace it with 'dot'
    IF modifiedEmailString ENDS WITH '.' THEN
        modifiedEmailString = REMOVE last character FROM modifiedEmailString
        modifiedEmailString = modifiedEmailString + 'dot'
    END IF
    
    // Output the final modified email string
    PRINT modifiedEmailString
    
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function processes an email input string by replacing specific substrings and adjusting format based on certain conditions.
2. **Input/Output**: The input is read from standard input and the output is a modified string that adheres to specific rules for handling 'dot' and 'at'.
3. **Control Structures**: It uses conditionals to check starting and ending characters, iterates over the input to build a new string while handling repetitive '@' characters.
4. **Logical Flow**: The pseudocode clearly outlines the sequence of operations, making it easy to follow the logic without diving into syntax-specific details.
