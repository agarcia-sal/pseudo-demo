**Pseudocode:**

1. Read a line of input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
2. Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" in the input with a period (.)
3. Replace all occurrences of the word "at" in the input with the "@" symbol.
4. If the first character of the modified input is a period:
   - Prepend the word "dot" to the modified input (excluding the period).
5. Initialize a counter (co) to 0 for tracking the occurrence of the "@" symbol.
6. Create an empty list (c) to store characters of the final output.
7. If the first character of the modified input is an "@" symbol:
   - Prepend the word "at" to the modified input (excluding the "@" symbol).
8. For each character in the modified input:
   a. If the character is "@":
      - If the counter (co) is greater than 0:
        - Append the word "at" to the list (c).
        - Set the counter (co) to 1.
      - Otherwise:
        - Append the "@" symbol to the list (c).
        - Set the counter (co) to 1.
   b. If the character is not an "@" symbol:
      - Append the character to the list (c).
9. Join all elements in the list (c) into a single string.
10. If the last character of the final output string is a period:
    - Remove the period from the end and append the word "dot".
11. Output the final processed string.
