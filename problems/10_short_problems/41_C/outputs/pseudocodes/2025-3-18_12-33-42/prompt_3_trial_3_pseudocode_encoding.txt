Below is the pseudocode that encapsulates the logic and intent of the provided code snippet while maintaining clarity and readability.

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read input string
    INPUT originalString

    // Step 2: Normalize input by replacing specific words with symbols
    REPLACE occurrences of "dot" with "." in originalString
    REPLACE occurrences of "at" with "@" in originalString

    // Step 3: Ensure the string starts correctly
    IF first character of originalString IS "." THEN
        SET modifiedString TO "dot" + remainder of originalString WITHOUT first character

    // Step 4: Initialize variables for processing
    SET atCounter TO 0
    INITIALIZE emptyList c
    INITIALIZE length l TO 0

    // Step 5: Check for "at" at the beginning
    IF first character of modifiedString IS "@" THEN
        SET modifiedString TO "at" + remainder of modifiedString WITHOUT first character

    // Step 6: Iterate through each character in modifiedString
    FOR each character in modifiedString DO
        IF character IS "@" THEN
            // Check if this is the first "at" occurrence or a continuation
            IF atCounter > 0 THEN
                APPEND "at" to list c
                SET atCounter TO 1  // Continue counting "at"
            ELSE
                APPEND "@" to list c
                SET atCounter TO 1  // First "at" occurrence
            END IF
        ELSE
            // Append non-"at" characters directly
            APPEND character to list c
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 7: Construct the final string from list c
    SET finalString TO JOIN elements of c into a single string

    // Step 8: Adjust if the final string ends with a dot
    IF last character of finalString IS "." THEN
        SET finalString TO substring of finalString WITHOUT last character + "dot"

    // Step 9: Output the final adjusted string
    OUTPUT finalString

END
```
### Explanation of the Pseudocode Structure:

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts by indicating that it takes a string input named `originalString`.

2. **Normalization Process:** It emphasizes that specific substitutions are made to convert words ("dot" and "at") into symbols (".", "@").

3. **String Modifications:** It checks for the initial character to ensure proper formatting and makes adjustments accordingly.

4. **Character Iteration:** It iterates over each character in the string while keeping track of occurrences of the '@' symbol and appending characters to the list, clearly indicating how it manages repeated occurrences.

5. **Final Output Construction:** The final string is created and adjusted if necessary before being output to the user.

This structured approach provides clarity and maintains the intent of the original code while being understandable to someone unfamiliar with its specific syntax.
