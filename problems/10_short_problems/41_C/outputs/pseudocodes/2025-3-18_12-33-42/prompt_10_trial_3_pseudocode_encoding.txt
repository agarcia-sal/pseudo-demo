**Pseudocode Translation:**

```
BEGIN

    // Read input
    SET inputString TO read a line from standard input
    REMOVE leading and trailing whitespace from inputString
    
    // Replace specific terms with symbols
    REPLACE all occurrences of "dot" in inputString with "."
    REPLACE all occurrences of "at" in inputString with "@"
    
    // Check for leading dot and adjust
    IF the first character of inputString is "." THEN
        SET inputString TO "dot" + the substring of inputString from index 1 onward

    // Initialize count and output list
    SET countOfAt TO 0
    INITIALIZE empty list c
    SET length TO 0
    
    // Check for leading at and adjust
    IF the first character of inputString is "@" THEN
        SET inputString TO "at" + the substring of inputString from index 1 onward
    
    // Process each character in inputString
    FOR each character in inputString DO
        IF character is "@" THEN
            IF countOfAt greater than 0 THEN
                APPEND "at" to list c
                SET countOfAt TO 1
            ELSE
                APPEND "@" to list c
                SET countOfAt TO 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            APPEND character to list c
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the list into a single string
    SET finalString TO join all elements in list c into a single string
    
    // Check for trailing dot and adjust
    IF the last character of finalString is "." THEN
        SET finalString TO the substring of finalString up to the last character plus "dot"
    END IF

    // Output the final result
    PRINT finalString

END
```

### Assumptions:
- The input is treated as a string throughout and operations are performed accordingly.
- The functions `read`, `replace`, `append`, and `join` operate as they would in typical programming languages.
- The string manipulations consider the index-based access commonly found in programming languages.
