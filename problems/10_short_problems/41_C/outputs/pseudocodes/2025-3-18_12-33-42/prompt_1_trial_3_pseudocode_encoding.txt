**Pseudocode:**

BEGIN

    INPUT stringInput FROM user

    // Replace occurrences of 'dot' with '.' and 'at' with '@'
    REPLACE 'dot' IN stringInput WITH '.'
    REPLACE 'at' IN stringInput WITH '@'

    // If the first character is a dot, prepend 'dot' to the string
    IF FIRST CHARACTER OF stringInput IS '.' THEN
        stringInput = 'dot' + substring AFTER first character

    // Initialize a counter and an empty list for building the output
    countAtSymbols = 0
    resultList = []
    
    // Check if the first character is '@', if so, prepend 'at' to the string
    IF FIRST CHARACTER OF stringInput IS '@' THEN
        stringInput = 'at' + substring AFTER first character
        
    // Iterate through each character in the modified string
    FOR EACH character IN stringInput DO
        IF character IS '@' THEN
            // If '@' has been seen before, replace it with 'at', else keep '@'
            IF countAtSymbols > 0 THEN
                APPEND 'at' TO resultList
                countAtSymbols = 1
            ELSE
                APPEND '@' TO resultList
                countAtSymbols = 1
        ELSE
            // For any other character, append it to the result list
            APPEND character TO resultList
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the list of characters into a single string
    outputString = JOIN resultList INTO A SINGLE STRING

    // If the last character is a dot, replace it with 'dot'
    IF LAST CHARACTER OF outputString IS '.' THEN
