1. Begin by reading a line of input from the user and remove any leading or trailing spaces.
2. Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" with a period (".").
3. Replace all occurrences of the word "at" with the "@" symbol.
4. Check if the formatted string starts with a period ("."):
   - If it does, prepend the word "dot" to the string, keeping the rest of it unchanged from the second character onward.
5. Initialize a counter to track occurrences of the "@" symbol and create an empty list to collect characters for the final output.
6. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current length of the string, though it is not utilized further.
7. If the string starts with the "@" symbol:
   - Replace it with the word "at", keeping the rest of the string unchanged from the second character onward.
8. For every character in the modified string:
   - If the character is the "@" symbol:
     - If the counter has already counted a previous "@" instance:
       - Append the word "at" to the list.
       - Set the counter to indicate that a "@" has been counted.
     - If it's the first occurrence of "@":
       - Append the "@" symbol itself to the list.
       - Set the counter to indicate that this is now an active "@".
   - For all other characters, append them directly to the list.
9. Combine all the items in the list into a single string.
10. Check if the last character of the string is a period (".""):
    - If it is, replace the period with the word "dot".
11. Output the final formatted string.
