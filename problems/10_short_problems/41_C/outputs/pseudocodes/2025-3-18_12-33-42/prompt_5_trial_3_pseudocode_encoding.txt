**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to transform a given input string into a specific email format by replacing certain keywords with corresponding symbols and ensuring the output adheres to the typical structure of an email address.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user and remove any surrounding whitespace.
   
2. **Replace Keywords:**
   - Replace every instance of the word "dot" with the symbol "." (dot).
   - Replace every instance of the word "at" with the symbol "@" (at).

3. **Check for Leading Dot:**
   - If the modified string starts with a dot:
     - Prepend "dot" to the string, excluding the first character (the leading dot).

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter `count` to 0.
   - Create an empty list `char_list` to hold characters of the processed string.
   - Initialize a variable `length` to 0 (not used subsequently).

5. **Check for Leading At Symbol:**
   - If the modified string starts with the at symbol "@":
     - Prepend "at" to the string, excluding the first character (the leading @).

6. **Process Each Character:**
   - For each character in the processed string:
     - If the character is an "@" symbol:
       - If `count` is greater than 0:
         - Append the string "at" to `char_list`.
         - Set `count` to 1.
       - Else:
         - Append the character "@" to `char_list`.
         - Set `count` to 1.
     - Else:
       - Append the character to `char_list`.

7. **Reconstruct the String:**
   - Join all elements in `char_list` to form a new string `final_string`.

8. **Check for Trailing Dot:**
   - If `final_string` ends with a dot:
     - Remove the dot and append "dot" to the end of the string.

9. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final formatted string.

**Comments:**
- The function effectively converts specific keywords into their corresponding email symbols.
- It ensures proper formatting by adding "dot" or "at" where necessary and prevents consecutive "@" placements.
- The output is designed to be suitable for an email address format without invalid characters at the start or end.

**Example Structure:**
```
START PROGRAM

READ input_string
REPLACE "dot" with "." in input_string
REPLACE "at" with "@" in input_string

IF input_string starts with "." THEN
    PREPEND "dot" to input_string
END IF

INITIALIZE count to 0
INITIALIZE char_list as empty list

IF input_string starts with "@" THEN
    PREPEND "at" to input_string
END IF

FOR each character in input_string DO
    IF character is "@" THEN
        IF count > 0 THEN
            APPEND "at" to char_list
            SET count to 1
        ELSE
            APPEND "@" to char_list
            SET count to 1
        END IF
    ELSE
        APPEND character to char_list
    END IF
END FOR

JOIN char_list to form final_string

IF final_string ends with "." THEN
    REMOVE "." and APPEND "dot" to final_string
END IF

PRINT final_string

END PROGRAM
```
