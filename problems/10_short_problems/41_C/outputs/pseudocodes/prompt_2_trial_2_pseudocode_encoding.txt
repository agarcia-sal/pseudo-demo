**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user and remove any extra spaces around it.

2. **Replace Substrings:**
   - Replace all occurrences of the substring "dot" with a period "." in the input.
   - Replace all occurrences of the substring "at" with the symbol "@" in the modified input.

3. **Handle Leading Period:**
   - If the modified input starts with a period ".":
     - Change the start of the input to "dot" followed by the rest of the input from the second character onward.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a counter `co` set to 0 for tracking occurrences of "@".
   - Create an empty list `c` to store characters of the final output.
   - Set a length variable `l` to 0 (not used in this pseudocode but kept for structure).

5. **Handle Leading "At" Symbol:**
   - If the modified input starts with "@":
     - Change the start of the input to "at" followed by the remaining characters from the second position onward.

6. **Iterate Through Each Character:**
   - For each character `i` in the modified input:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If `co` is greater than 0 (indicating that an "@" has already been added):
         - Append "at" to the list `c`.
         - Set `co` back to 1.
       - Else (if this is the first "@" encountered):
         - Append "@" to the list `c`.
         - Set `co` to 1 to indicate that an "@" has been added.
     - Else (if the character is not "@"):
       - Append the character `i` to the list `c`.

7. **Combine Characters:**
   - Join all elements in the list `c` into a single string.

8. **Handle Trailing Period:**
   - If the last character in the combined string is a period ".":
     - Remove the last character and append "dot" instead.

9. **Output Result:**
   - Print the final modified string.

**End of Pseudocode.**
