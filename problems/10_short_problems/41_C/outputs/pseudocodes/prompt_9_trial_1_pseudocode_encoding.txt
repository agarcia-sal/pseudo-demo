**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to transform a given input string into a standardized email address format by replacing specific words with their symbols and ensuring a valid structure.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user.
   - Remove any leading or trailing spaces.

2. **Replace Specific Words:**
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" with the symbol "." in the input string.
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "at" with the symbol "@" in the modified string.

3. **Ensure Starting Character:**
   - If the modified string starts with a ".", prepend "dot" to the beginning of the string.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter for occurrences of "@" to 0.
   - Create an empty list to hold characters for the final output.
   - Set a length variable to 0 (not used in this logic).

5. **Check for Starting "at":**
   - If the modified string starts with an "@", change the first character to "at" and keep the rest of the string unchanged. 

6. **Character Processing:**
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If the counter is greater than 0, append the word "at" to the list and set the counter to 1.
       - Otherwise, append "@" to the list and set the counter to 1.
     - If the character is not "@", append it to the list as is.

7. **Join List to Form a String:**
   - Combine all characters in the list into a single string.

8. **Ensure Valid Ending:**
   - If the final string ends with a ".", replace the last character with "dot".

9. **Output Result:**
   - Display the final modified string.

**Final Check:**
- Ensure that the pseudocode accurately reflects the logic and process of the original code without any loss of meaning or intent.
