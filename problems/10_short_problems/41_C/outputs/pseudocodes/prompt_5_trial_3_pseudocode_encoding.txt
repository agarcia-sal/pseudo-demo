### Purpose
The goal of this program is to process a string representing an email address by converting specific keywords into their character representations, ensuring the format adheres to typical email standards.

### Pseudocode

1. **Start of Program**
   - Read a line of input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Replace Keywords**
   - Replace all occurrences of "dot" in the input with the character ".".
   - Replace all occurrences of "at" in the input with the character "@".

3. **Adjust Starting Character**
   - If the first character of the modified string is a ".", then prepend "dot" to it.

4. **Initialize Variables**
   - Set a counter named `atCounter` to 0.
   - Create an empty list named `resultList`.
   - Initialize a variable `length` to 0 (this variable is not used in this pseudocode, consider removing if unnecessary).

5. **Handle Starting "at" Character**
   - If the modified string starts with "@", then change the first character to "at".

6. **Process Each Character**
   - For each character in the modified string:
      - If the character is an "@" symbol:
          - If `atCounter` is greater than 0:
              - Append "at" to the `resultList`.
              - Set `atCounter` back to 1.
          - Otherwise:
              - Append the "@" symbol to the `resultList`.
              - Set `atCounter` to 1.
      - If the character is not "@", append the character directly to the `resultList`.

7. **Join Result Characters**
   - Combine all characters in `resultList` into a single string called `finalString`.

8. **Adjust Ending Character**
   - If the last character of `finalString` is ".", then change it to "dot" (by removing the last character and appending "dot" instead).

9. **Output the Result**
   - Print the modified string `finalString`.

10. **End of Program**

### Notes:
- The program effectively handles input strings that simulate email addresses, ensuring typical formatting is followed by handling specific keywords.
- Redundant or unused variables may be simplified further during implementation to enhance clarity.
