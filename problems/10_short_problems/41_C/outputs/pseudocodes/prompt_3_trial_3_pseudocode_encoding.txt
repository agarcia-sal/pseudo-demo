Here's a structured pseudocode representation for the provided code snippet:

```
START

// Read input from the user
READ inputString

// Replace occurrences of 'dot' with '.' and 'at' with '@'
REPLACE 'dot' in inputString WITH '.'
REPLACE 'at' in inputString WITH '@'

// If the first character is '.', prepend 'dot'
IF inputString's first character is '.'
    SET inputString = 'dot' + inputString starting from the second character

// Initialize a counter and an empty list to store characters
SET counter = 0
SET characterList = EMPTY LIST

// If the first character is '@', prepend 'at'
IF inputString's first character is '@'
    SET inputString = 'at' + inputString starting from the second character

// Process each character in the modified inputString
FOR each character in inputString
    IF character is '@'
        IF counter is greater than 0 THEN
            APPEND 'at' to characterList
            SET counter = 1
        ELSE
            APPEND '@' to characterList
            SET counter = 1
    ELSE
        APPEND character to characterList

// Join the characters in characterList into a single string
SET finalOutput = JOIN characterList into a single string

// If the last character of finalOutput is '.', replace it with 'dot'
IF finalOutput's last character is '.'
    SET finalOutput = REMOVE last character + 'dot'

// Output the final processed string
PRINT finalOutput

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode
1. **Input Handling**: It starts by reading an input string and performs substitutions.
2. **Condition Checks**: It checks the first character and potentially modifies the string accordingly.
3. **Character Processing**: As it iterates through the characters, it manages the appearances of '@' to replace or prepend appropriate entries into a list.
4. **Final Adjustments**: It checks the last character for specific conditions before finalizing the output.
5. **Output**: The processed string is printed at the end. 

This format highlights the intent and structure of the code without getting bogged down by specific programming syntax.
