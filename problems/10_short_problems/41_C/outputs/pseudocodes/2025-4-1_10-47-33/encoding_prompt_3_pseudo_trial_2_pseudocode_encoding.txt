Certainly! Below is a structured and clear pseudocode representation of the provided code snippet. The pseudocode captures the intent and flow of the original logic without relying on specific programming syntax.

**Pseudocode**

1. **Read Input**  
   - Obtain a line of input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - Assign this cleaned input to a variable named `emailInput`.

2. **Replace Substrings**  
   - Replace all occurrences of the substring "dot" in `emailInput` with the character '.'.
   - Replace all occurrences of the substring "at" in `emailInput` with the character '@'.

3. **Ensure Starting Character Rule**  
   - If the first character of `emailInput` is '.', 
     - Prepend "dot" to `emailInput` (keeping the rest of the string unchanged).

4. **Initialize State Variables**  
   - Set a counter variable `previousAtCount` to 0.
   - Create an empty list `outputCharacters` to hold the processed characters.

5. **Handle the '@' Character**  
   - If the first character of `emailInput` is '@', 
     - Replace the first character with "at" (keeping the rest of the string unchanged).

6. **Process Each Character in the String**  
   - For each character `currentCharacter` in `emailInput`:
     - If `currentCharacter` is '@':
       - If `previousAtCount` is greater than 0:
         - Append the string "at" to `outputCharacters`.
         - Set `previousAtCount` to 1.
       - Else:
         - Append '@' to `outputCharacters`.
         - Set `previousAtCount` to 1.
     - Else:
       - Append `currentCharacter` to `outputCharacters`.

7. **Form the Final Output String**  
   - Join all characters in `outputCharacters` into a single string `finalOutput`.
   - If the last character of `finalOutput` is '.', 
     - Replace the last character with "dot".

8. **Display the Result**  
   - Print `finalOutput`.

This pseudocode clearly outlines the algorithm, making it easy to understand the processing of the input email-like string, the transformations applied, and how the final output is produced.
