```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    SET variable a to read a line from standard input
    REMOVE whitespace from the beginning and end of a
    REPLACE all occurrences of 'dot' in a with '.'
    REPLACE all occurrences of 'at' in a with '@'

    // Check if the first character is a dot
    IF first character of a is '.' THEN
        SET a to 'dot' concatenated with the substring of a starting from index 1
    ENDIF

    // Initialize counter and list to store characters
    SET counter co to 0
    SET empty list c
    SET length l to 0

    // Check if the first character is an at symbol
    IF first character of a is '@' THEN
        SET a to 'at' concatenated with the substring of a starting from index 1
    ENDIF

    // Iterate over each character in a
    FOR each character i in a DO
        IF i is '@' THEN
            // Check if we have seen an '@' before
            IF co > 0 THEN
                APPEND 'at' to list c
                SET co to 1
            ELSE
                APPEND '@' to list c
                SET co to 1
            ENDIF
        ELSE
            // Append the character to the list
            APPEND i to list c
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Join list c into a single string
    SET c to concatenate all elements in list c

    // Check if the last character is a dot
    IF last character of c is '.' THEN
        SET c to substring of c excluding the last character, concatenated with 'dot'
    ENDIF

    // Output the final result
    PRINT c

END PROGRAM
```

**Assumptions:**
- Input is a string that can contain the words 'dot', 'at', and other characters.
- The input string will have at least one character.
- The character replacement is case-sensitive and doesn't handle variations.
