**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to transform a given string representation of an email address by replacing specific keywords with their respective symbols, and ensuring the formatting adheres to standard email conventions.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user and remove any leading or trailing spaces.

2. **Replace Keywords:**
   - Replace each occurrence of the word "dot" with the character "."
   - Replace each occurrence of the word "at" with the character "@"

3. **Check Leading Character:**
   - If the first character of the modified string is ".", 
     - prepend the word "dot" to the string, followed by the substring starting from the second character.

4. **Initialize the List and Counter:**
   - Create a counter variable set to zero to track occurrences of "at".
   - Create an empty list to collect the processed characters.

5. **Check for Leading "at":**
   - If the modified string begins with "@",
     - prepend the word "at" to the string, followed by the substring starting from the second character.

6. **Process Each Character:**
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If the counter is greater than zero,
         - Append the word "at" to the list.
         - Set the counter to 1.
       - Otherwise, 
         - Append the character "@" to the list.
         - Set the counter to 1.
     - Otherwise,
       - Append the character to the list.

7. **Reconstruct the String:**
   - Join all elements in the list into a single string.

8. **Check for Trailing Character:**
   - If the last character of the reconstructed string is ".",
     - Replace it with the word "dot".

9. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final processed string.
