Here's the pseudocode based on the provided Python code, capturing its purpose and logic while employing clear, descriptive language:

```
FUNCTION convertInputToEmailFormat()
    // Read a line of input and remove leading and trailing whitespace
    READ inputString FROM standard input
    REPLACE occurrences of "dot" with "." IN inputString
    REPLACE occurrences of "at" with "@" IN inputString
    
    // If the first character is a dot, prepend "dot" to the string
    IF first character of inputString is '.' THEN
        SET inputString TO "dot" + remainder of inputString AFTER first character
    END IF
    
    INITIALIZE counter AS 0
    INITIALIZE conversionList AS an empty list
    INITIALIZE length AS 0

    // If the first character is an at symbol, prepend "at" to the string
    IF first character of inputString is '@' THEN
        SET inputString TO "at" + remainder of inputString AFTER first character
    END IF

    // Iterate through each character in the modified inputString
    FOR each character in inputString DO
        IF character is '@' THEN
            // Check if an '@' was already added
            IF counter > 0 THEN
                APPEND "at" to conversionList
                SET counter TO 1 // Track that we've added an '@'
            ELSE
                APPEND "@" to conversionList
                SET counter TO 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            APPEND character to conversionList
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the list into a single string
    SET convertedString TO concatenate elements of conversionList into a single string

    // If the last character of the converted string is a dot, replace it with "dot"
    IF last character of convertedString is '.' THEN
        SET convertedString TO substring of convertedString EXCLUDING last character + "dot"
    END IF

    // Output the final converted string
    PRINT convertedString
END FUNCTION
```

### Summary of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The function starts by reading a line of input and adjusting it to replace specific word patterns ("dot" with ".", "at" with "@"). It also takes care of certain edge cases involving the start and end of the string.

2. **Character Processing:** A loop processes each character. It captures special characters uniquely to ensure the correct formatting of possible email addresses.

3. **Final Adjustments:** It checks if the final character should be converted to "dot".

4. **Output Result:** Finally, it prints the fully processed email string. 

This pseudocode captures the essence of the original code while ensuring clarity and ease of understanding for readers with various programming backgrounds.
