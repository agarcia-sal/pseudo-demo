**Objective:** The primary goal of this code is to transform a string that may contain specific text representations of characters (like "dot" for "." and "at" for "@") into a standard email-like format, ensuring proper formatting rules are applied.

---

1. **Read Input:**  
   Receive a line of input from the user, which may include the strings "dot" and "at".

2. **Replace Specific Strings:**  
   - Replace every instance of the word "dot" with the character ".".
   - Replace every instance of the word "at" with the character "@".

3. **Handle Leading Character:**  
   - If the first character of the adjusted string is ".", prepend "dot" to the string (to ensure it does not start with a dot).

4. **Initialize Variables:**  
   - Create a counter to track occurrences of "@".
   - Create an empty list to build the final output string.
   - Initialize a variable to hold the total length of the string, although it's not actively used in further calculations.

5. **Correct Leading "at":**  
   - If the first character of the string is "@", change it so that the string begins with "at" followed by the rest of the characters.

6. **Process Each Character:**  
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If there has already been an occurrence of "@" prior to this, append "at" to the list.
       - If it is the first "@" being processed, append "@" directly to the list.
     - If the character is not "@", append it to the list as is.

7. **Form Final Output String:**  
   - Join all elements in the list to form a single string.

8. **Replace Trailing Character:**  
   - If the last character of this new string is ".", replace it with "dot".

9. **Display Result:**  
   - Print the final modified string.

### Pseudocode:

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Read input from user
    SET input_string = Read user input from stdin
    TRIM input_string of leading/trailing spaces

    // Step 2: Replace "dot" and "at" with their symbols
    REPLACE "dot" in input_string with "."
    REPLACE "at" in input_string with "@"

    // Step 3: Handle leading character case
    IF input_string starts with "." THEN
        PREPEND "dot" to input_string

    // Step 4: Initialize variables
    SET occurrences_of_at = 0
    CREATE an empty list called final_output
    Initialize length_of_string variable (not used in processing)

    // Step 5: Correct leading "at"
    IF input_string starts with "@" THEN
        REPLACE first character with "at" + rest of the string

    // Step 6: Process each character of the modified string
    FOR EACH character IN input_string DO
        IF character is "@" THEN
            IF occurrences_of_at > 0 THEN
                APPEND "at" to final_output
                SET occurrences_of_at = 1 
            ELSE
                APPEND "@" to final_output
                SET occurrences_of_at = 1
        ELSE
            APPEND character to final_output

    // Step 7: Create final output string
    SET final_string = JOIN elements in final_output into a single string

    // Step 8: Replace trailing dot, if applicable
    IF final_string ends with "." THEN
        REPLACE last character with "dot"

    // Step 9: Output the result
    PRINT final_string
END
```

This pseudocode captures the logic of the original code while ensuring clarity and accessibility for those unfamiliar with programming syntax.
