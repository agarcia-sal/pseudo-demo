**Pseudocode for the Given Code:**

1. **Start** 
2. **Read Input**: 
   - Read a line of input from the user and remove any leading or trailing spaces. 
   - Assign this input to a variable called `userInput`.

3. **Replace Substrings**:
   - Replace every occurrence of the substring "dot" in `userInput` with the character ".".
   - Replace every occurrence of the substring "at" in `userInput` with the character "@".

4. **Check Beginning Character**: 
   - If the first character of `userInput` is a dot ("."):
     - Prepend the substring "dot" to `userInput` (removing the leading dot).

5. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set a counter `counter` to 0.
   - Create an empty list `charList` to hold processed characters.
   - Initialize a variable `length` to 0 (this variable is not utilized, hence it can be ignored in some interpretations).

6. **Check for Starting Character**:
   - If the first character of `userInput` is an at symbol ("@"):
     - Prepend the substring "at" to `userInput` (removing the leading at symbol).

7. **Process Each Character**: 
   - For each character `currentChar` in `userInput`:
     - If `currentChar` is an "@" symbol:
       - If `counter` is greater than 0:
         - Append the substring "at" to `charList`.
         - Set `counter` to 1.
       - Otherwise:
         - Append the "@" character to `charList`.
         - Set `counter` to 1.
     - Otherwise:
       - Append `currentChar` to `charList`.

8. **Join Characters**: 
   - Create a new string `finalResult` by joining the elements of `charList` into a single string.

9. **Check Ending Character**:
   - If the last character of `finalResult` is a dot ("."):
     - Remove the last character and append the substring "dot" to `finalResult`.

10. **Output Result**: 
    - Print the `finalResult`.

11. **End**
