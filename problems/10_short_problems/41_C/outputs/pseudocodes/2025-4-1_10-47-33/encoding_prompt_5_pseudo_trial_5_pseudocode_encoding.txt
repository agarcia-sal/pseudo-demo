**Purpose of the Code:**
The primary goal of this code is to transform a string input by replacing specific text patterns with designated symbols and ensuring the output adheres to email formatting rules.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Read input from the standard input
    INPUT string from user and remove trailing spaces
    SET originalString = inputString

    // Replace occurrences in the string
    REPLACE occurrences of "dot" with "." in originalString
    REPLACE occurrences of "at" with "@" in originalString

    // Check if the first character is a dot
    IF originalString starts with "." THEN
        ADD "dot" at the beginning of originalString

    // Initialize variables to manage email formatting
    SET previousChar as 0    // To track the last occurrence of '@'
    CREATE an empty list called formattedCharacters
    SET lengthToLastChar as 0 // To hold the length of the formatted string

    // Check if the string starts with an '@'
    IF originalString starts with "@" THEN
        ADD "at" to the beginning of originalString

    // Iterate through each character in the modified string
    FOR each character in originalString DO
        // Check if the character is an '@'
        IF character is "@" THEN
            IF previousChar > 0 THEN
                ADD "at" to formattedCharacters list
                SET previousChar = 1  // Update to indicate '@' was found
            ELSE
                ADD "@" to formattedCharacters list
                SET previousChar = 1  // Update to indicate '@' was found
        ELSE
            ADD character to formattedCharacters list
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Join the formatted characters into a single string
    SET finalString = join all characters in formattedCharacters list

    // Check if the last character of the formatted string is a dot
    IF finalString ends with "." THEN
        REMOVE the last character and ADD "dot" to finalString

    // Print the final formatted string
    OUTPUT finalString

END PROGRAM
```

**Explanations and Comments:**

1. **Input Handling:** The program reads an entire line of input and removes unnecessary whitespace.
  
2. **String Replacement:** It systematically replaces textual representations of symbols ('dot' with '.' and 'at' with '@').

3. **Email Formatting Rules:** The program ensures that if the string starts or ends in a specific way, it adjusts the output to maintain a proper email format.

4. **Character Processing:** While iterating through each character, the program handles the special characters '@' separately to avoid duplicate entries, ensuring that "at" only appears correctly once.

5. **Final Adjustments:** The program checks again before outputting the final result to ensure no trailing dots, reinforcing the proper structure for an email-like string.

This pseudocode serves as a clear and simplified version of the original code, making it accessible and understandable for those unfamiliar with programming syntax.
