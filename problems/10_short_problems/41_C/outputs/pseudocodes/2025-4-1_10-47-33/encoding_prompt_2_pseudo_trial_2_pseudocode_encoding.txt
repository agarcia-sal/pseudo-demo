**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
   
2. **Replace Specific Strings:**
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" in the input with the character "." (dot).
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "at" in the input with the character "@" (at).

3. **Check Beginning of String:**
   - If the first character of the modified string is a ".", prepend the string "dot" to the remaining characters.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter for "at" occurrences to zero.
   - Create an empty list to collect characters.
   - Initialize a character index to zero.

5. **Handle Starting Character:**
   - If the first character of the string is "@", replace it with "at" followed by the rest of the string characters.

6. **Iterate Through Characters:**
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If there has been an "at" occurrence before (counter > 0):
         - Append the string "at" to the list of collected characters.
       - If it is the first occurrence of "@" (counter is 0):
         - Append the character "@" to the list.
       - Increment the counter for "at" occurrences.
     - If the character is not "@":
       - Append the character to the list of collected characters.

7. **Combine Collected Characters:**
   - Join all characters in the list into a single string.

8. **Final Adjustment:**
   - If the last character of the combined string is ".":
     - Replace the last character with "dot".

9. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final modified string.
