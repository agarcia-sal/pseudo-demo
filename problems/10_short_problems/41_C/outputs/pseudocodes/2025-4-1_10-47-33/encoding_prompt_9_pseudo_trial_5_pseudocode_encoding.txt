**Purpose:** 
The goal of this program is to transform a specific input string by replacing certain keywords with symbols and modifying the string based on certain conditions, primarily focused on formatting email addresses.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user and remove any leading or trailing spaces.

2. **Replace Keywords:**
   - Replace every occurrence of the word "dot" with the symbol "." in the input string.
   - Replace every occurrence of the word "at" with the symbol "@" in the input string.

3. **Check for Leading Symbols:**
   - If the first character of the modified string is ".", prepend the string with "dot".

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter for occurrences of "@" to 0.
   - Create an empty list to hold characters.
   - Initialize a length variable to 0.

5. **Check for Leading "at":**
   - If the first character of the modified string is "@", prepend the string with "at".

6. **Process Each Character:**
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If the counter is greater than 0 (indicating another "@" has already been encountered):
          - Append "at" to the list of characters.
          - Set the counter to 1.
       - Otherwise:
          - Append "@" to the list of characters.
          - Set the counter to 1.
     - Otherwise (the character is not "@"):
       - Append the character directly to the list.

7. **Join Characters:**
   - Combine all characters in the list into a single string.

8. **Check Trailing Symbols:**
   - If the last character of the newly formed string is ".", replace it with "dot".

9. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final transformed string.
