```
Begin program

1. Read input string from standard input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
2. Replace all occurrences of the substring "dot" with the character "." in the input string.
3. Replace all occurrences of the substring "at" with the character "@" in the updated string.

4. If the first character of the modified string is a ".", 
   then prepend the substring "dot" to the string, excluding the first character.

5. Initialize a counter "co" to track the number of consecutive "@" found.
6. Initialize an empty list "c" to hold processed characters.
7. Initialize a variable "l" to 0 (though it is not used further in the logic).

8. If the first character of the modified string is "@",
   then prepend the substring "at" to the string, excluding the first character.

9. For each character "i" in the modified string:
   a. If the character "i" is an "@":
      i. If "co" is greater than 0 (meaning "@" has been seen already):
         - Append the substring "at" to the list "c".
         - Set "co" to 1.
      ii. Otherwise:
         - Append the character "@" to the list "c".
         - Set "co" to 1.
   b. Else:
      - Append the character "i" to the list "c".

10. Join all characters in the list "c" into a single string.

11. If the last character of the final string "c" is a ".",
    then replace the last character with the substring "dot".

12. Print the final processed string "c".

End program
