1. Begin by reading a line of input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
2. Replace every occurrence of the word "dot" with a period (.) in the input string.
3. Replace every occurrence of the word "at" with an at symbol (@) in the modified input string.
4. Check if the first character of the modified string is a period:
   - If it is, prepend the word "dot" to the string, excluding the first character.
5. Initialize a counter for occurrences of the at symbol and an empty list to hold characters.
6. Initialize a variable for the current position.
7. Check if the first character of the string is an at symbol:
   - If it is, prepend the word "at" to the string, excluding the first character.
8. For each character in the modified string:
   - If the character is an at symbol:
     - If the counter for occurrences of the at symbol is greater than zero, append the word "at" to the list and set the counter to one.
     - Otherwise, append the at symbol to the list and set the counter to one.
   - If the character is not an at symbol, simply append it to the list.
9. Join all elements in the list to form a single string.
10. Check if the last character of the joined string is a period:
    - If it is, replace the last character with the word "dot".
11. Finally, output the modified string.
