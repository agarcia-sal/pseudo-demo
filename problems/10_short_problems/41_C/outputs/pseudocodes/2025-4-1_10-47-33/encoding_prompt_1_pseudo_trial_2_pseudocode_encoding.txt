**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user and store it in a variable called `userInput`.
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from `userInput`.

2. **Replace Substrings:**
   - Replace all occurrences of the substring "dot" in `userInput` with the character ".".
   - Replace all occurrences of the substring "at" in `userInput` with the character "@".

3. **Adjust Starting Character:**
   - If the first character of `userInput` is ".", prepend "dot" to it (so it becomes "dot" followed by the rest of the string).

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter `atCounter` to 0.
   - Create an empty list `convertedCharacters` to hold the processed characters.
   - Set the variable `length` to 0 (though `length` is unused in this pseudocode).

5. **Handle @ Character:**
   - If the first character of `userInput` is "@", change it so that it starts with "at" (replace "@" with "at" followed by the rest of the string).

6. **Process Each Character:**
   - For each character `currentChar` in `userInput`:
     - If `currentChar` is "@":
       - If `atCounter` is greater than 0 (meaning "@" has been seen before):
         - Append "at" to `convertedCharacters`.
         - Set `atCounter` to 1;
       - Otherwise:
         - Append "@" to `convertedCharacters`.
         - Set `atCounter` to 1.
     - If `currentChar` is not "@":
       - Append `currentChar` to `convertedCharacters`.

7. **Combine Converted Characters:**
   - Join all elements in `convertedCharacters` into a single string and store it in a variable called `result`.

8. **Final Adjustments:**
   - If the last character of `result` is ".", replace it with "dot".

9. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the string `result`.
