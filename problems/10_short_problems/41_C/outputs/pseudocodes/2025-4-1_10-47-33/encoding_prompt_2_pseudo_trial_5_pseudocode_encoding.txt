**Pseudocode Explanation:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Obtain a line of text from standard input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Replace Substrings:**
   - Replace every occurrence of the substring "dot" with a period ('.').
   - Replace every occurrence of the substring "at" with the character '@'.

3. **Adjust Beginning Character:**
   - If the modified text starts with a period ('.'), change the beginning of the text to "dot" followed by the rest of the text.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a counter variable to track occurrences of the '@' character (initialize to zero).
   - Create an empty list to collect characters of the final output.
   - Set a variable for tracking the length of the text (initialize to zero).

5. **Handle Leading '@':**
   - If the modified text starts with '@', change the start of the text to "at" followed by the rest of the text.

6. **Iterate Over Each Character:**
   - For each character in the modified text:
     - If the character is '@':
       - If the counter indicates that this is not the first '@' found:
         - Append "at" to the list.
         - Update the counter to indicate another '@' has been processed.
       - If this is the first '@':
         - Append the character '@' to the list.
         - Update the counter accordingly.
     - If the character is not '@', append it directly to the list.

7. **Join Characters:**
   - Combine all characters collected in the list into a single string.

8. **Final Adjustment:**
   - If the last character of the combined string is a period ('.'):
     - Remove the period and replace it with "dot".

9. **Output Result:**
   - Display the final modified string.
