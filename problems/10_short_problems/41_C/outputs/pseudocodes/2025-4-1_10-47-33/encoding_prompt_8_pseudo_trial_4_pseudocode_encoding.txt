**Purpose Summary**: The primary goal of this program is to convert a string representing an email address from a less conventional format (where specific characters are represented by words, such as "dot" for "." and "at" for "@") back into a standard format. Additionally, it manages leading and trailing conditions for these special characters.

---

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Read Input**:
   - Get a line of input from the user and remove any extra spaces around it.
  
2. **Replace Specific Words**:
   - Replace every occurrence of "dot" in the input string with a period (".").
   - Replace every occurrence of "at" in the input string with an at-symbol ("@").

3. **Handle Leading Period**:
   - If the first character of the modified string is a period ("."):
     - Prepend the string with "dot", replacing the first character's period.

4. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set a counter to track occurrences of the at-symbol ("@") as zero.
   - Initialize an empty list to hold characters of the processed string.
  
5. **Handle Leading At-Symbol**:
   - If the modified string starts with an at-symbol ("@"):
     - Replace the at-symbol with "at", keeping the rest of the string unchanged.

6. **Process Each Character**:
   - For every character in the modified string:
     - If the character is an at-symbol ("@"):
       - If the counter for at-symbols is greater than zero:
         - Append "at" to the list instead of another at-symbol.
         - Reset the counter to one (indicating an at-symbol has been processed).
       - Else:
         - Append the at-symbol to the list.
         - Set the counter to one.
     - Else:
       - Append the character to the list.

7. **Join Characters Together**:
   - Combine all the characters in the list into a single string.

8. **Handle Trailing Period**:
   - If the last character of the resulting string is a period ("."):
     - Remove the period and replace it with "dot".

9. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the final processed string.

**Example**:

- **Input**: "dotcomatdot"
- **Output**: "com@dot"

This pseudocode captures the essence of the original code functionality in a clear and straightforward manner, making it accessible to individuals without programming expertise.
