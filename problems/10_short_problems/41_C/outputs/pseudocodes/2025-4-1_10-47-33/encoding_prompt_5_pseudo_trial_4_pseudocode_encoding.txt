**Purpose:** The code processes an email-like string to replace certain keywords with symbols, ensuring it conforms to a specific format before outputting the final string.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN ProcessEmailString

    // Read input from the user
    SET inputString TO Read input from the standard input and remove leading/trailing spaces
    
    // Replace specific words with symbols
    REPLACE all occurrences of the word "dot" with a period (.)
    REPLACE all occurrences of the word "at" with the symbol (@)

    // If the string starts with a period, prepend "dot"
    IF inputString starts with '.' THEN
        PREPEND "dot" to inputString (excluding the first character)

    // Initialize variables for tracking and modification
    SET countAtSymbol TO 0
    INITIALIZE an empty list called modifiedCharacters
    SET lengthOfString TO 0

    // If the string starts with "@", prepend "at"
    IF inputString starts with '@' THEN
        PREPEND "at" to inputString (excluding the first character)

    // Loop through each character in the modified input string
    FOR EACH character IN inputString DO

        // Check if the character is the "at" symbol
        IF character IS '@' THEN
            
            // If an "at" symbol has been added before
            IF countAtSymbol IS greater than 0 THEN
                APPEND the word "at" to modifiedCharacters
                SET countAtSymbol TO 1  // Reset count
            
            // If this is the first "at" symbol
            ELSE 
                APPEND the "at" symbol to modifiedCharacters
                SET countAtSymbol TO 1  // Update count

        ELSE 
            // If character is not "at", append it to the list
            APPEND character to modifiedCharacters

    // Join the modified characters into a single string
    SET finalString TO Join all characters in modifiedCharacters into a single string

    // If the final string ends with a period, replace it with "dot"
    IF finalString ends with '.' THEN
        REMOVE the last character and APPEND "dot" to finalString

    // Output the final processed string
    PRINT finalString

END ProcessEmailString
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The initial replacements set the stage for a proper email format by converting keywords to symbols.
- The logic ensures that the structure of the email-like string is maintained, with special handling for cases when the string starts with specific characters.
- The process of handling repeated "at" symbols prevents duplicated representations. 
- The final check and modification safeguard against outputting a terminating period, which is replaced correctly with "dot". 

This pseudocode effectively outlines the key operations while remaining accessible to readers unfamiliar with programming syntax.
