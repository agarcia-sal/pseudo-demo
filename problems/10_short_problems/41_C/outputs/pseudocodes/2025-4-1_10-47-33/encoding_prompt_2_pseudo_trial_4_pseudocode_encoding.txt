1. Begin by reading a line of input, which is a string that may contain specific words to replace.
2. Remove any leading or trailing spaces from the input string.
3. Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" with a period (".").
4. Replace all occurrences of the word "at" with the symbol ("@").
5. Check if the first character of the modified string is a period:
   - If it is, add the word "dot" at the beginning of the string and keep the rest unchanged.
6. Initialize a counter for occurrences of the "@" symbol and create an empty list to store characters.
7. Initialize a variable to track the length of the string, though it will not be actively used further in the process.
8. Check if the first character of the current string is an "@" symbol:
   - If it is, replace it with the word "at" at the beginning of the string, while keeping the rest unchanged.
9. For each character in the modified string:
   - If the character is "@":
     - If a "@" has already been added previously (counter greater than zero), append the word "at" to the list.
     - Otherwise, append the "@" character to the list and update the counter to indicate that "@" has been added.
   - If the character is not "@":
     - Append the character to the list.
10. Join all characters in the list into a single string to form the final result.
11. Check if the last character of the final string is a period:
    - If it is, replace the period with the word "dot" while keeping the rest of the string unchanged.
12. Output the final modified string.
