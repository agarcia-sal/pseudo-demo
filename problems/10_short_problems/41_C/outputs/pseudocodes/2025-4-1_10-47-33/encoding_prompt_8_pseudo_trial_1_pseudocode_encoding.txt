**Objective:** The primary goal of this code is to process a string representing an email address, replacing specific terms with symbols used in standard email formatting, and ensuring that the resultant format adheres to certain rules.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input**: 
   - Get the input string from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Replace Terms**: 
   - Replace every occurrence of the term "dot" with the character "." in the input string.
   - Replace every occurrence of the term "at" with the character "@" in the input string.

3. **Handle Leading Character**: 
   - If the first character of the modified string is a ".", then:
       - Prepend "dot" to the string, removing the first character.

4. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set a counter (`countAt`) to track the number of "@" symbols processed.
   - Create an empty list (`outputList`) to build the final output string.
   
5. **Check Leading Character for "at"**:
   - If the first character of the string is "@", then:
       - Change the first character to "at".

6. **Process Each Character**: 
   - For each character in the modified string:
       - If the character is "@":
           - If `countAt` is greater than 0, append "at" to the `outputList` and set `countAt` to 1.
           - Otherwise, append "@" to the `outputList` and set `countAt` to 1.
       - If the character is not "@", append the character to the `outputList`.

7. **Join and Finalize Output**: 
   - Join all elements in `outputList` into a single string (`finalString`).
   - If the last character of `finalString` is ".", then:
       - Replace the last character with "dot".

8. **Print Output**: 
   - Display the modified string (`finalString`) to the user.

**Example**: 

- Input: "dotdavidatxyz.dot"
- Intermediate Steps:
  - After replacements: "david@xyz."
  - After checking leading character: "david@xyz."
  - Process each character: "davidatxyz"
  - Final adjustment: "davidatxyzdot"
- Output: "davidatxyzdot"

**Comments**: 
- Be aware that multiple "@" symbols are condensed into "at".
- The output is formatted to ensure that there are no leading or trailing invalid characters.
