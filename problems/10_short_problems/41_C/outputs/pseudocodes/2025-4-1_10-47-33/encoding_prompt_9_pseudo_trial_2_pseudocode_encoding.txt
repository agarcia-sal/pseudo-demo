**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this algorithm is to process a given string containing special text representations ("dot" for periods and "at" for the @ symbol) and convert them into their actual characters, ensuring proper formatting based on specific rules.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of text from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Replace Text Representations:**
   - Replace all occurrences of "dot" in the string with "." (period).
   - Replace all occurrences of "at" in the string with "@" (at symbol).

3. **Check and Adjust Starting Character:**
   - If the first character of the string is a ".", prepend "dot" to the string (the first character is replaced with "dot").

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter `count` to track occurrences of "at".
   - Create an empty list `characters` to store the processed characters.

5. **Check for '@' Symbol at Start:**
   - If the first character of the string is "@", prepend "at" to the string (the first character is replaced with "at").

6. **Process Each Character in the String:**
   - For each character `currentCharacter` in the string:
     - If `currentCharacter` is "@":
       - If `count` is greater than 0:
         - Add "at" to `characters` list.
         - Set `count` back to 1 (indicating that the current "at" representation has been handled).
       - Else:
         - Add "@" to the `characters` list.
         - Set `count` to 1. 
     - Else:
       - Add `currentCharacter` to the `characters` list.

7. **Join Processed Characters:**
   - Combine all characters in the `characters` list into a single string `finalString`.

8. **Handle Trailing Periods:**
   - If the last character of `finalString` is a "." (period):
     - Replace the last "." with "dot".

9. **Output the Final String:**
   - Print the `finalString` as the result.

**Summary of Input and Output:**
- **Input:** A string that may contain "dot" and "at" as placeholders.
- **Output:** A transformed string with the proper characters representing the original placeholders, following the specified rules.
