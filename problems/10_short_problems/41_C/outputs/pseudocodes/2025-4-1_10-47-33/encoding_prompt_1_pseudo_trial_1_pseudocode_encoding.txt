**Pseudocode**

```
BEGIN

    // Read input from user and remove unnecessary whitespace
    INPUT string from user as inputString
    REPLACE all occurrences of "dot" with "." in inputString
    REPLACE all occurrences of "at" with "@" in inputString

    // Check if the input starts with a dot and modify accordingly
    IF the first character of inputString is "."
        SET inputString to "dot" + the substring of inputString starting from the second character
    END IF

    // Initialize a counter and an empty list for constructing the output
    SET counter to 0
    SET characterList to an empty list
    SET length of characterList to 0

    // Check if the input starts with an @ and modify accordingly
    IF the first character of inputString is "@"
        SET inputString to "at" + the substring of inputString starting from the second character
    END IF

    // Iterate through each character in the input string
    FOR each character in inputString DO

        // Check for the occurrence of '@' character
        IF the character is "@" THEN
            IF counter is greater than 0 THEN
                // Append "at" to characterList if we already encountered an '@'
                ADD "at" to characterList
                SET counter to 1 
            ELSE
                // Append "@" to characterList for the first occurrence
                ADD "@" to characterList
                SET counter to 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            // If the character is not '@', simply add it to characterList
            ADD the character to characterList
        END IF

    END FOR

    // Join all characters in characterList into a single string
    SET outputString to the concatenation of all elements in characterList

    // Check if the final character is a dot and modify accordingly
    IF the last character of outputString is "." THEN
        SET outputString to the substring of outputString excluding the last character + "dot"
    END IF

    // Print the final output
    PRINT outputString

END
``` 

This pseudocode captures the main logic and flow of the provided code, focusing on the transformation of the input string and handling special cases for "dot" and "at".
