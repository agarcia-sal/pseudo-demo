**Purpose Summary**:  
The primary goal of this code is to transform a string by replacing certain keywords ("dot" and "at") with their respective symbols ('.' and '@'), while also ensuring that the formatted string adheres to specific rules regarding the placement of these symbols.

**Pseudocode**:

```
BEGIN

  // Read input from the user
  READ inputString
  
  // Replace occurrences of 'dot' with '.'
  REPLACE 'dot' in inputString WITH '.'
  
  // Replace occurrences of 'at' with '@'
  REPLACE 'at' in inputString WITH '@'
  
  // If the first character is '.', prepend 'dot'
  IF inputString starts with '.' THEN
    SET inputString TO 'dot' + inputString starting from the second character
  
  // Initialize a counter for '@' symbols and a list for building the output
  SET atCounter TO 0
  SET outputList TO an empty list

  // If the first character is '@', prepend 'at'
  IF inputString starts with '@' THEN
    SET inputString TO 'at' + inputString starting from the second character

  // Iterate through each character in the updated inputString
  FOR each character in inputString DO
    
    // Check if the character is '@'
    IF character is '@' THEN
      
      // If '@' has already been added once, replace it with 'at'
      IF atCounter > 0 THEN
        ADD 'at' to outputList
        SET atCounter TO 1 // Mark '@' has been added again
      ELSE 
        ADD '@' to outputList
        SET atCounter TO 1 // Mark first '@' has been added
    
    ELSE
      // For other characters, add them directly to the outputList
      ADD character to outputList
  
  // Join the list of characters into a single string
  SET finalOutput TO join all characters in outputList into a single string
  
  // If the last character is '.', replace it with 'dot'
  IF finalOutput ends with '.' THEN
    SET finalOutput TO finalOutput removing the last character + 'dot'
  
  // Print the final transformed output
  PRINT finalOutput

END
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The program starts by reading an input string, where dot and at keywords are replaced by their symbolic representations.
- It prevents leading symbols from impacting the output by effectively prepending terms when necessary.
- The program keeps track of how many times the '@' character is added to ensure correct formatting in the final output. 
- Finally, it handles a special case of a trailing '.' by converting it back to 'dot'. 

This pseudocode retains the logic of the original code while expressing it in clear and accessible terms, suitable for readers with little or no programming background.
