**Purpose:**
The goal of this algorithm is to transform an email-like string by replacing specific text patterns with appropriate symbols and ensuring the format adheres to email conventions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of text input and remove any surrounding whitespace.

2. **Replace Text Patterns:**
   - Replace all instances of "dot" in the string with the character ".".
   - Replace all instances of "at" in the string with the character "@".

3. **Adjust Leading Character:**
   - If the first character of the modified string is ".", change the string by prepending "dot".

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter to track occurrences of "@".
   - Create an empty list to store characters.
   - Initialize a variable to hold the length of the string (if needed).

5. **Check for Leading "at":**
   - If the first character of the string is "@", change the string by prepending "at".

6. **Iterate Through Each Character:**
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is "@":
       - If the counter is greater than 0:
         - Append the string "at" to the list.
         - Set the counter to 1.
       - Otherwise:
         - Append the character "@" to the list.
         - Set the counter to 1.
     - If the character is not "@":
       - Append the character to the list.

7. **Reconstruct the String:**
   - Join all the characters in the list to form a new string.

8. **Adjust Trailing Character:**
   - If the last character of the new string is ".", replace it with "dot".

9. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final transformed string.

This pseudocode provides a clear step-by-step representation of the original code's logic, making it easier to understand without relying on specific programming syntax.
