**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to convert a specific text input that uses the words "dot" and "at" into a more standard email-like format using the symbols "." and "@".

---

### Pseudocode

1. **Read Input:**
   - Accept a line of text from the user.
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.

2. **Replace Keywords:**
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" with the symbol ".".
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "at" with the symbol "@".

3. **Check for Leading Dot:**
   - If the first character of the modified string is a ".", prepend the word "dot" to the string.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter (`co`) to track the appearances of the "@" symbol.
   - Create an empty list (`c`) to store processed characters.
   - Initialize a variable (`l`) to zero (this variable seems unused, possibly for future logic).

5. **Fix the Leading At:**
   - If the first character of the modified string is "@", prepend the word "at" to the string.

6. **Process Each Character:**
   - For each character in the modified string:
     - If the character is an "@" symbol:
       - Check if the counter (`co`) is greater than zero:
         - If true, append the word "at" to the list (`c`).
         - Reset the counter to 1.
       - If false, append the "@" symbol to the list (`c`) and set the counter to 1.
     - If the character is not "@", append the character to the list (`c`).

7. **Combine Characters:**
   - Combine all elements in the list (`c`) into a single string.

8. **Adjust Trailing Dot:**
   - If the last character of the combined string is a ".", replace it with the word "dot".

9. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final modified string.

### Example Usage Scenario:
- Input: "example dot com at user"
- Process:
  - Replace "dot" with "." => "example . com at user"
  - Since there is no leading dot, it remains the same.
  - Leading "at" is evaluated, but there is no modification.
  - Process each character, replacing "at" appropriately.
  - Final output is "example.com@user".

### Comments for Clarity:
- This pseudocode aims to ensure the input string is formatted like an email address, handling special words for dots and at symbols appropriately while safeguarding against common formatting issues, such as leading or trailing characters.
