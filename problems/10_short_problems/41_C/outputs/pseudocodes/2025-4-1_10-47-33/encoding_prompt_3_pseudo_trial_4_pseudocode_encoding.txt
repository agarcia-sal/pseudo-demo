### Explanation:
1. **Inputs and Outputs:** The pseudocode begins with reading input and clearly shows the processing of the input string, illustrating how the output is derived.
   
2. **Replace Operations:** The specific word replacements are accurately captured to clarify the transformation of the input string.

3. **Control Structures:** For loops and conditional branches are well represented, facilitating an understanding of the processing logic.

4. **Use of Descriptive Names:** Variable names like `inputString`, `characterList`, and `processedString` provide clarity on their roles within the algorithm. 

5. **Logical Flow:** The structure of the pseudocode maintains a clear flow of operations, maintaining coherence and readability. 

Overall, this pseudocode serves as a high-level representation of the underlying code logic, making it accessible for someone unfamiliar with the original syntax.
