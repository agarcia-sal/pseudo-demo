Here's the high-level pseudocode that reflects the operations and logic of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION processInput()
    // Read input from standard input
    DECLARE inputString AS STRING
    inputString = readLine().strip()

    // Replace occurrences of 'dot' with '.' and 'at' with '@'
    inputString = replaceString(inputString, 'dot', '.')
    inputString = replaceString(inputString, 'at', '@')

    // If the first character is a dot, prefix the string with 'dot'
    IF firstCharacterIsDot(inputString) THEN
        inputString = 'dot' + substring(inputString, 1)

    // Initialize variables for further processing
    DECLARE countAt AS INTEGER
    countAt = 0
    DECLARE updatedCharacters AS LIST
    updatedCharacters = emptyList()
    
    // Check for leading '@' character and prefix with 'at' if present
    IF firstCharacterIsAt(inputString) THEN
        inputString = 'at' + substring(inputString, 1)

    // Iterate through each character in the input string
    FOR each character IN inputString DO
        IF character IS '@' THEN
            // Check if we have already appended one '@'
            IF countAt > 0 THEN
                updatedCharacters.append('at')
                countAt = 1 // Update to indicate we've seen an '@'
            ELSE
                updatedCharacters.append('@')
                countAt = 1 // Update to note we've added an '@' already
            END IF
        ELSE
            updatedCharacters.append(character)
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Combine the updated character list back into a string
    DECLARE finalString AS STRING
    finalString = join(updatedCharacters)

    // If the final string ends with a dot, replace it with 'dot'
    IF lastCharacterIsDot(finalString) THEN
        finalString = substring(finalString, 0, length(finalString) - 1) + 'dot'
    END IF

    // Print the final processed string
    print(finalString)
END FUNCTION
```

### Breakdown of the Pseudocode:
1. **Initialization:** The function starts by reading and preparing the input string.
2. **String Replacements:** It replaces occurrences of 'dot' and 'at' as specified.
3. **Character Handling:** It checks for specific patterns (like leading characters) and maintains a count of '@' characters.
4. **Loop Structure:** A loop processes each character, deciding how to append it based on conditions.
5. **Final Adjustments:** At the end, it modifies the string again based on the final character.
6. **Output:** Finally, it outputs the processed string.

### Input and Output:
- **Input:** A string with possible occurrences of 'dot' and 'at' in specific formats.
- **Output:** A modified string that has replaced and handled these occurrences as described.
