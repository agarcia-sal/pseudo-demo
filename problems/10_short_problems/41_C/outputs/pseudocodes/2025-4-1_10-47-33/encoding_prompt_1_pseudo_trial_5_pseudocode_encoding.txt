**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Read a line of text from standard input and store it in a variable called `inputString`.
   
2. **Replace Keywords:**
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" with the character "." in `inputString`.
   - Replace all occurrences of the word "at" with the character "@" in `inputString`.

3. **Handle Special Case for Initial Character:**
   - If the first character of `inputString` is ".", prepend the word "dot" to the string (i.e., replace the first character with "dot" followed by the remainder of the string).

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a counter called `atCount` set to 0 to track occurrences of "@".
   - Create an empty list called `resultList` to collect characters and strings during processing.
   
5. **Handle Special Case for Email Format:**
   - If `inputString` starts with "@", modify it such that the first character becomes "at".

6. **Process Each Character:**
   - For each character `currentChar` in `inputString`:
     - If `currentChar` is "@":
       - If `atCount` is greater than 0:
         - Append the string "at" to `resultList` (indicating that we encountered another "@" symbol).
         - Set `atCount` to 1.
       - Else:
         - Append the character "@" to `resultList` (indicating the first occurrence).
         - Set `atCount` to 1.
     - Else:
       - Append `currentChar` to `resultList`.

7. **Combine Results:**
   - Join all elements in `resultList` to form a single string called `outputString`.

8. **Handle Ending Special Case:**
   - If the last character of `outputString` is ".", replace it with the word "dot".

9. **Output Result:**
   - Print the final `outputString`. 

This pseudocode summarizes the logic flow and the transformations applied to the input string based on specific rules regarding "dot" and "at" while managing special cases for formatting.
