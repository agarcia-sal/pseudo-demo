Here is the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION processInputAddress()
    // Read input string from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace
    INITIALIZE inputAddress as read from standard input and trimmed

    // Replace occurrences of specific words with symbols
    REPLACE 'dot' with '.' in inputAddress
    REPLACE 'at' with '@' in inputAddress

    // Ensure the address starts with a valid prefix if it begins with a dot
    IF the first character of inputAddress is '.' THEN
        CONCATENATE 'dot' to the front of inputAddress (excluding the dot)

    // Initialize a counter for occurrences of '@' and a list for building the output
    INITIALIZE occurrenceCounter to 0
    INITIALIZE outputList as an empty list

    // Process the input address
    // If the address starts with '@', prefix it with 'at'
    IF the first character of inputAddress is '@' THEN
        CONCATENATE 'at' to the front of inputAddress (excluding the at)

    // Loop through each character in the processed input address
    FOR each character in inputAddress DO
        IF the character is '@' THEN
            IF occurrenceCounter is greater than 0 THEN
                APPEND 'at' to outputList
                SET occurrenceCounter to 1
            ELSE
                APPEND '@' to outputList
                SET occurrenceCounter to 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            APPEND character to outputList
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the list of characters into a single string
    SET finalAddress as the concatenation of elements in outputList

    // If the final character of the address is '.', replace it with 'dot'
    IF the last character of finalAddress is '.' THEN
        REPLACE last character with 'dot' in finalAddress
    END IF

    // Output the final processed address
    PRINT finalAddress
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts with reading and cleaning the input to ensure it is ready for processing.
2. **String Replacement:** It replaces specified strings according to the rules defined in the original code.
3. **Prefix Adjustment:** It checks and modifies the start of the string based on certain conditions.
4. **Character Processing:** It loops through the string characters and builds the output based on the presence of the '@' symbol while managing occurrences.
5. **Final Character Adjustment:** It checks and adjusts the final character of the output as needed.
6. **Output:** Finally, it prints the processed address, achieving the goal of transforming email-like strings. 

This format should make it easy for readers to understand the code's logic without getting bogged down by programming syntax.
