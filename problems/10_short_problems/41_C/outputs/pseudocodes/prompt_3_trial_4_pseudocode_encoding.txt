Here's the pseudocode that represents the core logic of the provided code snippet. The pseudocode focuses on the intent and structure rather than the syntax of a specific programming language.

```
BEGIN

    // Read input from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace
    SET inputString TO read input from standard input
    REMOVE whitespace from inputString

    // Replace occurrences of substrings
    REPLACE "dot" with "." in inputString
    REPLACE "at" with "@" in inputString

    // If the string starts with a ".", prepend "dot" to the string
    IF inputString starts with "." THEN
        SET inputString TO "dot" followed by inputString without the first character

    // Initialize variables for processing
    SET countAtSymbols TO 0
    INITIALIZE list for character storage AS empty list
    SET lengthIndicator TO 0

    // If the string starts with "@", prepend "at" to the string
    IF inputString starts with "@" THEN
        SET inputString TO "at" followed by inputString without the first character

    // Process each character in the inputString
    FOR each character in inputString DO
        IF character is "@" THEN
            IF countAtSymbols > 0 THEN
                APPEND "at" to character storage list
                SET countAtSymbols TO 1
            ELSE
                APPEND "@" to character storage list
                SET countAtSymbols TO 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            APPEND character to character storage list
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the list of characters into a single string
    SET processedString TO join characters in character storage list

    // If the string ends with ".", replace it with "dot"
    IF processedString ends with "." THEN
        SET processedString TO substring of processedString up to the second-to-last character followed by "dot"
    END IF

    // Output the final processed string
    PRINT processedString

END
```

### Summary of Pseudocode Components:
- **Input Handling**: Read input and process for specific needs.
- **String Modification**: Replace and prepend specific substrings based on conditions.
- **Character Processing**: Iteratively build a new string based on a given set of rules.
- **Output**: Present the final modified string.

This pseudocode captures the algorithmâ€™s key functions while remaining accessible to those unfamiliar with the original programming language.
