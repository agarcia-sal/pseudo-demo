**Pseudocode:**

1. Begin by reading a single line of input from the standard input and remove any leading or trailing spaces.
2. Replace all occurrences of the word "dot" in the input with the character ".".
3. Replace all occurrences of "at" in the input with the character "@".
4. Check if the first character of the modified input is a ".":
   - If it is, prepend the word "dot" to the modified input after the first character.
5. Initialize a counter to track the occurrences of "@".
6. Create an empty list to hold the final characters of the output.
7. Set a length variable to zero (not used further in this context).
8. If the first character of the modified input is an "@", then:
   - Prepend the word "at" to the modified input after the first character.
9. Iterate through each character in the modified input:
   - For each character, check if it is an "@":
     - If it is an "@", check if the counter is greater than zero:
       - If yes, append the word "at" to the list and reset the counter to one.
       - If no, append the "@" character to the list and set the counter to one.
     - If it is not an "@", simply append the character to the list.
10. Join all elements in the list into a single string to form the final output.
11. Check if the last character of the final output string is a ".":
    - If it is, replace the last character with the word "dot".
12. Output the final modified string.
