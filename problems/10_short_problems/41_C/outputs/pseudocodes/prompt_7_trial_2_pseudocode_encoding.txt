Here is the pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION processEmailAddress(inputString)
    // Read input from standard input and remove leading or trailing whitespace
    SET emailAddress TO inputString.strip()

    // Replace occurrences of 'dot' with '.' and 'at' with '@'
    SET emailAddress TO emailAddress.replace('dot', '.')
    SET emailAddress TO emailAddress.replace('at', '@')

    // Check if the email starts with '.', prepend 'dot' if necessary
    IF emailAddress[0] IS EQUAL TO '.' THEN
        SET emailAddress TO 'dot' + emailAddress[1:]

    // Initialize a counter and a list to rebuild the email
    SET counter TO 0
    INITIALIZE empty list TO emailParts
    SET length TO 0

    // Check if the email starts with '@', prepend 'at' if necessary
    IF emailAddress[0] IS EQUAL TO '@' THEN
        SET emailAddress TO 'at' + emailAddress[1:]

    // Iterate through each character in the email string
    FOR EACH character IN emailAddress DO
        IF character IS EQUAL TO '@' THEN
            // If '@' is found and counter is greater than 0, add 'at' to the list
            IF counter IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
                APPEND 'at' TO emailParts
                SET counter TO 1 
            ELSE
                APPEND '@' TO emailParts
                SET counter TO 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            // Append the current character to the list
            APPEND character TO emailParts
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the list into a string
    SET reconstructedEmail TO ''.join(emailParts)

    // If the reconstructed email ends with '.', replace it with 'dot'
    IF reconstructedEmail[-1] IS EQUAL TO '.' THEN
        SET reconstructedEmail TO reconstructedEmail[:-1] + 'dot'
    END IF

    // Output the processed email address
    PRINT reconstructedEmail

END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition:** The pseudocode defines a function `processEmailAddress`, which takes an input string representing the email address.

2. **Input Handling:** The input is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and certain substrings ('dot' and 'at') are replaced with their respective characters ('.' and '@').

3. **Initial Conditions:** It checks for specific starting characters ('.' and '@') to modify the email address accordingly.

4. **Character Processing:** Each character in the email address is processed to either count occurrences of '@' or add other characters to a list.

5. **Final Adjustments:** After processing, it checks if the reconstructed email ends with a '.', modifying it if necessary.

6. **Output:** Finally, the cleanly formatted email address is printed out.

This pseudocode follows the outlined guidelines, providing a clear, structured, and comprehensible abstraction of the original code.
