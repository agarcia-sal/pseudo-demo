Pseudocode for the provided code:

```
FUNCTION processInput()
    // Read input from the user and remove leading/trailing whitespace
    INPUT_STRING = read user input and remove whitespace
    
    // Replace specific words with their corresponding symbols
    REPLACE "dot" with "."
    REPLACE "at" with "@"

    // If the first character is a '.', prepend 'dot' to the string
    IF first character of INPUT_STRING is '.' THEN
        INPUT_STRING = "dot" + substring(INPUT_STRING from index 1 to end
    
    // Initialize counter and list for building output
    COUNT_AT = 0
    OUTPUT_LIST = an empty list
    
    // If the first character is an '@', prepend 'at' to the string
    IF first character of INPUT_STRING is '@' THEN
        INPUT_STRING = "at" + substring(INPUT_STRING from index 1 to end

    // Iterate through each character in the modified INPUT_STRING
    FOR each CHARACTER in INPUT_STRING DO
        IF CHARACTER is '@' THEN
            // If we have already processed an '@', append "at"
            IF COUNT_AT > 0 THEN
                ADD "at" to OUTPUT_LIST
                COUNT_AT = 1
            ELSE
                ADD "@" to OUTPUT_LIST
                COUNT_AT = 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            // If the character is not '@', just append it to the OUTPUT_LIST
            ADD CHARACTER to OUTPUT_LIST
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Join the OUTPUT_LIST into a single string
    OUTPUT_STRING = join OUTPUT_LIST into a single string

    // Replace a trailing '.' with 'dot' if it exists
    IF last character of OUTPUT_STRING is '.' THEN
        OUTPUT_STRING = substring of OUTPUT_STRING from start to second last character + "dot"
    END IF

    // Print the final processed output
    PRINT OUTPUT_STRING
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
- The pseudocode defines a function `processInput` which encapsulates the logic of the original code.
- It uses descriptive variable names to enhance understanding.
- Each operation is clearly articulated with comments to explain the purpose and effect.
- The control structures (if statements and loops) are expressed in a straightforward way to highlight the flow of logic.
- The processing of input and output is clearly shown, emphasizing the transformations that occur.
