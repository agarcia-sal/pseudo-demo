Here is the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION transformInputString(inputString)
    // Step 1: Read the input and perform initial replacements
    SET processedString = inputString
    REPLACE 'dot' with '.' in processedString
    REPLACE 'at' with '@' in processedString
    
    // Step 2: Ensure the string starts correctly
    IF the first character of processedString is '.' THEN
        PREPEND 'dot' to processedString
    
    // Step 3: Initialize variables for processing
    SET countAtSymbols = 0
    SET transformedCharacters = empty list
    SET length = 0
    
    // Step 4: Check for initial '@' and adjust if necessary
    IF the first character of processedString is '@' THEN
        PREPEND 'at' to processedString
    
    // Step 5: Process each character in the string
    FOR each character in processedString DO
        IF character is '@' THEN
            IF countAtSymbols is greater than 0 THEN
                APPEND 'at' to transformedCharacters
                SET countAtSymbols = 1 
            ELSE
                APPEND '@' to transformedCharacters
                SET countAtSymbols = 1
            END IF
        ELSE
            APPEND character to transformedCharacters
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 6: Combine transformed characters into a single string
    SET finalString = join transformedCharacters into a single string
    
    // Step 7: Adjust the ending of the final string if necessary
    IF the last character of finalString is '.' THEN
        REMOVE the last character of finalString
        APPEND 'dot' to finalString
    END IF
    
    // Step 8: Return the transformed string
    RETURN finalString
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
SET input = read input from standard input
SET result = transformInputString(input)
PRINT result
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Overview:** A function named `transformInputString` is defined to take an input string and perform specified transformations.
2. **Read Input:** The input string is processed to replace specific substrings ('dot' and 'at') with their respective symbols ('.' and '@').
3. **String Adjustments:** Checks if the string begins with certain characters and adjusts appropriately (e.g., prepending 'dot' if it starts with '.').
4. **Character Processing:** Iterates through each character of the processed string, keeping track of how many '@' have been processed to avoid consecutive appends of 'at'.
5. **Final Adjustments:** The final result is modified if it ends with a '.', changing it to 'dot'.
6. **Return the Result:** The function finally returns the transformed string, which is then printed as the result.

This structure clarifies the transformations and logical checks performed on the input string while maintaining a readable and understandable format.
