**Purpose Summary:**  
The objective of this code is to determine the smallest non-negative integer that, when summed in a specific mathematical manner, either equals or exceeds a given input number, and to print this integer when certain conditions are met.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Get Input:**
   - Read an integer value from the user.
   - Convert the input to its absolute value (discarding any negative sign).

3. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current number we are evaluating.

4. **Repeat Until Condition Met:**
   - **While True:**
     - Calculate `sum_` as the sum of all integers from 0 to `index`. This can be determined using the formula:
       - `sum_ = index * (index + 1) / 2`
     - Calculate `dif` as:
       - `dif = sum_ - inp`
     
     - **Check Conditions:**
       - If `sum_` is equal to `inp`:
         - Print `index` (this is the solution) and stop the program.
       
       - If `sum_` is greater than `inp`:
         - If `dif` is an even number:
           - Print `index` (this is the solution) and stop the program.

     - Increment `index` by 1.

5. **End Program** 

**Comments on Logic:**  
- The code calculates the triangular number for the current index. It checks if this triangular number is equal to or greater than the given absolute input.
- If the sum equals the input, that index is printed.
- If the sum surpasses the input, the program checks if the difference between the sum and the input is even before printing the index as a valid result. This is important to ensure that a “balanced” solution can exist based on certain mathematical properties of numbers.

This pseudocode presents a clearer logical structure that effectively conveys the intent of the original code without using specific programming syntax.
