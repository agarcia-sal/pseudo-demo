**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Get Input:**
   - Read an integer value from the user.
   - Convert the input to its absolute value (discarding any negative sign).

3. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current number we are evaluating.

4. **Repeat Until Condition Met:**
   - **While True:**
     - Calculate `sum_up_to_index` as the sum of all integers from 0 to `index`. This can be determined using the formula:
       - `sum_up_to_index = index * (index + 1) / 2`
     - Calculate `difference` as:
       - `difference = sum_up_to_index - input_value`
     
     - **Check Conditions:**
       - If `sum_up_to_index` is equal to `input_value`:
         - Print `index` (this is the solution) and stop the program.
       
       - If `sum_up_to_index` is greater than `input_value`:
         - If `difference` is an even number:
           - Print `index` (this is the solution) and stop the program.

     - Increment `index` by 1.

5. **End Program** 

This pseudocode presents a clearer logical structure that effectively conveys the intent of the original code without using specific programming syntax.
