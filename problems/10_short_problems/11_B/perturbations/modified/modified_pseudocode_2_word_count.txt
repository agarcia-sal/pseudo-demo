**Purpose Summary:**  
The goal of this code is to find a number (i) such that the sum of all integers from 1 to i is equal to a given positive integer (n) or the difference between this sum and n is an even number.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
2. **Get User Input**
   - Convert the user-provided input to an integer.
   - Take the absolute value of this integer and assign it to a variable named `desiredNumber`.

3. **Initialize Variables**
   - Set a counter `index` to 0.

4. **Begin Loop (indefinitely)**
   - Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to `index` and store it in a variable `currentSum`.
     - The formula to compute this sum is: `currentSum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`
   
   - Calculate the difference between `currentSum` and `desiredNumber` and store it in `difference`.
     - `difference = currentSum - desiredNumber`
   
   - **Check Conditions**
     - **If `currentSum` equals `desiredNumber`:**
       - Print the value of `index`.  (This means we found a perfect match)
       - Exit the loop.
     - **Else if `currentSum` is greater than `desiredNumber`:**
       - **If `difference` is even:** (Check if `difference` divided by 2 has no remainder)
         - Print the value of `index`. (This means the difference is even, indicating a valid solution)
         - Exit the loop.

   - Increment the `index` by 1.

5. **End Loop**
  
6. **End Program**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The purpose of using the formula for `currentSum` is to efficiently calculate the sum of integers without needing to add them one by one.
- The use of `abs(int(input()))` ensures that the input number is positive, as negative sums do not contribute to the intended logic.
- The `index` variable helps find which integer's cumulative sum is either equal to or sufficiently exceeds the target sum, allowing the program to check for even differences.
