**Purpose**: The code is designed to find the smallest non-negative integer that meets certain conditions related to the input number, ultimately printing this integer when found.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start the Program**
  
2. **Get Input**:
   - Prompt the user for a number.
   - Convert the input to an integer and take the absolute value.
   - Assign this value to a variable named `targetNumber`.

3. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set `currentIndex` to 0, which will help track the current integer we are checking.

4. **Continuous Loop**:
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

     a. **Calculate Sum**:
        - Calculate the sum of the first `currentIndex` integers using the formula: `sumOfFirstCurrent = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2`.

     b. **Determine Difference**:
        - Calculate the difference between `sumOfFirstCurrent` and `targetNumber`, assigning it to a variable named `difference`.

     c. **Check Conditions**:
        - **Condition 1**: If `sumOfFirstCurrent` equals `targetNumber`, then:
          - Print `currentIndex` (this is the result).
          - Exit the loop.

        - **Condition 2**: If `sumOfFirstCurrent` is greater than `targetNumber`, then:
          - If `difference` is an even number:
            - Print `currentIndex` (this is the result).
            - Exit the loop.

     d. **Increment Current Index**:
        - Increase `currentIndex` by 1.

5. **End of Program**

**Comments**:
- The loop continues until one of the conditions for printing the `currentIndex` is satisfied.
- The check for evenness ensures that a solution is only printed when it meets the specific criteria related to the `difference`.

### Example of Flow:
- If the user inputs the number 3, the loop calculates sums (0, 1, 3, 6...) and checks their relationship to 3 until it finds:
  - `currentIndex = 2` gives `sumOfFirstCurrent = 3`, so it prints 2.
- If the number were 5, it might find that `currentIndex = 3` provides a correct condition (as the difference would be even), and it would print 3 at that stage.
