**Pseudocode: Finding the Smallest Integer with Specific Properties**

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set `n` to the absolute value of the integer received as input.
   - Set `i` to 0

2. **Loop Indefinitely:**
   - Repeat the following steps until a suitable integer is found:

     a. **Calculate Sum:**
        - Compute the sum `s` of the first `i` integers using the formula: 
          - `s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2` 

     b. **Determine Difference:**
        - Calculate `m` as the difference between `s` and `n`

     c. **Check for Conditions:**
        - If the computed sum `s` equals `n`, 
          - Print the value of `i` and exit the loop.
        
        - If the computed sum `s` is greater than `n`, 
          - Check if the difference `m` is even:
            - If `m` is even, 
              - Print the value of `i` and exit the loop.
        
     d. **Increment Counter:**
        - Increase the value of `i` by 1 

3. **End of Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm ends when a suitable value of `i` is printed.
