Certainly! Below is the pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided code snippet, structured clearly for understanding:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read input
    INPUT number as n
    n = absolute value of n
    Initialize index as i = 0

    // Step 2: Loop indefinitely to find the required value
    WHILE true DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers
        Set sum as s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and the input number
        Set difference as m = s - n
        
        // Step 3: Check if the sum equals the input number
        IF sum equals n THEN
            OUTPUT i  // Output the index when sum matches input number
            BREAK  // Exit the loop
        
        // Step 4: Check if the sum exceeds the input number
        ELSE IF sum greater than n THEN
            // Step 5: Check if the difference is even
            IF difference is even THEN
                OUTPUT i  // Output the index if the difference is even
                BREAK  // Exit the loop
        
        // Step 6: Increment index for the next iteration
        Increment index i by 1

END
```

### Key Points of this Pseudocode:
- **Inputs and Outputs:** Clearly indicates input collection and the outputs based on conditions.
- **Logical Flow:** Describes the loop and conditional checks with straightforward language.
- **Readable Format:** Organizes steps with appropriate indentation and comments for clarity. 
- **Use of Meaningful Names:** Descriptive variable names help in understanding the purpose of each variable without using technical jargon.
