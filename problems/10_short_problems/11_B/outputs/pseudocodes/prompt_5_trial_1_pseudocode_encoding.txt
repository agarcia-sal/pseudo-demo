**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose triangular number is equal to or exceeds a given non-negative integer, and, if the difference is even, to return that integer.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Accept an integer input from the user and convert it to a non-negative value
    INPUT user_input
    number = absolute_value_of(convert_to_integer(user_input))

    // Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the triangular number index
    index = 0

    // Continuously calculate triangular numbers until a condition is met
    WHILE true DO
        
        // Calculate the current triangular number using the formula n(n + 1) / 2
        triangular_number = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the triangular number and the input number
        difference = triangular_number - number

        // Check if the triangular number is equal to the input number
        IF triangular_number equals number THEN
            // If they are equal, print the current index
            OUTPUT index
            BREAK // Exit the loop
        
        // Check if the triangular number exceeds the input number
        ELSE IF triangular_number is greater than number THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference is even THEN
                // If the difference is even, print the current index
                OUTPUT index
                BREAK // Exit the loop
        
        // Increment the index for the next triangular number calculation
        index = index + 1

END
```

### Comments for Clarity:
- The `absolute_value_of` function ensures that the input integer is non-negative, which is crucial since we're calculating triangular numbers.
- The `triangular_number` is computed with the formula which sums the first `index` natural numbers.
- The loop will iterate endlessly until a break condition is satisfied, ensuring that all triangular numbers are considered until an appropriate one is found.
- Checking if `difference` is even uses a straightforward mathematical check.
- The pseudocode is structured sequentially, improving readability and ensuring logical clarity.
