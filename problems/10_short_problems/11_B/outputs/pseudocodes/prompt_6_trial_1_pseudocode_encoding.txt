1. Initialize a variable 'absoluteValue' to the absolute value of user input converted to an integer.
2. Initialize a counter variable 'currentIndex' to 0.

3. Start an indefinite loop:
    a. Calculate the sum 'sumOfIntegers' as the triangular number for 'currentIndex' using the formula (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2.
    b. Calculate the difference 'difference' as the result of subtracting 'absoluteValue' from 'sumOfIntegers'.

    c. If 'sumOfIntegers' is equal to 'absoluteValue':
        i. Output 'currentIndex' as the result.
        ii. Exit the loop.

    d. Else if 'sumOfIntegers' is greater than 'absoluteValue':
        i. If 'difference' is even:
            - Output 'currentIndex' as the result.
            - Exit the loop.

    e. Increment 'currentIndex' by 1.

End of loop.

### Notes:
- This pseudocode provides a straightforward understanding of how the original code operates.
- The main logic regarding the triangular number computation and checking conditions for output has been preserved while enhancing readability.
- Descriptive variable names were chosen to convey the purpose of values clearly.
- Control structures such as loops and conditional statements have been presented in a simple and easy-to-follow manner.
