Here's the pseudocode that translates the provided code into a clear and understandable format:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read the absolute value of an integer input
    SET number = absolute value of (input integer)

    // Step 2: Initialize the index variable
    SET index = 0

    // Step 3: Start an infinite loop to find a suitable index
    WHILE TRUE DO
        
        // Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers (triangular number)
        SET sum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2

        // Step 5: Calculate the difference between the sum and the input number
        SET difference = sum - number

        // Step 6: Check if the sum equals the input number
        IF sum EQUALS number THEN
            PRINT index    // Output the current index
            BREAK          // Exit the loop
        
        // Step 7: Check if the sum exceeds the input number
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN number THEN
            
            // Step 8: Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT index  // Output the current index
                BREAK        // Exit the loop
        
        // Step 9: Increment the index variable for the next iteration
        SET index = index + 1
    
END
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode starts by taking an integer input and computing its absolute value.
- It initializes an index that will be used to calculate triangular numbers (sums of the first n integers).
- An infinite loop is started, where the triangular number corresponding to the current index is calculated.
- Two conditions are checked: if this triangular number matches the input number, or if it exceeds it, and if the difference is even in the latter case.
- If any of these conditions are satisfied, the index is printed, and the loop is exited. The index is incremented if none of the conditions are satisfied, continuing the process until finding a valid index.
