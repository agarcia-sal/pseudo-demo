Here's the pseudocode that represents the logic and flow of the given code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Obtain an absolute integer value from user input
    SET userInput TO ABSOLUTE_VALUE( CONVERT_TO_INTEGER( GET_USER_INPUT() ) )
    
    // Step 2: Initialize a counter variable
    SET counter TO 0
    
    // Step 3: Continuously process until a break condition is met
    WHILE TRUE DO
        
        // Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first 'counter' numbers
        SET sum TO (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2
        
        // Step 5: Calculate the difference between the sum and the user input
        SET difference TO sum - userInput
        
        // Step 6: Check if the sum equals the user input
        IF sum EQUALS userInput THEN
            PRINT counter   // Output the current counter value
            BREAK           // Exit the loop
            
        // Step 7: Check if the sum is greater than the user input
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN userInput THEN
            
            // Step 8: Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT counter   // Output the current counter value
                BREAK           // Exit the loop
                
        // Step 9: Increment the counter for the next iteration
        INCREMENT counter BY 1
        
    END WHILE

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts by obtaining a non-negative integer from the user, ensuring that it's an absolute value.
2. **Initialization:** A counter is initialized to track how many numbers are summed.
3. **Loop Structure:** A loop is set up to continuously calculate the sum of the first `counter` natural numbers.
4. **Sum Comparison:** The sum is compared with the user input to check for two conditions: direct equality and excess.
5. **Output Conditions:** If either condition is met, the current value of the counter is printed, and the loop is exited.
6. **Counter Increment:** If neither condition is satisfied, the counter is incremented for the next iteration.

This structured flow allows someone not familiar with the original code to understand the logical steps involved in solving the task.
