**Pseudocode: Find Minimum Integer with Specific Sum Properties**

1. **Start**
2. **Input**: Read an integer value, `n`, and take its absolute value.
3. **Initialize**: Set a variable `i` to 0 (this will represent the current integer).
4. **Loop Continuously**: 
    - Calculate `s`, the sum of the first `i` integers using the formula: 
      ```
      s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
      ```
    - Calculate `m`, the difference between the sum `s` and the input `n`: 
      ```
      m = s - n
      ```
      
    - **Check Conditions**:
        - If `s` is exactly equal to `n`, then print `i` and exit the loop.
        - If `s` is greater than `n`, then check the following:
            - If `m` is an even number:
                - Print `i` and exit the loop.
    
    - **Increment**: Increase the value of `i` by 1 to check the next integer.
5. **End Loop**: (The loop exits once a print statement is executed and the program is done.)
6. **End** 

**Description of Output**: The algorithm will output the integer `i` that satisfies the conditions described above, which indicates either that the sum of the first `i` integers equals `n` or that the difference from `n` (when the sum exceeds it) allows for the difference to be adjusted by an even number.
