**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
2. **Get Input:**
   - Read an integer input from the user
   - Store the absolute value of the input in a variable `targetValue`
3. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter variable `index` to 0
4. **Loop Forever:**
   - While true, repeat the following steps:
     1. **Calculate Sum:**
        - Compute the triangular number `sumValue` as the sum of the first `index` integers using the formula `sumValue = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`
     2. **Calculate Difference:**
        - Compute the difference `difference` by subtracting `targetValue` from `sumValue` (i.e., `difference = sumValue - targetValue`)
     3. **Check Conditions:**
        - If `sumValue` is equal to `targetValue`:
          - Print the value of `index` (this means we found the exact match)
          - Exit the loop
        - Else if `sumValue` is greater than `targetValue`:
          - If `difference` is even:
            - Print the value of `index` (this indicates we can balance out the excess)
            - Exit the loop
     4. **Increment Counter:**
        - Increase the value of `index` by 1
5. **End Program** 

This pseudocode effectively summarizes the logic by capturing the input retrieval, the use of a loop to generate triangular numbers, and conditions to determine when to output results.
