### Explanation of Pseudocode:
- The function `findInteger` takes a single integer input `n` and processes it to find a specific index `i`.
- It calculates the sum of integers from 0 to `i` and compares this sum to the input `n`.
- If the sum equals `n`, it prints `i` and exits.
- If the sum exceeds `n` and the difference is even, it again prints `i` and exits.
- If neither condition is met, it continues to the next index while incrementing `i`. 
- The loop is designed to run indefinitely until one of the exit conditions is satisfied.
