Below is the pseudocode translation of the provided code, following the guided steps outlined:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Initialize the main variables
    SET n TO absolute value of integer input
    SET i TO 0

    // Step 2: Start an infinite loop for calculations
    WHILE TRUE DO

        // Calculate the sum of the first i integers
        SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the current sum and n
        SET m TO s - n

        // Check if the sum is equal to n
        IF s EQUALS n THEN
            PRINT i  // Output the current value of i
            BREAK     // Exit the loop

        // Check if the sum is greater than n
        ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
            
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF m MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT i  // Output the current value of i
                BREAK     // Exit the loop

        // Increment i for the next iteration
        INCREMENT i BY 1

    END WHILE

END
```

### Assumptions:
1. `input` function is defined to capture user input and convert it to an integer.
2. The `absolute value` operation is defined to handle negative inputs.
3. The `PRINT` function outputs values to the console.
4. The loop will eventually terminate due to the conditional checks, ensuring that it does not run indefinitely.
