**Pseudocode for Finding a Value Based on Input**

```
1. Begin

2. Get the absolute integer value from user input and store it in `inputValue`

3. Initialize a counter `currentIndex` to 0

4. Repeat indefinitely (this creates a loop that will run until it is broken)
   a. Calculate the sum of the first `currentIndex` natural numbers and store it in `sumOfNaturals`
      - Formula: sumOfNaturals = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2
   
   b. Calculate the difference from `inputValue` and store it in `difference`
      - difference = sumOfNaturals - inputValue
   
   c. Check if `sumOfNaturals` is equal to `inputValue`
      - If true, then:
        i. Output `currentIndex`
        ii. Exit the loop (stop the program)
   
   d. Check if `sumOfNaturals` is greater than `inputValue`
      - If true, then:
        i. Check if `difference` is an even number
           - If true, then:
              - Output `currentIndex`
              - Exit the loop (stop the program)

   e. Increment `currentIndex` by 1 (move to the next natural number)

5. End
```

### Explanation:
- The algorithm continuously calculates the sum of the first `currentIndex` natural numbers.
- It then checks whether this sum matches or exceeds the absolute value of the input number.
- If there's a match, it outputs `currentIndex`.
- If the sum exceeds the input and the difference is even, it also outputs `currentIndex`.
- The loop continues until one of these conditions is satisfied.
