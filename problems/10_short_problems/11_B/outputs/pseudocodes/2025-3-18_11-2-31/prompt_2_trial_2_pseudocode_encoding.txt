**Pseudocode: Finding a number based on a given input**

1. Begin by obtaining an absolute integer input and assign it to a variable named "targetNumber."
2. Initialize a variable "index" to zero to keep track of the current number being processed.
3. Create an infinite loop that will continue until a designated condition is met.
   
   a. Within the loop, calculate the sum of the first "index" natural numbers and assign this value to a variable called "currentSum."
   b. Calculate the difference between "currentSum" and "targetNumber," and assign this value to a variable named "difference."
   
   c. Check if "currentSum" is equal to "targetNumber."
      - If they are equal, print the value of "index" and exit the loop.
   
   d. If "currentSum" is greater than "targetNumber," check if "difference" is an even number.
      - If "difference" is even, print the value of "index" and exit the loop.
   
   e. Increment "index" by one to progress to the next number.

4. End the process after a valid value has been printed.
