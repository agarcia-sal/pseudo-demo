**Pseudocode:**

```
1. Start
2. Initialize variable n as the absolute value of the integer input from the user
3. Set variable i to 0

4. Repeat indefinitely:
    a. Calculate variable s as the sum of the first i natural numbers using the formula: s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
    b. Calculate variable m as the difference between s and n: m = s - n

    c. If s is equal to n:
        i. Print the value of i
        ii. Exit the loop

    d. Else If s is greater than n:
        i. If m is even:
            A. Print the value of i
            B. Exit the loop

    e. Increment i by 1
5. End
```

**Assumptions:**
- The variable `n` is expected to be a non-negative integer.
- The input from the user is always a valid integer that can be converted.
