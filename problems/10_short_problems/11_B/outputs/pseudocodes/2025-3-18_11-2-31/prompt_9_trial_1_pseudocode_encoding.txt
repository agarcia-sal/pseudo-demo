**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` such that the sum of the first `i` integers equals a given positive integer `n`, or if the sum exceeds `n`, determine if the difference can be expressed as an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize necessary variables:**
   - Set `n` to the absolute value of the integer input received from the user.
   - Initialize `i` to 0 (this will represent the count of integers being summed).

2. **Begin an infinite loop to calculate and check sums:**
   - While true:
     1. Calculate the sum `s` of the first `i` integers using the formula:  
        `s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2`
     2. Calculate the difference `m` between the current sum `s` and the target number `n`:  
        `m = s - n`
     
     3. **Check if the current sum equals the target:**
        - If `s` is equal to `n`:
          - Print the current count `i` as the answer.
          - Exit the loop.

     4. **Check if the current sum exceeds the target:**
        - If `s` is greater than `n`:
          - Check if the difference `m` is an even number:
            - If `m` is even:
              - Print the current count `i` as the answer.
              - Exit the loop.

     5. **Increment the counter:**
        - Increase `i` by 1 to include the next integer in the next iteration.

**Input and Output:**
- Input: An integer provided by the user, which is transformed to its absolute value.
- Output: The smallest non-negative integer `i` that meets the conditions outlined above.

This pseudocode maintains the logical flow of the original code while presenting it in a clear, human-readable format for better understanding.
