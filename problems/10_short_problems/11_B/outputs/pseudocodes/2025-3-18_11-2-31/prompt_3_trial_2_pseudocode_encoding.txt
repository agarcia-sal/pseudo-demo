Certainly! Below is the pseudocode representation of the provided code snippet, structured to emphasize the intent, logic, and flow of the algorithm.

```plaintext
START

// Step 1: Get the absolute value of user input and convert it to an integer
SET targetValue = ABSOLUTE_VALUE(READ_USER_INPUT())

// Step 2: Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the current iteration
SET index = 0

// Step 3: Begin an infinite loop to compute values until a condition is met
WHILE TRUE DO
    
    // Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
    SET sum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
    
    // Step 5: Calculate the difference between the current sum and the target value
    SET difference = sum - targetValue
    
    // Step 6: Check if the current sum matches the target value
    IF sum EQUALS targetValue THEN
        PRINT index  // Output the current index
        BREAK  // Exit the loop
        
    // Step 7: Check if the current sum exceeds the target value
    ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN targetValue THEN
        // Step 8: Check if the difference is even
        IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
            PRINT index  // Output the current index
            BREAK  // Exit the loop
    
    // Step 9: Increment the index to explore the next number
    INCREMENT index BY 1

END
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Handling:** The process starts by reading the user input and converting it to an absolute integer value, which will be the target for calculations.
  
2. **Loop Structure:** An infinite loop is initiated, tasked with calculating the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers until either a match or a suitable condition is found.

3. **Sum Calculation:** The sum is calculated based on the index, and its difference from the target value is computed.

4. **Conditions and Output:** The pseudocode checks two main conditions:
   - **Exact Match:** If the calculated sum equals the target value, it outputs the current index and exits.
   - **Surpassing Target:** If the sum exceeds the target, it checks if the difference is even before outputting the index and exiting.

5. **Iteration:** The index is increased after each iteration to continue exploring potential sums.

This pseudocode is designed to be readable and understandable, allowing someone without programming experience to grasp the logic behind the original code.
