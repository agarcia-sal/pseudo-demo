Below is the pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided code snippet by emphasizing the algorithm's intent and structure.

```
# Begin the algorithm to find the result based on an integer input

# STEP 1: Get the absolute value of the user input
INPUT_VALUE = absolute_value_of(integer_input)

# Initialize a counter variable
counter = 0

# STEP 2: Continuous loop until a condition is met
WHILE TRUE DO
    # Calculate the sum of the first 'counter' integers
    sum_of_integers = (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2

    # Calculate the difference between the current sum and the input value
    difference = sum_of_integers - INPUT_VALUE
    
    # STEP 3: Check if the current sum equals the input value
    IF sum_of_integers IS EQUAL TO INPUT_VALUE THEN
        PRINT counter  # Output the current counter
        BREAK  # Exit the loop

    # STEP 4: Check if the current sum exceeds the input value
    ELSE IF sum_of_integers IS GREATER THAN INPUT_VALUE THEN
        # Check if the difference is even
        IF difference MOD 2 IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
            PRINT counter  # Output the current counter
            BREAK  # Exit the loop

    # STEP 5: Increment the counter for the next iteration
    counter = counter + 1

# End of algorithm
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode begins by capturing the intent of taking an absolute integer input.
- It initializes a counter to keep track of the current number being processed.
- A loop runs indefinitely until either of the stopping conditions is met:
  - If the sum of integers equals the input value, the current counter is printed.
  - If the sum exceeds the input value and the difference is even, the counter is also printed.
- The counter is incremented in each iteration to explore the next integer.
- Each step is clearly described to ensure the logic is easy to follow without relying on specific programming syntax.
