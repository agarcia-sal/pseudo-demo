**Pseudocode:**

```
1. START

2. DECLARE integer variable n
3. SET n = absolute value of the integer input from the user

4. DECLARE integer variable i and initialize it to 0

5. WHILE true DO
    6. CALCULATE s as the sum of the first i integers using the formula s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
    7. SET m = s - n

    8. IF s is equal to n THEN
        9. PRINT i
        10. BREAK the loop

    11. ELSE IF s is greater than n THEN
        12. IF m is even THEN
            13. PRINT i
            14. BREAK the loop

    15. INCREMENT i by 1

16. END WHILE

17. END
```

**Assumptions:**
- The input provided by the user is a valid integer.
- The result of the operations performed on integers will not cause overflow.
