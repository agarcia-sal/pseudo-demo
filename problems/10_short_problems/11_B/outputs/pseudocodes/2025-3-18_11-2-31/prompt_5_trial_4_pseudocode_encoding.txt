**Purpose:** This code is designed to find the smallest non-negative integer that either has a triangular number equal to a given input or can achieve that by adjusting (increasing or decreasing) the triangular number by an even integer.

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read the absolute value of user input and assign it to the variable 'targetNumber'
    targetNumber = Absolute Value of Integer User Input

    // Step 2: Initialize a variable 'index' to keep track of the current triangular number index
    index = 0

    // Step 3: Start an indefinite loop to find the required triangular number
    WHILE true DO
        
        // Step 4: Calculate the triangular number based on the current index
        triangularNumber = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Step 5: Find the difference between the current triangular number and the target number
        difference = triangularNumber - targetNumber
        
        // Step 6: Check if the current triangular number is equal to the target number
        IF triangularNumber is equal to targetNumber THEN
            // Step 7: Print the current index as it satisfies the condition
            PRINT index
            // Step 8: Exit the loop since the solution is found
            BREAK

        // Step 9: Check if the current triangular number is greater than the target number
        ELSE IF triangularNumber is greater than targetNumber THEN
            // Step 10: Check if the difference is even
            IF difference is even THEN
                // Step 11: Print the current index as it satisfies the condition
                PRINT index
                // Step 12: Exit the loop since the solution is found
                BREAK
        END IF
        
        // Step 13: Increment the index to calculate the next triangular number in the next iteration
        index = index + 1

    END WHILE

END
```

**Explanation of Key Components:**

- **Variable Names:** Descriptive names like `targetNumber`, `index`, `triangularNumber`, and `difference` clearly indicate their purpose.
- **Control Structures:** Loops and conditionals are articulated using clear phrases to describe their function, making it intuitive to follow the flow of logic.
- **High-Level Operations:** The process of calculating triangular numbers and determining even differences is broken down into simple actions, facilitating understanding.
- **Input and Output:** The pseudocode indicates that it accepts user input as an integer and produces an integer output representing the satisfying index.
- **Accessibility:** The pseudocode is designed to be clear for readers who may not have programming expertise while conveying the fundamental logic of the original code accurately.
