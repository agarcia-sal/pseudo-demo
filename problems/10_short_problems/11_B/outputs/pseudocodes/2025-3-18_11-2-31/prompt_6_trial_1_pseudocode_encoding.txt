Here is the pseudocode translation of the provided code snippet:

```plaintext
# Begin algorithm to find the smallest non-negative integer i 
# such that the sum of the first i integers equals n or is larger than n 
# and the difference is even.

# Get absolute value of input as a non-negative integer
inputValue = abs(getUserInput())  # Input must be treated as an integer
index = 0  # Initialize index i to zero

# Start an infinite loop to find the required integer
while True:
    # Calculate the sum of the first index integers
    sumOfIntegers = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
    
    # Calculate the difference between the sum and the target input value
    difference = sumOfIntegers - inputValue
    
    # Check if the sum equals the input value
    if sumOfIntegers == inputValue:
        # If it matches, print the current index and exit
        print(index)
        break  # Exit the loop
    
    # Check if the sum exceeds the input value
    elif sumOfIntegers > inputValue:
        # Check if the difference is even
        if difference is even:
            # If the difference is even, print the current index and exit
            print(index)
            break  # Exit the loop
            
    # Increment the index for the next iteration
    index = index + 1  # Move to the next integer
```
### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by obtaining a user input, ensuring it is a non-negative integer.
- **Loop Structure**: An infinite loop is established to continually calculate the sum of integers.
- **Calculations**: In each iteration, the sum of integers from 0 to the current index is calculated, and a difference from the input value is also computed.
- **Conditions**: The logic checks:
  - If the sum matches the input value, it will print the index and exit.
  - If the sum surpasses the input value, it checks if the difference is even before printing the index and exiting.
- **Index Increment**: At the end of each loop iteration, the index is incremented for the next calculation. 

This structure allows for a clear understanding of the algorithm's intent and operations without getting lost in technical jargon or syntax.
