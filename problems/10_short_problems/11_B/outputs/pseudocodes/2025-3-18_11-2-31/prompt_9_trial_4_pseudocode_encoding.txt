**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to find an integer \( i \) such that the sum of the first \( i \) integers either equals a given number \( n \) or can be adjusted to equal \( n \) by removing an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read an integer from the user and store it in a variable called `input_number`.
   - Set `n` equal to the absolute value of `input_number`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set `i` to 0.

3. **Start Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat indefinitely:
     1. Calculate the sum of the first `i` integers and store it in a variable called `sum_of_first_i`.
        - This is calculated using the formula: `sum_of_first_i = (i * (i + 1)) / 2`.
     2. Calculate the difference between `sum_of_first_i` and `n` and store it in a variable called `difference`.
        - `difference = sum_of_first_i - n`.

     3. **Check for a Match:**
        - If `sum_of_first_i` is equal to `n`, then:
          - Print `i`.
          - Exit the loop.

     4. **Check for Greater Sum:**
        - If `sum_of_first_i` is greater than `n`, then:
          - Check if `difference` is an even number:
            - If true, then:
              - Print `i`.
              - Exit the loop.

     5. **Increment Counter:**
        - Increase the value of `i` by 1.

4. **End of Algorithm:**
   - The process continues until a valid value of `i` is found and printed. 

**Input and Output:**
- This program takes a single integer as input and produces an integer output that meets the conditions described above.

**Final Review:**
- Ensure that the logic of checking the sum and its relationship with `n` is maintained clearly.
- Confirm that the instructions allow for easy understanding of the program flow without the need for specific programming knowledge.
