**Pseudocode:**

1. Start by obtaining a positive integer input from the user and store its absolute value in a variable called `targetValue`.

2. Initialize a counter variable called `currentIndex` to 0.

3. Enter an infinite loop to repeatedly calculate the following:
   - Compute the sum of the first `currentIndex` natural numbers and store this value in a variable called `currentSum`.
   - Determine the difference between `currentSum` and `targetValue`, and store it in a variable called `difference`.

4. Check if `currentSum` is equal to `targetValue`:
   - If they are equal, output the value of `currentIndex` and exit the loop.

5. If `currentSum` is greater than `targetValue`, move to the next step:
   - Check if `difference` is an even number:
     - If it is even, output the value of `currentIndex` and exit the loop.

6. If neither condition is met, increment `currentIndex` by 1 and continue the loop.

7. End the process. 

**Input:** A positive integer from the user.  
**Output:** An integer that satisfies specified conditions based on the calculated sum.
