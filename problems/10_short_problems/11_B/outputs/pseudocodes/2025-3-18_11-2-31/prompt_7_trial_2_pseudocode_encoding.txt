FUNCTION findIntegerBasedOnInput
    PROMPT user for an integer input and assign absolute value to variable userInput
    INITIALIZE index to 0

    WHILE true DO
        CALCULATE the sum of the first index integers as sumValue with formula (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        CALCULATE the difference as differenceValue equal to sumValue - userInput

        IF sumValue equals userInput THEN
            OUTPUT index
            BREAK the loop
        ELSE IF sumValue is greater than userInput THEN
            IF differenceValue is even THEN
                OUTPUT index
                BREAK the loop

        INCREMENT index by 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION

### Context and Breakdown:
- **Purpose**: This pseudocode translates an algorithm that reads an integer input from the user, processes it to find a specific integer `index` that satisfies certain conditions based on the sum of the first `index` integers.
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The function takes a single integer input from the user and outputs the integer `index` found based on the conditions evaluated in the loop.
- **Control Structures**: The loop continues indefinitely until one of the break conditions is met (either finding an exact sum match or an appropriate even difference). Each check is clearly articulated with conditions outlined.
