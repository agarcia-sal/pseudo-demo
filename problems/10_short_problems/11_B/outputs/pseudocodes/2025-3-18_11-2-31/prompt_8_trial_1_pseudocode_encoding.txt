### Purpose
The code calculates and identifies a non-negative integer that fulfills certain mathematical properties involving summation and adjustments.

### Pseudocode

1. **Get and Prepare Input**  
   - Read an integer input from the user.  
   - Take the absolute value of the input and store it as a variable named `targetSum`.

2. **Initialize Counter**  
   - Set a counter variable `index` to 0.  

3. **Start Infinite Loop**  
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

   4. **Calculate Triangular Number**  
      - Calculate the sum of the first `index` integers using the formula:  
        `triangularNumber = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`.

   5. **Calculate Difference**  
      - Determine the difference between `triangularNumber` and `targetSum`,  
        storing this as `difference = triangularNumber - targetSum`.  

   6. **Check for Equality**  
      - If `triangularNumber` is equal to `targetSum`:
        - Print the value of `index`.  
        - Exit the loop.

   7. **Check for Overreach**  
      - If `triangularNumber` is greater than `targetSum`:
        - If `difference` is even:
          - Print the value of `index`.  
          - Exit the loop.

   8. **Increment Counter**  
      - Increase the value of `index` by 1.

### Comments for Clarity
- The loop continues to compute triangular numbers (the sums of the first `index` natural numbers) until it either finds a triangular number that matches the input or a triangular number that exceeds the input by an even amount.
- This approach works because triangular numbers have specific properties related to their position in the sequence, which allows for this unique checking mechanism.

### Example Structure
```plaintext
Read user input and store as targetSum
Set index to 0
Repeat indefinitely:
    Calculate triangularNumber as (index * (index + 1)) / 2
    Set difference to triangularNumber - targetSum
    If triangularNumber equals targetSum:
        Print index and exit loop
    Else if triangularNumber greater than targetSum:
        If difference is even:
            Print index and exit loop
    Increment index by 1
```

### Review
This pseudocode accurately reflects the logic of the original code, breaking down the operations into comprehensible steps while maintaining clarity regarding variable purposes and flow of control.
