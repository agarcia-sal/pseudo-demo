**Pseudocode:**

1. Begin the program.
2. Prompt the user for an input number, ensuring it is a positive integer by taking the absolute value.
3. Set a counter variable, named "current_index", to 0.
4. Enter an infinite loop to continuously perform calculations:
   a. Calculate the sum of the first "current_index" integers. Store this value in a variable called "sum_of_indices".
   b. Calculate the difference between "sum_of_indices" and the input number, storing this as "difference".
   c. Check if "sum_of_indices" is equal to the input number:
      - If it is, output the value of "current_index" and exit the loop.
   d. Otherwise, check if "sum_of_indices" is greater than the input number:
      - If it is, check if the "difference" is an even number:
         * If "difference" is even, output the value of "current_index" and exit the loop.
   e. Increase the value of "current_index" by 1 to proceed to the next integer.
5. End the program.
