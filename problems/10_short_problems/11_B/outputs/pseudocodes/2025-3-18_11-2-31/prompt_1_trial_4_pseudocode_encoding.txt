**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**

2. **Input:**
   - Read an integer value from the user and store its absolute value in `n`.

3. **Initialize:**
   - Set `i` to 0.

4. **Loop:**
   - Repeat indefinitely:
     - Calculate the sum `s` of the first `i` natural numbers using the formula:
       - `s` equals `i` multiplied by (`i` plus 1) divided by 2.
     - Compute `m` as the difference between `s` and `n`:
       - `m` equals `s` minus `n`.
     
     - **Conditional Checks:**
       - If `s` equals `n`:
         - Output the value of `i`.
         - Stop the loop.
       - If `s` is greater than `n`:
         - If `m` is even:
           - Output the value of `i`.
           - Stop the loop.
     
     - Increment `i` by 1.

5. **End**
