### Purpose
The objective of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` such that the sum of the first `i` integers is either equal to or greater than a given absolute input number, `n`. If the sum is greater and the difference between the sum and `n` is even, it outputs `i`.

### Pseudocode

```
START

// Step 1: Accept user input and convert it to a non-negative integer
SET number AS absolute value of the integer from user input

// Step 2: Initialize a counter for the number of integers summed
SET index AS 0

// Step 3: Begin an infinite loop to compute the sum of integers
WHILE true DO:

    // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers
    SET sum AS (index multiplied by (index + 1)) divided by 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between the sum and the input number
    SET difference AS sum minus number

    // Step 4: Check if the sum equals the input number
    IF sum IS equal to number THEN:
        PRINT index // Output the current index
        BREAK // Exit the loop

    // Step 5: Check if the sum exceeds the input number
    ELSE IF sum IS greater than number THEN:
        // Check if the difference is even
        IF difference MODULO 2 IS equal to 0 THEN:
            PRINT index // Output the current index
            BREAK // Exit the loop
            
    // Increment the index for the next iteration
    INCREMENT index by 1

END
```

### Comments for Clarity
1. **Abs Value:** The code captures the absolute value to handle both positive and negative inputs uniformly.
2. **Sum Calculation:** The formula `(i*(i+1))//2` efficiently computes the sum of the first `i` integers.
3. **Conditions:** The loop continues until it finds a valid `index` satisfying the conditions: either total equals the input or the difference is even when the total exceeds the input.

### Example Structure
This pseudocode maintains a clear logical flow and descriptive variable names, making it understandable even for those less familiar with programming languages. The use of comments helps explain the rationale behind key decisions in the flow.
