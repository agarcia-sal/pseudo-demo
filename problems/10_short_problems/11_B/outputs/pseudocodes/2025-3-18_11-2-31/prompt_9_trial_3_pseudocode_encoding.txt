**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose triangular number is either equal to or greater than a given absolute input number, and to determine if the difference from the triangular number to the input number is even or not.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number.
   - Convert the input to an absolute value and store it as `inputNumber`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter `index` to 0.

3. **Continuous Loop:**
   - Start an infinite loop:
     1. Calculate the triangular number `triangularNumber` as the sum of the first `index` integers:
        - `triangularNumber` = (index Ã— (index + 1)) / 2
     2. Compute the difference `difference` between `triangularNumber` and `inputNumber`:
        - `difference` = `triangularNumber` - `inputNumber`
     3. **Check Conditions:**
        - If `triangularNumber` is equal to `inputNumber`:
          - Print `index`.
          - Exit the loop.
        - Else if `triangularNumber` is greater than `inputNumber`:
          - If `difference` is even:
            - Print `index`.
            - Exit the loop.
     4. Increment `index` by 1.

4. **End of Logic:**
   - The loop will continue until a condition for printing `index` is met.

**Output:** 
The program will print the smallest non-negative integer `index` meeting the specified conditions based on the input number provided.
