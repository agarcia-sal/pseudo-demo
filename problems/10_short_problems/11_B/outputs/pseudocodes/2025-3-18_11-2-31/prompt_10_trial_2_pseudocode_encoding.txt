Here is a clear and concise pseudocode version of the provided Python code, following the guided steps:

```plaintext
// Assume 'n' is a non-negative integer input by the user.
// Initialize 'i' as 0.

// Start an infinite loop
REPEAT 
    // Calculate the sum of the first 'i' natural numbers
    SET s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2

    // Calculate the difference between the calculated sum and 'n'
    SET m = s - n

    // Check if the sum equals 'n'
    IF s IS EQUAL TO n THEN
        PRINT i    // Output the value of 'i'
        BREAK

    // Check if the sum exceeds 'n'
    ELSE IF s IS GREATER THAN n THEN
        // Check if the difference 'm' is even
        IF m MOD 2 IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
            PRINT i    // Output the value of 'i'
            BREAK
        END IF
    END IF

    // Increment 'i' for the next iteration
    INCREMENT i BY 1
END REPEAT
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode Components:
1. **Input and Initialization**: The variable `n` is assumed to be a non-negative integer input by the user, and `i` starts at 0.
2. **Loop Structure**: The `REPEAT` structure indicates an infinite loop that continues until a `BREAK` statement is reached.
3. **Arithmetic Operations**: The sum calculation and difference are broken down into distinct steps for clarity.
4. **Conditionals**: If-else structures are clearly spelled out to reflect the conditions in the original code logically.
5. **Meaningful Identifiers**: The variable names are retained to maintain context, and the operations are expressed straightforwardly, making the logic clear. 

This pseudocode emphasizes clarity, readability, and structured logic without relying on programming-specific syntax.
