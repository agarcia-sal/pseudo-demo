**Purpose:**  
The goal of the program is to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` such that either the sum of the first `i` integers equals a given number or the difference between that sum and the number is even.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input:**  
   - Read a number from the user and store its absolute value as `targetNumber`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**  
   - Set `index` to 0 (this variable will represent the current integer we are checking).

3. **Loop to Find Valid Index:**  
   - Continue indefinitely (use an infinite loop) until a condition is met:
     - Calculate the sum of the first `index` integers, denoted as `currentSum`, using the formula:  
       `currentSum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`
     - Compute the difference between `currentSum` and `targetNumber`, denoted as `difference`.  
       `difference = currentSum - targetNumber`

     - **Check conditions:**
       - If `currentSum` equals `targetNumber`:
         - Output `index` (we found the desired integer).
         - Exit the loop.
       - Else if `currentSum` is greater than `targetNumber`:
         - If `difference` is even:
           - Output `index`.
           - Exit the loop.

     - Increment `index` by 1 to check the next integer.

**Explanation of Input and Output:**  
- **Input:** The user provides a single integer input, which is converted to its absolute value and assigned to `targetNumber`.
- **Output:** The program prints the smallest integer `i` that meets the defined conditions: either the sum of the first `i` integers equals `targetNumber` or the difference is an even number.

**Simplified Operations:**  
- The operation to calculate the sum of the first `i` integers is encapsulated in the formula, making it easy to understand.
- The use of a loop and straightforward conditional checks ensures the logic is simple and clear.

This pseudocode abstracts the original logic while accurately conveying how the program operates.
