**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**
   
2. **Input the number:**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number.
   - Convert the input to an integer, calculate its absolute value, and store it in a variable called `targetValue`.

3. **Initialize a counter:**
   - Set a variable `counter` to 0. This variable will help calculate triangular numbers.

4. **Begin an infinite loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely until a specific condition causes the loop to end:

     a. **Calculate the triangular number:**
        - Compute the sum of the first `counter` natural numbers (triangular number) and store it in a variable called `triangularNumber`. This is done using the formula: triangularNumber = (counter * (counter + 1)) divided by 2.

     b. **Calculate the difference:**
        - Determine the difference between `triangularNumber` and `targetValue`, and store it in a variable called `difference`.

     c. **Check for a match:**
        - If `triangularNumber` is exactly equal to `targetValue`:
          - Output the current value of `counter` and terminate the loop.

     d. **Check if triangular number exceeds targetValue:**
        - If `triangularNumber` is greater than `targetValue`:
          - Check if `difference` is an even number:
            - If it is even:
              - Output the current value of `counter` and terminate the loop.

     e. **Increment the counter:**
        - Increase the value of `counter` by 1 to compute the next triangular number in the next iteration.

5. **End the program.**
