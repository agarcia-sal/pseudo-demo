**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose sum of the first i natural numbers either equals a given input number or can be adjusted by an even number to equal that input number.

---

1. **Read Input**: Obtain a number from the user and convert it into a non-negative integer.

2. **Initialize Counter**: Set a counter variable to 0, which will be used to represent the current number i in our search.

3. **Loop Indefinitely**: Start an endless loop to check different values of i.

   a. **Calculate Sum**: Compute the sum of the first i natural numbers using the formula (i * (i + 1)) / 2.
   
   b. **Calculate Difference**: Determine the difference between this sum and the input number.
   
   c. **Check for Equality**: 
   
      - If the sum equals the input number, then print the value of i and end the program.
      
      - If the sum exceeds the input number, check the difference:
      
         i. If the difference is even, print the value of i and end the program.
         
4. **Increment Counter**: Increase the counter by 1 to evaluate the next natural number in the next iteration of the loop.

### Pseudocode Representation:

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Obtain input and convert to absolute integer
    INPUT userNumber
    absoluteValue = ABSOLUTE_VALUE(userNumber)

    // Step 2: Initialize counter
    counter = 0

    // Step 3: Loop to find the required integer
    WHILE TRUE DO
        // Step 3a: Calculate the sum of the first 'counter' numbers
        sum = (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2
        
        // Step 3b: Calculate the difference between sum and input number
        difference = sum - absoluteValue
        
        // Step 3c: Check if sum matches or exceeds input
        IF sum == absoluteValue THEN
            PRINT counter 
            BREAK // Exit loop
        ELSE IF sum > absoluteValue THEN
            // Step 3c.i: Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MOD 2 == 0 THEN
                PRINT counter
                BREAK // Exit loop
        END IF
        
        // Step 4: Increment counter for next iteration
        counter = counter + 1
    END WHILE
END
```

### Comments:
- The program uses a formula to efficiently calculate the sum of integers, rather than manually summing them.
- The use of modulus operation (MOD) to check if a number is even is an essential condition for determining if the adjustment can be made.
