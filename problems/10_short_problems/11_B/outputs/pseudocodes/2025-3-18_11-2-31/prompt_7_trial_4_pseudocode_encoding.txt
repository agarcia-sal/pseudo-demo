Here's the high-level pseudocode that accurately describes the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION findSmallestInteger(n)
    SET n AS the absolute value of the integer input from the user
    INITIALIZE i AS 0

    WHILE TRUE DO
        SET s AS the sum of the first i integers, calculated as (i * (i + 1)) / 2
        SET m AS the difference between s and n (m = s - n)

        IF s IS EQUAL TO n THEN
            PRINT i
            BREAK
        
        ELSE IF s IS GREATER THAN n THEN
            IF m IS EVEN THEN
                PRINT i
                BREAK
            END IF
        END IF

        INCREMENT i BY 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Context and Explanation:

1. **Purpose**: The code aims to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` such that the sum of the first `i` integers is equal to `n` or can be made equal to `n` by adjusting the sum by an even number.

2. **Input**: The function takes a single input, `n`, which is converted to its absolute integer value. 

3. **Output**: The function prints the smallest integer `i` that meets the specified conditions.

4. **Control Structures**: It employs an infinite loop that continues until a certain condition is met (either the sum equals `n` or can be adjusted to equal `n`), with if-else statements determining the flow based on comparisons.

This pseudocode captures the primary logic while providing a structured, clear representation that anyone can understand without needing to dive into the raw code.
