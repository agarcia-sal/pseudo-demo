**Pseudocode for Finding the Smallest Non-Negative Integer i for Which the Sum of Integers Equals or Exceeds n**

1. **Start**
2. **Input**: Read a number 'n' from the user and take its absolute value.
3. Initialize a variable 'i' to 0.
4. **Loop**: Repeat indefinitely until a break condition is met.
   1. **Calculate 's'**: 
      - Compute the sum of all integers from 0 to 'i', which is given by the formula `s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2`.
   2. **Compute 'm'**: 
      - Calculate `m` as `m = s - n`.
   3. **Check Conditions**:
      - **If** `s` is equal to `n`: 
        - Output the current value of 'i'.
        - Exit the loop.
      - **Else If** `s` is greater than `n`: 
        - **If** `m` is even: 
          - Output the current value of 'i'.
          - Exit the loop.
   4. Increment 'i' by 1.
5. **End** 

In summary, the algorithm calculates the sum of integers from 0 onward, checking each time if the sum matches or exceeds the absolute value of 'n'. It outputs the smallest 'i' that meets the criteria where either the sum equals 'n' or exceeds 'n' with an even difference from 'n'.
