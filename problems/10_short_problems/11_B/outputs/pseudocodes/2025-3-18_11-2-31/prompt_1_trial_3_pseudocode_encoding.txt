**Pseudocode for Computing a Specific Integer Based on User Input**

1. **Input:**
   - Read an integer value from the user and store the absolute value in `targetNumber`.

2. **Initialize:**
   - Set a counter `currentIndex` to 0.

3. **Loop:**
   - Repeat indefinitely (until a condition is met):
     1. Calculate the sum `sumOfFirstN` as the sum of the first `currentIndex` integers, using the formula `(currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2`.
     2. Calculate the difference `difference` by subtracting `targetNumber` from `sumOfFirstN`.
     
     3. **Check Conditions:**
        - If `sumOfFirstN` is equal to `targetNumber`:
          - Print `currentIndex` (this is the desired result).
          - Exit the loop.
        
        - Else if `sumOfFirstN` is greater than `targetNumber`:
          - If `difference` is even (i.e., `difference % 2` equals 0):
            - Print `currentIndex` (this is the desired result).
            - Exit the loop.

     4. Increment `currentIndex` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The output is the value of `currentIndex` when one of the above conditions is satisfied.
