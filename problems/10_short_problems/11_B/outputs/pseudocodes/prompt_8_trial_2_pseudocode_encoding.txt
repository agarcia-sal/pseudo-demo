### Purpose
The purpose of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer that either has a sum of the first few positive integers equal to a given number or can be adjusted by a certain even number to match that number.

### Pseudocode

1. **Get the Absolute Value of Input**
   - Read a number from the user.
   - Convert this number to its absolute value.
   - Store it in a variable named `targetNumber`.

2. **Initialize a Count Variable**
   - Set a variable `count` to 0. This will track how many integers we have summed.

3. **Start an Infinite Loop to Find Solution**
   - Continue looping indefinitely with the aim of finding a solution.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the First `count` Numbers**
   - Compute the sum of the first `count` integers.
   - This can be calculated as `sumOfIntegers = (count * (count + 1)) / 2`.

5. **Calculate the Difference from the Target Number**
   - Determine the difference by subtracting `targetNumber` from `sumOfIntegers`.
   - Store this difference in a variable called `difference`.

6. **Check Conditions for Output**
   - **If the sum equals the target number**:
     - Print the value of `count` (the current integer).
     - Exit the loop.
   - **If the sum exceeds the target number**:
     - **If the difference is even**:
       - Print the value of `count`.
       - Exit the loop.

7. **Increment the Count**
   - Increase the variable `count` by 1 to check the next integer in the subsequent loop iteration.

### Example of How the Program Works
- If the user inputs the number `3`, the calculation progresses as follows:
   - For `count = 0`: sum is `0` (not equal to `3`).
   - For `count = 1`: sum is `1` (not equal to `3`).
   - For `count = 2`: sum is `3` (it matches the target).
   - The program prints `2` and stops.

### Brief Comments
- The program calculates the sum of integers in sequence.
- It checks conditions based on that sum to find an appropriate count.
- The infinite loop is essential until a valid `count` is found.
