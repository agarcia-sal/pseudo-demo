Here's the pseudocode that translates the given code while following the specified guidelines:

```
BEGIN
    // Initialize variable n as the absolute value of the integer input
    SET n TO ABS(INT(INPUT("Enter a number: ")))

    // Initialize index variable i to 0
    SET i TO 0

    // Start an infinite loop
    WHILE TRUE DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers
        SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between sum s and number n
        SET m TO s - n
        
        // Check if the sum represents the number n
        IF s EQUALS n THEN
            PRINT "The value of i is: ", i
            BREAK // Exit the loop
                
        // Check if the sum is greater than n
        ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
            // Check if the difference m is even
            IF m MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT "The value of i is: ", i
                BREAK // Exit the loop
                
        // Increment the index i for the next iteration
        i = i + 1
END
```

### Assumptions:
1. The variable `n` is expected to be a non-negative integer, as it is derived from user input and its absolute value is taken.
2. The variable `i` is used as an index and will increase indefinitely until the loop is broken by one of the conditions.
3. The code assumes that input is provided correctly and can be evaluated as an integer.

### Clarifications:
- The prompt for user input has been added to specify where the user should enter a number.
- The results printed will indicate the value of `i` meeting the necessary conditions.
