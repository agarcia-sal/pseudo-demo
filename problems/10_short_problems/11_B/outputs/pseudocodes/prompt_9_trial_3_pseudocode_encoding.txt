**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to find and print a non-negative integer, `i`, such that the sum of the first `i` natural numbers is equal to a given non-negative integer `n`, or that the difference between this sum and `n` is an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input:**  
   - Read an integer input from the user and store it as a variable `n`.  
   - If `n` is negative, convert it to its absolute value.

2. **Initialize Counter:**  
   - Set a variable `i` to 0, which will be used to track the current integer.

3. **Loop until a condition is met:**  
   - Start an infinite loop.
     - Calculate the sum of the first `i` natural numbers and store it in a variable `sum_of_first_i`.  
       This can be calculated as:  
       \( \text{sum_of_first_i} = (i \cdot (i + 1)) / 2 \)
 
     - Calculate the difference between `sum_of_first_i` and `n`, and store it as a variable `difference`.  
       \( \text{difference} = \text{sum_of_first_i} - n \)
       
     - **Check if the sum equals n:**  
       - If `sum_of_first_i` is equal to `n`, print `i` and exit the loop.  
       
     - **Check if the sum is greater than n:**  
       - If `sum_of_first_i` is greater than `n`, then:
         - Check if the `difference` is an even number.
           - If `difference` is even, print `i` and exit the loop.
           
     - **Increment the counter:**  
       - Increase the value of `i` by 1.

4. **End of Program:**  
   - The program will terminate after printing the appropriate value of `i`.

**Final Note:** Ensure that the logic is followed correctly so that all cases are handled according to the requirements.
