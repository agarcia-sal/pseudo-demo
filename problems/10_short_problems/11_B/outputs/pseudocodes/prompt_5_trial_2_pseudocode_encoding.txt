**Purpose:** The primary goal of the code is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose triangular number either equals or exceeds a given absolute integer input, and if it exceeds, the difference must be even.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number.
   - Convert the number to an integer and take the absolute value.
   - Store this value in a variable called `target_value`.

2. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set an integer counter `index` to 0.

3. **Loop to Find Desired Triangular Number:**
   - Start an infinite loop (continue until a condition is met):
     - Calculate a triangular number using the formula: 
       - `triangular_number = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`
     - Compute the difference between the triangular number and the target value:
       - `difference = triangular_number - target_value`
     
     - **Check Conditions:**
       - If `triangular_number` is equal to `target_value`:
         - Print the current value of `index`.
         - Exit the loop.
       - Else if `triangular_number` is greater than `target_value`:
         - Check if `difference` is an even number:
           - If it is even:
             - Print the current value of `index`.
             - Exit the loop.
     
     - Increment the `index` by 1 to check the next number in the next iteration.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The triangular number is the sum of all integers from `1` to `index`.
- The loop continues until we either find a triangular number that exactly matches the user's input or exceeds it in such a way that the excess is even.

**Example Structure:**
```plaintext
BEGIN
  PROMPT user for input
  SET target_value to absolute value of user input
  SET index to 0

  WHILE true DO
    SET triangular_number to (index * (index + 1)) / 2
    SET difference to triangular_number - target_value
    
    IF triangular_number equals target_value THEN
      PRINT index
      BREAK
    ELSE IF triangular_number greater than target_value THEN
      IF difference is even THEN
        PRINT index
        BREAK
    END IF
    
    INCREMENT index by 1
  END WHILE
END
```

**Iteration for Improvement:**
- Reviewed the pseudocode for logical flow, clarity, and adherence to the laid-out steps; ensuring the instructions are easy to follow and suitable for an audience unfamiliar with programming syntax while still capturing the essence of the original code.
