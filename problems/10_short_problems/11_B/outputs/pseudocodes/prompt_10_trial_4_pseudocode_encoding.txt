Here's the pseudocode based on the given code following the guided steps:

```
1. Initialize variable n to the absolute value of the integer input from the user.
2. Initialize variable i to 0.

3. Start an infinite loop:
   a. Set variable s to the sum of the first i natural numbers using the formula s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2.
   b. Set variable m to s - n.

   c. If s equals n:
      i. Print the value of i.
      ii. Exit the loop.

   d. Else if s is greater than n:
      i. If m is divisible by 2:
         - Print the value of i.
         - Exit the loop.

   e. Increment the value of i by 1.
```

### Assumptions:
- The input provided is a valid integer.
- The calculation for the absolute value and integer conversion is successful before initializing `n`.
- The program is capable of running indefinitely until one of the exit conditions is met.
