### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading a user input and taking its absolute value.
2. **Loop and Counter**: It then initializes a counter and enters an infinite loop where it continuously calculates the sum of numbers from 0 to the current counter.
3. **Conditional Checks**: Inside the loop, it checks whether the calculated sum matches or exceeds the input number. It uses the difference to determine if it can be evenly partitioned when exceeded.
4. **Output**: The results are printed based on the conditions met, and the loop is terminated appropriately.
