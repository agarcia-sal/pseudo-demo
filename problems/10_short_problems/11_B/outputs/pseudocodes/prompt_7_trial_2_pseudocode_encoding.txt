Here is a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION findIntegerWhereSumEqualsInput()
    // Prompt user for input and convert it into a positive integer
    INPUT number
    SET absoluteValue = absolute(number)

    // Initialize a counter variable
    SET index = 0
    
    // Begin an infinite loop to search for the desired integer
    WHILE TRUE DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers using the formula for the sum of a series
        SET sum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and the user input
        SET difference = sum - absoluteValue
        
        // Check if the current sum is equal to the given number
        IF sum EQUALS absoluteValue THEN
            PRINT index // Print the found index
            BREAK // Exit the loop
        
        // Check if the current sum is greater than the absolute value of the input
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN absoluteValue THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT index // Print the found index
                BREAK // Exit the loop

        // Increment the index to check the next integer
        index = index + 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Contextual Overview:
1. **Purpose:** The function calculates the smallest non-negative integer such that either its sum of the first 'index' integers equals a given absolute input number or can be adjusted by an even difference to meet the requirement.
   
2. **Input & Output:**
   - **Input:** A number (which may be negative).
   - **Output:** The smallest index (non-negative integer) which meets the condition relative to the absolute input.

3. **Logic Flow:**
   - A loop continues indefinitely until the correct index is found.
   - The sum formula calculates the sum of integers from 0 to `index`, checking against the absolute value of the input.
   - Conditions govern whether the current sum matches or exceeds the input, leading to potential output.

### Notes:
- The pseudocode maintains higher-level abstraction by replacing specific implementation details with more generalized operations.
- Variable names are chosen to ensure clarity while preserving the logic of the original code.
