```
# Start of the program
Get the absolute value of an integer from user input and store in variable 'n'
Initialize variable 'i' to 0

# Infinite loop to find a solution
Repeat indefinitely:
    # Calculate the sum of the first 'i' natural numbers
    Set 's' to the sum of numbers from 0 to 'i' (s = i * (i + 1) / 2)
    Set 'm' to the difference between 's' and 'n' (m = s - n)

    # Check if the current sum 's' equals 'n'
    If 's' equals 'n':
        Output 'i' (the current value of i)
        Exit the loop

    # Check if the current sum 's' exceeds 'n'
    Else if 's' is greater than 'n':
        # Check if the difference 'm' is even
        If 'm' is even:
            Output 'i' (the current value of i)
            Exit the loop

    # Increment 'i' for the next iteration
    Increment 'i' by 1
# End of the program
