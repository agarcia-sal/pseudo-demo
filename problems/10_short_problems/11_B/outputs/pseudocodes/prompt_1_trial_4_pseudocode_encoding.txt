**Pseudocode: Find an Integer Based on the Sum of Natural Numbers**

```
1. Read an integer input from the user and store its absolute value in variable 'distanceFromSum'.

2. Initialize a variable 'index' to zero.

3. Start an infinite loop:
    a. Calculate the sumOfFirstN using the formula for the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers: 
       sumOfFirstN = (index * (index + 1)) / 2

    b. Calculate the differenceFromTarget as: 
       differenceFromTarget = sumOfFirstN - distanceFromSum

    c. Check if sumOfFirstN is equal to distanceFromSum:
        - If true, print 'index' and exit the loop.

    d. Check if sumOfFirstN is greater than distanceFromSum:
        - If true, then check if differenceFromTarget is an even number:
            - If true, print 'index' and exit the loop.

    e. Increment 'index' by 1.
```

**Explanation:**
- This pseudocode represents a process to find a non-negative integer 'index' such that either the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers is equal to a given number or the difference between that sum and the given number is even when the sum exceeds the number.
- The algorithm uses a loop to incrementally compute the sum of natural numbers until one of the conditions is met.
