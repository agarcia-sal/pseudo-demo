**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose sum of the first 'i' natural numbers either equals a given non-negative integer or exceeds it by an even number.

**Variables:**
- `targetNumber`: A non-negative integer input from the user.
- `currentInteger`: An integer that starts at 0 and increases to find a solution.
- `sumOfIntegers`: The cumulative sum of integers from 0 to `currentInteger`.
- `difference`: The difference between `sumOfIntegers` and `targetNumber`.

**Algorithm:**
1. Get the absolute value of the user input and assign it to `targetNumber`.
2. Initialize `currentInteger` to 0.
3. Start an infinite loop:
   - Calculate `sumOfIntegers` as the sum of all integers from 0 to `currentInteger`.
   - Calculate `difference` as the difference between `sumOfIntegers` and `targetNumber`.
   - If `sumOfIntegers` is equal to `targetNumber`, then:
     - Output `currentInteger` and exit the loop.
   - If `sumOfIntegers` is greater than `targetNumber`, then:
     - If `difference` is an even number, then:
       - Output `currentInteger` and exit the loop.
   - Increment `currentInteger` by 1.

**Input and Output:**
- **Input:** A single non-negative integer value from the user.
- **Output:** The smallest non-negative integer that, when summing the first 'i' natural numbers, either equals or exceeds the input by an even amount.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Prompt the user for input and convert it to an absolute integer value (`targetNumber`).
2. Initialize `currentInteger` to 0.
3. Continuously compute the sum of integers from 0 up to `currentInteger`:
   - Calculate `sumOfIntegers` using the formula for the sum of the first `currentInteger` integers.
4. Check if the calculated `sumOfIntegers` is equal to `targetNumber`:
   - If yes, print `currentInteger` and stop the algorithm.
5. Check if `sumOfIntegers` exceeds `targetNumber`:
   - If so, check if the difference is even:
     - If the difference is even, print `currentInteger` and stop the algorithm.
6. If no conditions are met, increment `currentInteger` and repeat the process.

**Final Review:** This pseudocode maintains the integrity of the original logic while providing a clear and structured representation suitable for understanding by individuals familiar with basic programming concepts. All operations and conditions are simplified without losing the algorithm's purpose and functionality.
