Here's the pseudocode representing the logic of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION findNumberMatchingCondition()
    // Get the absolute value of input and convert it to an integer
    SET userInput TO absolute value of integer(input)
    
    // Initialize the counter variable
    SET index TO 0
    
    // Loop indefinitely until a break condition is met
    WHILE TRUE DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
        SET sum TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between 'sum' and 'userInput'
        SET difference TO sum - userInput
        
        // Check if the sum equals the user input
        IF sum EQUALS userInput THEN
            PRINT index
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the sum exceeds the user input
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN userInput THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT index
                BREAK
        
        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        index INCREMENT BY 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The function takes user input, computes its absolute value, and stores it in a variable.
2. **Looping Mechanism:** Using an infinite loop (`WHILE TRUE`), it continues processing until a break condition is satisfied.
3. **Summation Logic:** For each iteration, it calculates the sum of the first `index` numbers using the formula for the triangular number.
4. **Condition Checking:**
   - It checks if this computed sum matches the user input.
   - If it exceeds the user input, it checks if the difference is even.
5. **Output:** When a matching condition is found, the current index is printed and the loop is exited (`BREAK`).
6. **Increment:** The index is incremented at the end of each iteration to analyze the next natural number in the following loop iteration.

The pseudocode retains the logic of the original code, articulating it in a more intuitive and high-level format, suitable for understanding without specifics of any programming language syntax.
