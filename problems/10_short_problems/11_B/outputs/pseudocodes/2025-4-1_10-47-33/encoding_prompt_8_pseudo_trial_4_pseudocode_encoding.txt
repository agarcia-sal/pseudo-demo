**Objective:** The purpose of the code is to find the first non-negative integer such that the sum of the first 'i' integers either equals a given positive integer 'n' or the difference between this sum and 'n' is an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Input**:
   - Get an absolute integer input value 'n' from the user.

2. **Set Initial Values**:
   - Set a variable 'index' to 0.

3. **Repeat Until Found**:
   - Create an infinite loop that continues until a solution is found.

4. **Calculate Sum**:
   - Calculate 'sumUpToIndex' as the sum of the first 'index' integers using the formula:  
     `sumUpToIndex = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`

5. **Determine the Difference**:
   - Calculate the difference 'difference' as:  
     `difference = sumUpToIndex - n`

6. **Check for Equality**:
   - If 'sumUpToIndex' is equal to 'n':
     - Print the current 'index'.
     - Exit the loop.

7. **Check for Greater Than Condition**:
   - If 'sumUpToIndex' is greater than 'n':
     - Check if 'difference' is even (i.e., if 'difference' modulo 2 equals 0).
       - If true, then print the current 'index' and exit the loop.

8. **Increment Index**:
   - Increase 'index' by 1 to check the next integer.

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The code calculates the cumulative sum of integers starting from 0, checking at each step whether this sum matches the input 'n' or whether the difference from 'n' is even.
- The use of an infinite loop allows for continual checking until a satisfactory 'index' is identified.

This pseudocode simplifies the original logic and makes it accessible for someone familiar with basic programming concepts but not necessarily familiar with the specific syntax of the original code.
