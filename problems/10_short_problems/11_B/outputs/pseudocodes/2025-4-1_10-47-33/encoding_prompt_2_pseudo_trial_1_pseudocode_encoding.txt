**Pseudocode:**

1. Start
2. Read an integer value from the user and take its absolute value. Store this value in a variable named `targetNumber`.
3. Initialize a variable `currentIndex` to 0.
4. Enter an infinite loop:
   - Calculate the sum of the first `currentIndex` natural numbers and store it in a variable named `currentSum`.
   - Determine the difference between `currentSum` and `targetNumber` and store it in a variable named `difference`.
   
   - If `currentSum` is equal to `targetNumber`:
     - Display `currentIndex` as the result.
     - Exit the loop.
   - Else if `currentSum` is greater than `targetNumber`:
     - Check if `difference` is an even number:
       - If it is even, display `currentIndex` as the result.
       - Exit the loop.
   
   - Increment `currentIndex` by 1.
5. End. 

**Input:** An integer number provided by the user.

**Output:** The value of `currentIndex` that meets the specified conditions.
