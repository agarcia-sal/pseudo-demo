Here is the pseudocode representation of the provided code snippet, structured for clarity and understanding:

```
BEGIN

    // Take an integer input from the user and store its absolute value
    SET absoluteValue TO absolute(int(RECEIVE input from user))

    // Initialize a counter variable for the iterative process
    SET counter TO 0

    // Start an infinite loop to calculate triangular numbers
    WHILE TRUE DO
        
        // Calculate the triangular number for the current counter position
        SET triangularNumber TO (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the triangular number and the input value
        SET difference TO triangularNumber - absoluteValue
        
        // Check if the triangular number is exactly equal to the input value
        IF triangularNumber EQUALS absoluteValue THEN
            // Print the current counter as the result
            PRINT counter
            // Exit the loop as the result is found
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the triangular number exceeds the input value
        ELSE IF triangularNumber GREATER THAN absoluteValue THEN
            
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                // Print the current counter as the result
                PRINT counter
                // Exit the loop as the result is found
                BREAK
        
        // Increment the counter to check the next triangular number
        INCREMENT counter
        
    END WHILE

END
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling:** It starts with obtaining an input value and ensuring it's non-negative by taking its absolute value.
  
2. **Loop for Triangular Numbers:** A loop generates triangular numbers based on the counter and checks specific conditions against the provided input.

3. **Conditions & Output:** The script checks if the triangular number is equal to the absolute input or greater than it. If it's greater, it checks if the difference is even, printing the counter if any of these conditions are met, followed by breaking the loop.

4. **Counter Incrementing:** The counter is incremented in each loop iteration to move to the next triangular number.

This pseudocode retains the logical sequence of the original code while eliminating specific programming syntax and emphasizing clarity and intent.
