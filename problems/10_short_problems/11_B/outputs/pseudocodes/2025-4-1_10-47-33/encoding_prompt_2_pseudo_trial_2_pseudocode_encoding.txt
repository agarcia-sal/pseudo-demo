**Pseudocode: Find Triangle Number Index**

**Input:**
- A positive integer value, n, provided by the user.

**Process:**
1. Convert the user input into a positive integer and store it in a variable named `targetTriangleNumber`.
2. Initialize a variable `index` to zero, which will keep track of the current index being evaluated.
3. Enter an infinite loop to continuously evaluate potential triangle numbers.
   - Within the loop:
     a. Calculate the triangle number corresponding to `index` using the formula: `triangleNumber = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`.
     b. Compute the difference between the calculated triangle number and the `targetTriangleNumber`, storing the result in a variable named `difference`.
     
     c. Check if the calculated triangle number is equal to `targetTriangleNumber`:
        - If they are equal, output the current `index` and terminate the loop.
     
     d. If the calculated triangle number is greater than `targetTriangleNumber`:
        - Check if the `difference` is an even number:
          - If it is even, output the current `index` and terminate the loop.
     
     e. Increment the `index` by one to evaluate the next triangle number in the next iteration of the loop.

**Output:**
- The program will output the value of `index` at which the `targetTriangleNumber` is found or the condition is satisfied, indicating the position of the corresponding triangle number.
