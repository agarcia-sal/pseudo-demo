**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose triangular number is equal to or exceeds a given input number, and if it exceeds, to check if the difference is even before confirming the result.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive and Prepare Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input a number.
   - Convert the input to a non-negative integer and store it as `targetNumber`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set `currentIndex` to 0.

3. **Process to Find the Desired Index:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:
     - Calculate the triangular number `triangularNumber` using the formula:
       - `triangularNumber` equals (currentIndex multiplied by (currentIndex plus 1)) divided by 2.
     - Calculate the difference `difference` as:
       - `difference` equals `triangularNumber` minus `targetNumber`.
     - Check if the `triangularNumber` equals `targetNumber`:
       - If true, print `currentIndex` (this is the answer) and exit the loop.
     - Otherwise, check if the `triangularNumber` is greater than `targetNumber`:
       - If true, check if `difference` is even (if `difference` modulo 2 equals 0):
         - If true, print `currentIndex` (this is the answer) and exit the loop.
     - Increment `currentIndex` by 1.

This pseudocode effectively captures the logic of the original code without specific programming syntax, ensuring clarity and coherence for readers.
