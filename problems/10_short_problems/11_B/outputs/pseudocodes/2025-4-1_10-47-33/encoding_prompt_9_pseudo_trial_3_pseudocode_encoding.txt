**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this code is to determine the smallest non-negative integer, when summed in sequence from zero to that integer, either equals a given number or exceeds it by an even amount.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input a number.
   - Convert the input to an absolute integer value and store it in a variable named `targetValue`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0, which will serve as a counter.

3. **Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:
     1. **Calculate Sum:**
        - Calculate the sum of integers from 0 to the current `index` and store it in a variable named `currentSum`.
        - This is done by using the formula:  
          `currentSum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`
     2. **Calculate Difference:**
        - Compute the difference `diff` between `currentSum` and `targetValue`.  
          `diff = currentSum - targetValue`
     3. **Check for Equality:**
        - If `currentSum` equals `targetValue`:
          - Output the value of `index` (the current integer).
          - Exit the loop.
     4. **Check for Greater Sum:**
        - If `currentSum` is greater than `targetValue`:
          - If `diff` is even (the remainder when `diff` is divided by 2 is zero):
            - Output the value of `index`.
            - Exit the loop.
     5. **Increment Index:**
        - Increase the value of `index` by 1.

**Output:**  
- The output will be the smallest non-negative integer for which the cumulative sum either equals the target value or exceeds it by an even number. 

This pseudocode effectively abstracts the original code's logic into a clear, human-readable format while preserving the core functionality and flow of the algorithm.
