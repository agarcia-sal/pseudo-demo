**Pseudocode:**

1. Start the program.
2. Receive an integer input from the user and take its absolute value. Store this value as targetNumber.
3. Initialize a counter variable, currentIndex, to 0.
4. Enter an infinite loop to perform the following steps:
   a. Calculate the sum, sumValue, of all integers from 0 to currentIndex using the formula (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) divided by 2.
   b. Determine the difference, differenceFromTarget, between sumValue and targetNumber.
   c. Check if sumValue is equal to targetNumber:
      - If it is, print currentIndex and exit the loop.
   d. If sumValue is greater than targetNumber, check if differenceFromTarget is even:
      - If it is, print currentIndex and exit the loop.
   e. Increment currentIndex by 1.
5. End the program. 

**Input:** A single integer from the user, which is converted to its absolute value.
**Output:** The integer currentIndex that satisfies the condition based on the calculations.
