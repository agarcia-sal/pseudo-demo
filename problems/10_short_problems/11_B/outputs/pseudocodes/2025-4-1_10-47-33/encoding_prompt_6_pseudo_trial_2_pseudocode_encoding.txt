Here is the translated pseudocode that accurately reflects the logic of the original code while maintaining readability:

```
START

// Get the absolute value of a number input from the user
INPUT userInput
number n = ABSOLUTE(userInput)
integer i = 0  // Initialize an index variable

WHILE TRUE DO
    // Calculate the sum of the first i integers
    integer sumOfFirsti = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between the sum and n
    integer difference = sumOfFirsti - n
    
    // Check if the sum equals n
    IF sumOfFirsti IS EQUAL TO n THEN
        PRINT(i)  // Print the value of i
        EXIT  // Exit the loop

    // Check if the sum is greater than n
    ELSE IF sumOfFirsti IS GREATER THAN n THEN
        // Check if the difference is even
        IF difference IS EVEN THEN
            PRINT(i)  // Print the value of i
            EXIT  // Exit the loop

    // Increment i for the next iteration
    i = i + 1

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. The program starts by taking user input and converting it to an absolute value.
2. An index variable `i` is initialized to zero.
3. A loop begins, where the sum of the first `i` integers is calculated.
4. The difference between this sum and `n` is computed.
5. If the sum matches `n`, it prints `i` and exits.
6. If the sum exceeds `n`, it checks if the difference is even. If it is, it also prints `i` and exits.
7. If none of the conditions are met, it increments `i` and repeats the process. 

This clear structuring helps anyone understand the algorithm's purpose and functionality without needing specific programming knowledge.
