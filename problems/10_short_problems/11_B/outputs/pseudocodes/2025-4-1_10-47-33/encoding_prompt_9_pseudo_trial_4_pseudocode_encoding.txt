**Purpose:** 
The goal of this algorithm is to find the largest integer that can represent the number of sequentially summed integers (starting from 1) that yield a given absolute input number, or determine if a combination of these sums can equate to the input number by allowing a certain manipulation.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive input:**
   - Get a number from the user, take its absolute value, and store it in a variable named `targetValue`.

2. **Initialize a counter:**
   - Set an integer `counter` to 0.

3. **Begin an infinite loop:**
   - Repeat indefinitely until a break condition is met.

4. **Calculate the sum of integers:**
   - Compute the sum of the first `counter` integers and store it in a variable named `currentSum`. 
     - `currentSum` = `counter` * (`counter` + 1) / 2

5. **Calculate the difference:**
   - Calculate the difference between `currentSum` and `targetValue` and store it in a variable named `difference`. 
     - `difference` = `currentSum` - `targetValue`

6. **Check equality:**
   - If `currentSum` equals `targetValue`, then:
     - Output `counter` as the solution and end the loop.

7. **Check exceedance condition:**
   - If `currentSum` is greater than `targetValue`, then:
     - If `difference` is even (divisible by 2), then:
       - Output `counter` as the solution and end the loop.

8. **Increment counter:**
   - Increase `counter` by 1.

9. **End of pseudocode.**

**Summary of Input and Output:**
- **Input:** An integer from the user, which is considered in its absolute form.
- **Output:** An integer representing the result, either the largest completed sum index or the closest possible sum index if a difference is even.

**Final Check:**
- The constructed pseudocode effectively outlines the primary logic and flow of the original code, preserving the functionality while ensuring clarity and accessibility.
