**Purpose:**  
The goal of the algorithm is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose sum of consecutive integers from 0 up to that integer either equals or exceeds a given absolute input number and can adjust to match that number through a specific calculation.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input:**  
   Receive a number from the user and calculate its absolute value. Store this value in a variable named `targetSum`.

2. **Initialize Counter:**  
   Set a variable named `currentIndex` to 0. This will keep track of the current integer being evaluated.

3. **Loop Indefinitely:**  
   Begin an infinite loop to evaluate consecutive integers.

   - a. **Calculate Sum:**  
      Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to `currentIndex` and store this in a variable named `currentSum`. This is done using the formula:
      - `currentSum = currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1) / 2`
      
   - b. **Difference Calculation:**  
      Calculate the difference between `currentSum` and `targetSum`. Store this difference in a variable named `difference`. This is represented as:
      - `difference = currentSum - targetSum`

   - c. **Check for Exact Match:**  
      If `currentSum` is equal to `targetSum`, then:
      - Output `currentIndex` as the result, indicating this is the smallest integer meeting the criteria.
      - Terminate the loop.

   - d. **Check for Overshoot:**  
      If `currentSum` is greater than `targetSum`, then:
      - If `difference` is even (i.e., divisible by 2), then:
         - Output `currentIndex` as the result, indicating this integer can adjust to match the target sum.
         - Terminate the loop.

   - e. **Increment Index:**  
      Increase `currentIndex` by 1 to evaluate the next integer in the next loop iteration.

4. **End of Algorithm:**  
   The loop will continue until a suitable integer has been found and outputted.

**Summary of Input and Output:**
- Input: A numeric value from the user, which is converted to an absolute integer.
- Output: The smallest non-negative integer that either equals the sum of integers from 0 up to it or can achieve this by adjusting based on the difference.
