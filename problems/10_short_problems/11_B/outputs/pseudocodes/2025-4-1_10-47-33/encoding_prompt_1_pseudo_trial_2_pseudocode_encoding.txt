**Pseudocode: Calculate the Maximum Integer for a Given Condition**

1. **Input Handling**
   - Read a number from the user and store its absolute value in a variable called `absoluteInput`.

2. **Initialize a Counter**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the current integer.

3. **Infinite Loop for Calculation**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:
     1. Calculate the sum of the first `index` integers using the formula: 
        - `currentSum` = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
     2. Calculate the difference between `currentSum` and `absoluteInput`:
        - `difference` = `currentSum` - `absoluteInput`
     
     3. **Check Conditions**
        - If `currentSum` is equal to `absoluteInput`, then:
          - Output the value of `index` as the result.
          - Exit the loop.
        - If `currentSum` is greater than `absoluteInput`, then:
          - If `difference` is an even number, then:
            - Output the value of `index` as the result.
            - Exit the loop.
   
     4. **Increment the Counter**
        - Increase `index` by 1 to consider the next integer.

4. **End of Program**
   - The program ends when a valid output is produced. Output indicates the maximum integer satisfying the conditions based on the input.
