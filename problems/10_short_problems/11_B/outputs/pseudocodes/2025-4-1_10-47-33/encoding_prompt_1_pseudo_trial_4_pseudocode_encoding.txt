**Pseudocode:**

1. Begin the program.
2. Get an input value from the user and convert it to an absolute integer. Store this value in a variable named "inputNumber".
3. Initialize a counter variable "index" to 0.
4. Start an infinite loop:
    1. Calculate the sum "sumOfIntegers" as the total of all integers from 0 to "index". This is done using the formula (index * (index + 1)) / 2.
    2. Calculate "difference" by subtracting "inputNumber" from "sumOfIntegers".
    3. Check if "sumOfIntegers" is equal to "inputNumber":
        - If true, print the value of "index" and exit the loop.
    4. Otherwise, if "sumOfIntegers" is greater than "inputNumber":
        - Check if the "difference" is an even number:
            - If true, print the value of "index" and exit the loop.
    5. Increment "index" by 1.
5. End the program. 

**Summary:**
This pseudocode represents an algorithm that continuously computes the sum of integers until it finds an index such that the sum either equals an absolute input number or exceeds it by an even amount. When either condition is satisfied, it outputs the index and terminates.
