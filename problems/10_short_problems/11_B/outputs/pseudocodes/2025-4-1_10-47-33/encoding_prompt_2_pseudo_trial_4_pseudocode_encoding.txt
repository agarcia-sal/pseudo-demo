**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
  
2. **Input:** Read an integer from the user and store the absolute value in a variable named `targetSum`.

3. **Initialize:** Set a variable `currentIndex` to 0.

4. **Loop:** Begin an infinite loop that will continue until explicitly broken.
   
   4.1. **Calculate:** Determine the sum of the first `currentIndex` integers using the formula: `currentSum = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) divided by 2`.

   4.2. **Calculate Difference:** Find the difference between `currentSum` and `targetSum` and store it in a variable called `differenceFromTarget`.

   4.3. **Check for Exact Match:** 
       - If `currentSum` is equal to `targetSum`, then:
         - Output the value of `currentIndex`.
         - Exit the loop.

   4.4. **Check for Exceeding Target:** 
       - If `currentSum` is greater than `targetSum`, then:
         - Check if `differenceFromTarget` is even:
           - If it is even, then:
             - Output the value of `currentIndex`.
             - Exit the loop.
  
   4.5. **Increment:** Increase `currentIndex` by 1.

5. **End of Loop**

6. **End**
