**Purpose Summary:**  
The purpose of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer that, when the sum of all integers up to that number is calculated, either equals a given positive integer or exceeds it in such a way that the difference is even.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Variables**:  
   Set a variable for the absolute value of the input number, which we will call "targetNumber".  
   Set an index variable, "index", to 0.

2. **Start Infinite Loop**:  
   Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

   a. **Calculate the Sum**:  
      Calculate "sumToIndex" as the sum of all integers from 0 to "index". This can be done using the formula:  
      sumToIndex = (index * (index + 1)) / 2  
   
   b. **Calculate the Difference**:  
      Determine the difference between "sumToIndex" and "targetNumber". Letâ€™s call this "difference":  
      difference = sumToIndex - targetNumber  

   c. **Check for Exact Match**:  
      If "sumToIndex" is equal to "targetNumber", then:  
         - Print "index" (the current number)  
         - Exit the loop  

   d. **Check for Exceeding Value**:  
      If "sumToIndex" is greater than "targetNumber", then:  
         - If the "difference" is even (meaning the remainder when "difference" is divided by 2 equals 0), then:  
            - Print "index"  
            - Exit the loop  

   e. **Increment Index**:  
      Increase the value of "index" by 1.

**Comments for Clarity:**  
- The sum of integers up to a certain number is computed using a mathematical formula to ensure efficiency.  
- The loop continues until either the exact target is found or a suitable condition (the difference being even) is met.  
- The decision-making checks for equality and conditions for exceeding are essential in determining when to break out of the loop.

By following this structured approach, you can trace the logic and functionality of the original code without needing to reference specific programming syntax.
