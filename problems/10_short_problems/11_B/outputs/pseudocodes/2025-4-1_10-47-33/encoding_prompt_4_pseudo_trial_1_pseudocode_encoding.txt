# Start by taking the absolute value of user input and convert it to an integer
n = absolute_value_of(input_as_integer())

# Initialize a variable to keep track of the current number
i = 0

# Start an infinite loop for finding the required number
while true:
    # Calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers
    s = sum_of_first_i_numbers(i)
    
    # Determine how much s exceeds n
    m = s - n
    
    # Check if the sum equals n
    if s equals n:
        output(i)  # Print the current number i
        stop the loop
    
    # Check if the sum exceeds n
    elif s greater than n:
        # Check if the difference m is even
        if m is even:
            output(i)  # Print the current number i
            stop the loop
    
    # Increment i for the next iteration
    i = i + 1

# Function to calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers
function sum_of_first_i_numbers(i):
    return (i * (i + 1)) / 2

# Function to get the absolute value of the input integer
function absolute_value_of(num):
    if num < 0:
        return -num
    return num
```

**Comments:**
- The pseudocode clearly outlines the logic for determining how many natural numbers to sum until either the sum equals the input number or the conditions for exceeding the number are met.
- Functions have been defined to abstract complicated calculations and enhance readability.
- Control structures like loops and conditionals are expressed clearly for easy understanding.
