**Pseudocode for the Given Code:**

1. **Start the program**
2. **Get the absolute value of user input as an integer, assign it to `n`**
3. **Initialize `i` to 0**
4. **Enter an infinite loop**
    1. **Calculate the sum `s` of the first `i` natural numbers**  
        (This can be done using the formula: `s = i * (i + 1) / 2`)
    2. **Calculate the difference `m` between `s` and `n`**  
        (This represents how far `s` is from `n`: `m = s - n`)
    3. **Check if `s` is equal to `n`**
       - If they are equal, print the value of `i` and exit the loop
    4. **Check if `s` is greater than `n`**
       - If this condition holds true, then check if `m` is even
           - If `m` is even, print the value of `i` and exit the loop
    5. **Increment `i` by 1**
5. **End of program** 

**Output:** The value of `i` when either condition of equality or even difference is met.
