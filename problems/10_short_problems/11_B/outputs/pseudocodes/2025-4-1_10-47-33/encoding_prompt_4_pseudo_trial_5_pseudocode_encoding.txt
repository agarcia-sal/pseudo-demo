### Explanation:
- The pseudocode begins with a function definition that indicates its purpose of finding a specific triangle number related to the input.
- The input is converted to an absolute integer and stored in `n`.
- A loop is initiated to compute triangle numbers incrementally using `i`.
- The triangle number (`s`) is calculated and used to determine whether it matches the target (`n`) or if it exceeds it, allowing the program to handle conditions based on evenness.
- The loop continues until a suitable triangle number is printed, at which point it breaks out of the loop.
