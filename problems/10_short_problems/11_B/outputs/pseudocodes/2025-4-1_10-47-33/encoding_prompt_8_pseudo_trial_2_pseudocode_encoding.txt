**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer, referred to as `i`, such that the sum of the first `i` integers equals a given number `n`, or that the difference between this sum and `n` is an even number.

**Pseudocode**:
```
START

// Step 1: Get input from the user
SET number AS absolute value of the integer(input)  // Take absolute value of the user's input number

// Step 2: Initialize a variable to keep track of the current integer
SET currentInteger AS 0

// Step 3: Enter an infinite loop to search for the desired integer
WHILE true DO
    // Calculate the sum of the first 'currentInteger' integers
    SET sum AS (currentInteger * (currentInteger + 1)) / 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between 'sum' and 'number'
    SET difference AS sum - number
    
    // Step 4: Check if the sum equals the user's number
    IF sum IS EQUAL TO number THEN
        PRINT currentInteger  // Output the current integer
        BREAK  // Exit the loop
    
    // Step 5: Check if sum is greater than the user's number
    ELSE IF sum IS GREATER THAN number THEN
        // Check if the difference is even
        IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
            PRINT currentInteger  // Output the current integer
            BREAK  // Exit the loop
    
    // Step 6: Increment the current integer for the next iteration
    INCREMENT currentInteger BY 1  // Move to the next integer

END
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The program begins by taking an integer input from the user and converting it to its absolute value since negative inputs are not considered in this context.
- The sum is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `i` integers, which is derived from basic arithmetic series principles.
- The loop continues indefinitely until the desired condition is met, at which point the program outputs the integer and terminates.
- The use of conditions allows the program to determine whether to print the current integer based on either the exact match of the sum or if the surplus from the sum is even.
