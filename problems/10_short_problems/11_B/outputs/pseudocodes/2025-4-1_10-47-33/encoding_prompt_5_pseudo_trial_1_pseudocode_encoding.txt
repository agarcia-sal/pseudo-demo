**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to find a non-negative integer that, when its sum of the first `i` integers is equal to or exceeds a given absolute integer, allows for the difference to be even. If a perfect match is found, it will print that integer.

**Pseudocode:**

```
1. Start the program

2. Read an integer input from the user
   - Set the variable userInput to the absolute value of the input integer

3. Initialize a variable index to 0 (this will represent the current integer we are examining)

4. Create an infinite loop to continue examining integers
   - Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers
     - Let sum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
   - Calculate a difference value
     - Let difference = sum - userInput

   5. Check if the sum equals userInput
      - If it does, then print index as the solution
      - End the program

   6. Otherwise, check if the sum is greater than userInput
      - If it is,
        - Check if the difference is even (difference mod 2 equals 0)
        - If the difference is even, print index as the solution
        - End the program

   7. Increment the index by 1 to check the next integer
   - Repeat the loop

8. End the program
```

**Comments:**
- The program initiates with user input and ensures it is positive by taking the absolute value.
- An infinite loop is used to systematically check each integer (index) and find a match based on specific conditions.
- The calculation of the sum of integers up to `index` is done using a mathematical formula to ensure efficiency.
- The condition checks for an exact match or the possibility of a valid even difference, providing outputs accordingly.
