**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to find a non-negative integer \( i \) such that the sum of the first \( i \) integers equals a given non-negative integer \( n \) or the difference between this sum and \( n \) is an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Input the Number:**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number.
   - Read the input and convert it to an absolute integer.
   - Assign the absolute integer to a variable called `targetSum`.

3. **Initialize Counter:**
   - Set a counter variable `index` to 0.

4. **Begin Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

   a. **Calculate the Sum of the First 'index' Integers:**
      - Calculate the sum of the first `index` integers and assign it to a variable called `currentSum`.
      - The formula for this is: `currentSum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`.

   b. **Calculate the Difference:**
      - Determine the difference between `currentSum` and `targetSum`. Assign this difference to a variable called `difference`.
      - This is calculated as: `difference = currentSum - targetSum`.

   c. **Check for Equality:**
      - If `currentSum` is equal to `targetSum`:
          - Print `index` (this is the result we are looking for).
          - Exit the loop.
          
   d. **Check for Exceeding the Target:**
      - If `currentSum` is greater than `targetSum`:
          - Check if `difference` is evenly divisible by 2 (i.e., it is an even number):
              - If yes, print `index` (this is also a valid result).
              - Exit the loop.

   e. **Increment the Counter:**
      - Increase the value of `index` by 1.

5. **End Program**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The loop continues indefinitely until a valid `index` is found, either when the sums match exactly or when the sum exceeds the target and the difference is even.
- This approach ensures that all potential candidates for `index` are checked systematically. 

This pseudocode presents a clear outline of the program's logic, making it understandable for individuals who may not be familiar with the specific programming language or syntax initially used.
