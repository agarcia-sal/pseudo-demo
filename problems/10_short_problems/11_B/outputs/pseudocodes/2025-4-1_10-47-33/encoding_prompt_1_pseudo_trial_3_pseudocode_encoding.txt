**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize the variable** `n` to the absolute value of the integer input.
2. **Set the variable** `i` to 0 (this will be used to calculate a sequence).
3. **Start an infinite loop** to perform the following actions:
   - **Calculate** `s` as the sum of the first `i` natural numbers, which is `i * (i + 1) / 2`.
   - **Calculate** `m` as `s - n`.
   - **Check if** `s` is equal to `n`:
     - If true, print the value of `i` and exit the loop.
   - **Check if** `s` is greater than `n`:
     - If true, check if `m` is an even number:
       - If `m` is even, print the value of `i` and exit the loop.
   - **Increment** the value of `i` by 1 to check the next number in the sequence.
