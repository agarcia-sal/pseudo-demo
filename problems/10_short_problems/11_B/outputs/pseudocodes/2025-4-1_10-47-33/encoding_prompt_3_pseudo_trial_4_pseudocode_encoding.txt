```plaintext
// Start of the program
// Input: a non-negative integer 'n'
Read the input number and assign its absolute value to 'n'

// Initialize a counter 'i' to zero
Set i to 0

// Begin an infinite loop to explore potential solutions
Repeat indefinitely:
    // Calculate the sum of the first 'i' numbers
    Assign sumOfFirsti to (i * (i + 1)) / 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between sumOfFirsti and n
    Assign difference to sumOfFirsti - n
    
    // Check if the sum equals the input number
    If sumOfFirsti is equal to n then:
        // Output the current value of 'i'
        Print the value of i
        // Exit the loop
        Exit the loop
    
    // Check if the sum exceeds the input number
    Else if sumOfFirsti is greater than n then:
        // Check if the difference is an even number
        If difference is even then:
            // Output the current value of 'i'
            Print the value of i
            // Exit the loop
            Exit the loop
    
    // Increment the counter to check the next number
    Increment i by 1
// End of program

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- The pseudocode outlines the steps of the original code, providing clarity on the logic and flow without diving into specific programming syntax.
- It starts by accepting input, initializes necessary variables, and employs a loop to find a valid result based on calculated conditions.
- The use of meaningful variable names like `sumOfFirsti` and `difference` helps in understanding what each part of the code is doing.
- Control structures are clearly defined to show the logic progression, making it easier to follow the program's intent.
