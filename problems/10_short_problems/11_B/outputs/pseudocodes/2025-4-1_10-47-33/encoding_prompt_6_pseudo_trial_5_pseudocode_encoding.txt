**Pseudocode for the Given Algorithm:**

```
BEGIN

    // Get the absolute value of user input as an integer
    SET number = absolute_value_of(int(user_input()))
    
    // Initialize a variable to keep track of index
    SET index = 0

    // Start an infinite loop to process the logic
    WHILE True DO
        
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
        SET sum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and the input number
        SET difference = sum - number
        
        // Check if the calculated sum matches the input number
        IF sum equals number THEN
            // If they match, print the current index and exit
            PRINT index
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the sum has exceeded the input number
        ELSE IF sum > number THEN
            
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference is even THEN
                // If the difference is even, print the current index and exit
                PRINT index
                BREAK
        
        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        SET index = index + 1

END
```

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

- The algorithm begins by accepting user input, converting it to an integer, and then ensuring it is non-negative.
- A variable named `index` is initialized at zero to count through natural numbers.
- An infinite loop is initiated to repeatedly calculate the sum of natural numbers until certain conditions are met.
- Inside the loop:
  - The sum of the first `index` natural numbers is calculated.
  - The difference between this sum and the input number is computed.
  - If the sum equals the input number, the current `index` is printed, and the loop terminates.
  - If the sum exceeds the input number, it checks if the difference is even. If it is, the current `index` is printed, and the loop ends.
- After each iteration, `index` is incremented to check the next natural number until one of the exit conditions is triggered.
