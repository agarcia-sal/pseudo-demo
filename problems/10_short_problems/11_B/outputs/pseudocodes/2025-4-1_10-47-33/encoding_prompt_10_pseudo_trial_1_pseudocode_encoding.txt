Here is the pseudocode derived from the provided code:

```
START

// Step 1: Get the absolute integer input
SET n TO absolute value of (input from user as an integer)

// Step 2: Initialize the counter variable
SET i TO 0

// Step 3: Begin an infinite loop to find the result
WHILE true DO
    // Calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers
    SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) / 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between sum and input
    SET m TO s - n
    
    // Step 4: Check if the sum equals n
    IF s EQUALS n THEN
        PRINT i
        BREAK
        
    // Step 5: Check if the sum exceeds n
    ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
        // Step 6: Check if the difference is even
        IF m MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
            PRINT i
            BREAK
        END IF
    END IF
    
    // Increment the counter for the next iteration
    INCREMENT i BY 1
END WHILE

END
```

### Explanation of the Components:
1. **Input**: User provides an integer which is processed to retrieve its absolute value.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `i` is initialized to zero to start counting.
3. **Loop**: The `while true` loop continually computes the sum of numbers until specific conditions are met.
4. **Calculations**: The sum `s` is computed using the formula for the sum of the first `i` natural numbers, and the difference `m` is calculated.
5. **Conditionals**: 
   - The first conditional checks if the computed sum equals the input number.
   - The second conditional checks if it exceeds the input, with a further check on the parity of `m`.
6. **Output**: The value of `i` is printed when the specific conditions are satisfied, and the loop is terminated.

### Assumptions:
- The input from the user is assumed to be a valid integer.
- The function `absolute value` is available to handle negative input.
- The `MODULO` operation is used to check for even/odd characteristics of the difference `m`.
