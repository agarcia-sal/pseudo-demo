Here's the pseudocode translation of the provided code, following the guided steps:

```plaintext
// Assume 'n' is a non-negative integer input by the user.

SET n to the absolute value of the integer input from the user
SET i to 0

// Begin an infinite loop
WHILE true DO
    // Calculate the sum of the first 'i' integers
    SET s to (i * (i + 1)) / 2
    // Calculate the difference between 's' and 'n'
    SET m to s - n
    
    // Check if the sum 's' is equal to 'n'
    IF s equals n THEN
        PRINT i  // Output the value of 'i'
        BREAK  // Exit the loop

    // Check if the sum 's' is greater than 'n'
    ELSE IF s greater than n THEN
        // Check if the difference 'm' is even
        IF m modulo 2 equals 0 THEN
            PRINT i  // Output the value of 'i'
            BREAK  // Exit the loop

    // Increment 'i' for the next iteration
    INCREMENT i by 1
END WHILE
```

### Explanation of Main Components:
1. **Variables:**
   - `n`: Stores the user's input (assumed non-negative integer).
   - `i`: A counter initialized to zero, used to compute the sum of the first 'i' integers.
   - `s`: Calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 'i'.
   - `m`: Computes the difference between `s` and `n`.

2. **Control Structures:**
   - **While Loop**: An infinite loop that continues until a `BREAK` is reached.
   - **If Conditions**: Used to check relationships between `s`, `n`, and `m` for decision-making.

### Breakdown of Actions:
- Calculate the triangular number `s` using the formula `s = i * (i + 1) / 2`.
- Compare `s` with `n` to determine if they are equal or if `s` is greater than `n`.
- If the conditions are met, either print `i` and exit or continue to the next iteration by incrementing `i`.

### Assumptions:
- The input for `n` is valid and non-negative, which is required for the logic to work correctly.
