Here's a clear and concise pseudocode translation of the given code following the guided steps:

```
BEGIN

    // Assume n is an integer input from the user
    SET n TO ABSOLUTE_VALUE( INTEGER( INPUT("Enter a number: ") ) )

    SET i TO 0                           // Initialize i to 0

    WHILE TRUE DO
        SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) / 2       // Calculate the sum of first i integers
        SET m TO s - n                   // Calculate the difference between sum and n

        IF s EQUALS n THEN               // Check if the sum equals n
            PRINT i                      // Output the value of i
            BREAK                       // Exit the loop
        
        ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN    // Check if the sum exceeds n
            IF m MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN      // Check if the difference is even
                PRINT i                   // Output the value of i
                BREAK                     // Exit the loop
            END IF
        END IF
        
        INCREMENT i BY 1                 // Increment i by 1
    END WHILE

END
```

### Breakdown of Components
1. **Operators and Structures**:
   - `SET` assigns values to variables.
   - `WHILE` loop runs indefinitely until a break condition is met.
   - `IF` statements are used for conditional logic.

2. **Complex Elements**:
   - The calculation for `s` and `m` is simplified into separate assignments.
   - The loop's conditional checks are clearly enumerated.

3. **Assumptions**:
   - `n` is assumed to be an absolute integer input by the user.
   - The pseudocode emphasizes that the input must be a number, and therefore treated as such.

4. **Clarity and Readability**:
   - Descriptive identifiers are used (e.g., `s` for the sum, `m` for the difference).
   - Clear actions specify intentions explicitly without jargon.

5. **Present Tense**:
   - The pseudocode uses present tense for all actions being executed within the program.
