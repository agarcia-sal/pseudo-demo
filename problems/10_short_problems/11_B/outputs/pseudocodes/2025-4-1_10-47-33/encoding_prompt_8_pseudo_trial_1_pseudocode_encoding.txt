**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer that, when added to itself (as represented by the sum of a sequence of consecutive integers up to that integer), equals a given positive number or can equal it when adjusted with a specific difference.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Get Input**: 
   - Prompt the user to enter a number.
   - Convert the input to a non-negative integer and store it in a variable called `targetNumber`.

2. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - Set a variable `currentInteger` to 0.

3. **Loop to Find the Result**: 
   - Start an endless loop that continues until a break condition is met.
     - Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to `currentInteger` and store it in a variable called `sumOfIntegers`.
     - Calculate the difference `difference` as `sumOfIntegers - targetNumber`.
     
     - **Check Conditions**:
       - If `sumOfIntegers` is equal to `targetNumber`: 
         - Print `currentInteger` (the solution).
         - Exit the loop.
       - Else if `sumOfIntegers` is greater than `targetNumber`:
         - Check if `difference` is even (can be evenly divided by 2):
           - If true, print `currentInteger` (the solution).
           - Exit the loop.
     
     - Increase `currentInteger` by 1 to consider the next integer in the next iteration.

**Comments**: 
- The loop runs until it finds an integer that either equals the target number or can achieve equality by adjusting the sum with an even difference.
- This approach ensures that all possibilities are evaluated incrementally.
