Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION findIntegerWithTriangleNumber(inputValue)
    // Step 1: Prepare the input value
    SET absoluteValue AS absolute of the integer inputValue
    
    // Step 2: Initialize a counter variable
    INITIALIZE counter AS 0
    
    // Step 3: Begin an infinite loop to calculate triangular numbers
    WHILE true DO
        // Calculate the current triangular number using the formula
        SET triangularNumber AS (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the triangular number and the absolute value
        SET difference AS triangularNumber - absoluteValue
        
        // Step 4: Check if the triangular number equals the absolute value
        IF triangularNumber EQUALS absoluteValue THEN
            PRINT counter // Found a match, output the counter
            BREAK // Exit the loop
            
        // Step 5: Check if the triangular number is greater than the absolute value
        ELSE IF triangularNumber GREATER THAN absoluteValue THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT counter // Found a match, output the counter
                BREAK // Exit the loop
            END IF
        END IF
        
        // Increment the counter for the next triangular number
        INCREMENT counter BY 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Purpose:** The function `findIntegerWithTriangleNumber` aims to identify the smallest non-negative integer `counter` such that its triangular number either equals or is greater than an input value, with specific conditions related to evenness of their difference.

2. **Input and Output Design:** The input is an integer (which is made absolute), and the output is the integer `counter` that meets the specified conditions.

3. **Control Structures:**
   - **Infinite Loop:** Continues until a solution is found (either via equality or through an even difference).
   - **Conditionals:** Directs the flow based on the comparison of the triangular number with the input value, employing nested checks.

By structuring the pseudocode in this manner, it abstracts complexity and presents an accessible overview of the algorithm's purpose and functionality.
