**Purpose:** This code calculates the smallest non-negative integer whose triangular number is equal to or exceeds a given input, and determines if the difference between this triangular number and the input allows for a valid arrangement.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
2. **Define Function to Find Triangular Number's Index**:
    - Accept a number called "targetNumber" as input.
3. **Convert Input to Non-negative Number**:
    - Set "targetNumber" to the absolute value of the integer given by the user.
4. **Initialize Counter**:
    - Set an integer variable "index" to 0 to track the current position for triangular numbers.
5. **Infinite Loop to Calculate Triangular Numbers**:
    - While true:
        1. **Calculate Triangular Number**:
            - Calculate "triangularNumber" as the sum of all integers from 0 to "index":
              - "triangularNumber" = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        2. **Calculate Difference**:
            - Set "difference" equal to "triangularNumber" - "targetNumber".
        3. **Check Conditions**:
            - If "triangularNumber" equals "targetNumber":
                - Print "index" (this is the result we seek).
                - Exit the loop.
            - Else if "triangularNumber" is greater than "targetNumber":
                - If "difference" is an even number:
                    - Print "index" (this is the result we seek).
                    - Exit the loop.
        4. **Increment Counter**:
            - Increase "index" by 1.
6. **End Program**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The triangular number formula used is based on the sum of the first "index" natural numbers.
- The program checks if the calculated triangular number either matches the input or can still accommodate the input with an even difference.
- If an acceptable index is found, the program prints it and stops running.

**Example Structure:**
```
FUNCTION FindTriangularNumberIndex(targetNumber):
    targetNumber = ABSOLUTE_VALUE(READ_USER_INPUT)
    index = 0
    
    WHILE TRUE:
        triangularNumber = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        difference = triangularNumber - targetNumber
        
        IF triangularNumber EQUALS targetNumber:
            PRINT index
            BREAK
        ELSE IF triangularNumber GREATER THAN targetNumber:
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0:
                PRINT index
                BREAK
        ENDIF
        
        index = index + 1
    ENDWHILE
END FUNCTION
```
This pseudocode enhances understanding by clearly outlining what each part of the code does while providing a logical flow of operations.
