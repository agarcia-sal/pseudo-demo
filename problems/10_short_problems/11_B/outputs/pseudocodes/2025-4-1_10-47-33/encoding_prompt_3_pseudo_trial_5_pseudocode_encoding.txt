### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The program begins by accepting an integer input and converting it to its absolute value.
- **Loop**: An infinite loop is initiated to keep checking sums of natural numbers until a condition is met.
- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first 'index' natural numbers is computed using the formula.
- **Conditions**: The loop checks two main conditions:
  1. If the current sum equals the user input.
  2. If the sum exceeds the user input, it checks whether the difference is even.
- **Output**: If any of the conditions are met, the current index is printed and the loop breaks.
- **Increment**: If conditions are not met, the index is incremented to evaluate the next number.
