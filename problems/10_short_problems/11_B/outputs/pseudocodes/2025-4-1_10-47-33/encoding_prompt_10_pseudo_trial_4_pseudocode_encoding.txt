**Pseudocode:**

```
1. Initialize variable n as the absolute value of the integer input
2. Set variable i to 0

3. While true:
    4. Calculate the sum s as the sum of the first i integers (s = i * (i + 1) / 2)
    5. Calculate the difference m as s - n

    6. If s is equal to n:
        7. Print the value of i
        8. Terminate the loop

    9. Else if s is greater than n:
        10. If m is even:
            11. Print the value of i
            12. Terminate the loop

    13. Increment i by 1
```

### Assumptions:
- The input is assumed to be a valid integer.
- The variable n represents a non-negative integer after taking its absolute value.
- The loop will eventually terminate under valid conditions where a solution is found.
