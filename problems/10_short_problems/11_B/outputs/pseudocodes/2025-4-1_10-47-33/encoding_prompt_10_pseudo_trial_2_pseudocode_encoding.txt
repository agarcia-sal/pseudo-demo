Hereâ€™s the pseudocode based on the guidelines provided:

```plaintext
// Assume n is a non-negative integer input by the user
SET n TO the absolute value of the integer input

// Initialize variable i to count the iterations
SET i TO 0

// Start an infinite loop to calculate triangular numbers
WHILE true DO
    // Calculate the i-th triangular number
    SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) divided by 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between the triangular number and n
    SET m TO s - n

    // Check if the triangular number is equal to n
    IF s EQUALS n THEN
        PRINT i  // Output the value of i
        BREAK  // Exit the loop

    // Check if the triangular number exceeds n
    ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
        // Check if the difference is even
        IF m MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
            PRINT i  // Output the value of i
            BREAK  // Exit the loop

    // Increment i for the next iteration
    INCREMENT i BY 1
END WHILE
```

### Key Components Identified:
- **Variables**: `n`, `i`, `s`, `m`
- **Loop**: An infinite loop to keep calculating triangular numbers
- **Conditionals**: Multiple checks to determine when to print and exit the loop
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Used for calculating triangular numbers and differences

### Breakdown of Complex Elements:
- The calculation of the triangular number `s` is separated from the checking conditions.
- The use of modulo to check evenness is also explicit.

### Assumptions:
- `n` is treated as a non-negative integer.
- The input is processed to ensure it is an integer and its absolute value is considered.

### Clarity and Readability:
- Each variable and action is explicitly labeled and stated in clear terms to convey the intended logic without using complex coding jargon.

### Verb Tenses:
- Present tense is utilized to outline the actions performed within the program.
