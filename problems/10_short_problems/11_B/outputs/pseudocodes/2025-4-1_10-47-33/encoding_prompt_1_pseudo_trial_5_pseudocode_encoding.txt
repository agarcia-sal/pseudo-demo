**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input:**
   - Read an integer value from the user.
   - Calculate the absolute value of the input and assign it to a variable called `targetNumber`.

2. **Initialize:**
   - Set a counter variable `index` to 0.

3. **Loop:**
   - Start an infinite loop:
     1. Calculate the sum of the first `index` natural numbers and assign it to a variable called `currentSum`. (This can be done using the formula: currentSum = index * (index + 1) / 2)
     2. Calculate the difference between `currentSum` and `targetNumber`, and assign it to a variable called `difference`.
     
     3. **Check Conditions:**
        - If `currentSum` is equal to `targetNumber`:
          - Print the value of `index`.
          - Exit the loop.
        - Else if `currentSum` is greater than `targetNumber`:
          - Check if `difference` is even:
            - If it is, print the value of `index` and exit the loop.
     
     4. Increment the value of `index` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the first integer `index` that meets either of the two conditions outlined above.
