BEGIN

        // Step 7: Check if the sum exceeds the user input

### Explanation of the Pseudocode Structure:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts with reading the user's input, which is processed to its absolute integer value.
2. **Loop Control Initialization**: A variable is initialized to control the loop iterations.
3. **Infinite Loop**: The main logic is contained within an endless loop until a break condition is met.
4. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first 'index' numbers is calculated.
5. **Comparison Logic**: The sum is compared to the input value in a sequential manner, with checks for exact equality and conditions for breaking the loop.
6. **Output**: If a condition is satisfied, the current 'index' is printed, and the loop terminates.
7. **Incrementing**: The loop progresses by incrementing the 'index' variable, allowing for an ongoing search for the solution.

This structure makes it easy for someone unfamiliar with the original code to understand the logic and flow of the algorithm.
