**Pseudocode: Determine the Smallest Integer Based on Given Criteria**

1. Start by receiving an integer input and store its absolute value in a variable named `absoluteValue`.
2. Initialize a variable `index` to 0, which will be used to track the current integer being evaluated.
3. Enter an infinite loop to repeatedly evaluate conditions based on `index`:
    - Calculate the sum of the first `index` integers and store this value in a variable called `sumOfIntegers`. This can be done using the formula where `sumOfIntegers` equals the result of `index` multiplied by (`index` + 1), divided by 2.
    - Calculate the difference between `sumOfIntegers` and `absoluteValue`, and store this difference in a variable named `difference`.
    
4. Check if `sumOfIntegers` is equal to `absoluteValue`:
    - If they are equal, print `index` as the resulting integer and exit the loop.
5. If `sumOfIntegers` is greater than `absoluteValue`:
    - Check if `difference` is an even number:
        - If it is even, print `index` as the resulting integer and exit the loop.
6. Increase `index` by 1 to evaluate the next integer and continue the loop.

**Output:** The output will be the smallest integer `index` that satisfies either the condition where the sum of the first `index` integers equals the absolute value of the input, or the condition where this sum exceeds the input, and the difference is an even number.
