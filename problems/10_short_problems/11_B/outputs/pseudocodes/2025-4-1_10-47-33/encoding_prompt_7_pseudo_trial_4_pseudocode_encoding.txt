Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION findSuitableInteger()
    // Read and convert the user input to an absolute integer
    SET userInput AS absolute value of integer from input()
    INITIALIZE index AS 0

    // Start an infinite loop to find the suitable integer
    WHILE true DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
        SET sum AS (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and the user input
        SET difference AS sum - userInput
        
        // Check if the calculated sum equals the user input
        IF sum EQUALS userInput THEN
            PRINT index  // Print the index if found
            BREAK  // Exit the loop
        // Check if the calculated sum is greater than the user input
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN userInput THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT index  // Print the index if found
                BREAK  // Exit the loop
        END IF
        
        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        index = index + 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode

1. **Input Handling:** The function begins by taking an integer input, converting it into an absolute value to ensure non-negative processing.

2. **Loop Mechanism:** An infinite loop is employed to continually calculate the sum of natural numbers until a valid integer is found or conditions are met.

3. **Sum Calculation:** It calculates the sum of integers from 0 to the current index using the formula for the triangular number: \( \text{sum} = \frac{\text{index} \times (\text{index} + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Condition Checks:** 
   - First, it checks if the `sum` equals the absolute user input.
   - If not, it checks if the `sum` exceeds the input. If it does, it checks whether the difference between the sum and input is even.

5. **Output:** Upon meeting either of the success conditions, the current index is printed, and the loop is exited.

The flow and logic of the original code are effectively maintained, ensuring clarity and comprehensibility for readers unfamiliar with programming specifics.
