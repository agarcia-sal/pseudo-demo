**Pseudocode for Finding the Maximum Integer with Specific Conditions**

```
BEGIN

    // Read the absolute value of user input and convert it to an integer
    userInput = get absolute value of integer input
    integerValue = userInput

    // Initialize an index for iteration
    index = 0

    // Begin an infinite loop to process until we find the solution
    WHILE true DO
        
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers
        sumOfIntegers = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the current sum and the input value
        difference = sumOfIntegers - integerValue

        // Check if the current sum is exactly equal to the input value
        IF sumOfIntegers equals integerValue THEN
            // If equal, print the current index and exit the loop
            PRINT index
            BREAK

        // Check if the current sum is greater than the input value
        ELSE IF sumOfIntegers greater than integerValue THEN
            
            // Check if the difference is an even number
            IF difference is divisible by 2 THEN
                // If the difference is even, print the current index and exit the loop
                PRINT index
                BREAK

        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        index = index + 1

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The algorithm begins by taking user input, converting it to an absolute integer value.

2. **Loop Structure**: An infinite loop is established to continuously calculate and check conditions until a break condition is met.

3. **Sum Calculation**: In each iteration, the sum of the first 'index' integers is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

4. **Difference Calculation**: The algorithm computes the difference between the calculated sum and the user input.

5. **Conditional Checks**:
   - The first condition checks if the calculated sum exactly matches the user input. If true, it prints the index and stops.
   - The second condition checks if the sum surpasses the user input and further checks if the difference is even. If it is, the index is printed and the loop terminates.

6. **Incrementing the Index**: After each cycle through the loop, the index is incremented to explore the next integer.

This structured approach allows one to follow the logic flow without specific programming knowledge, focusing on the operations and decisions made along the way.
