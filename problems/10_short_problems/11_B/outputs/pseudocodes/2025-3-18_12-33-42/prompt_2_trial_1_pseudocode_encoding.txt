**Pseudocode**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Get a number from the user and convert it to an absolute integer. Store this value as 'targetNumber'.

2. **Initialize Counter:**
   - Set a counter variable 'currentIndex' to zero.

3. **Iterative Search:**
   - Start an infinite loop:
     - Calculate 'sumOfFirstN' as the sum of all integers from 1 to 'currentIndex'. This can be calculated using the formula: (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) divided by 2.
     - Determine 'difference' by subtracting 'targetNumber' from 'sumOfFirstN'.

     - **Check Conditions:**
       - If 'sumOfFirstN' is equal to 'targetNumber':
         - Output 'currentIndex'.
         - Exit the loop.
       - Otherwise, if 'sumOfFirstN' is greater than 'targetNumber':
         - Check if 'difference' is an even number:
           - If it is even:
             - Output 'currentIndex'.
             - Exit the loop.

     - Increment 'currentIndex' by one.

**Output:**
- The output will be the value of 'currentIndex' that meets the specified conditions based on the user's input.
