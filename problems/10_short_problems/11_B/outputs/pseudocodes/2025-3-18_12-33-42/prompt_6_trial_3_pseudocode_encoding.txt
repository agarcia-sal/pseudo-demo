Here's a clear and understandable pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```plaintext
// Begin the algorithm

// Take absolute integer input from the user
userInput = Get absolute value of integer from user
set index = 0

// Start an infinite loop
while True do:
    // Calculate the sum of first 'index' integers
    sumOfFirstIndex = (index * (index + 1)) divided by 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between the sum and the user input
    difference = sumOfFirstIndex - userInput
    
    // Check if the sum is equal to the user input
    if sumOfFirstIndex equals userInput then:
        // Print the current index and exit the loop
        Print index
        Exit the loop
    
    // Check if the sum is greater than the user input
    else if sumOfFirstIndex is greater than userInput then:
        // Check if the difference is even
        if difference is even then:
            // Print the current index and exit the loop
            Print index
            Exit the loop
    
    // Increment index by 1 for the next iteration
    increment index by 1

// End of algorithm
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. The program starts by receiving an integer input from the user and ensures that it is positive by taking its absolute value.
2. It initializes a counter (`index`) to zero.
3. The algorithm enters an infinite loop to perform calculations based on the current value of `index`.
4. In each iteration, it calculates the sum of the first `index` integers.
5. It checks if this sum equals the user's input.
6. If the sum exceeds the user's input, it checks if the difference between the sum and the user input is even.
7. If either condition is satisfied, it outputs the current index and terminates the loop.
8. If neither condition is fulfilled, it increments the index and continues the loop.
