**Pseudocode:**

1. Define a variable `number` as the absolute value of an integer input from the user.
2. Initialize a variable `index` to zero, which will be used to track the current iteration.
3. Start an infinite loop that will continue until a break condition is met:
    - Calculate the sum `sumValue` of the first `index` natural numbers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
    - Determine the difference `difference` between `sumValue` and `number`.
    
    4. Check if `sumValue` is equal to `number`:
        - If they are equal, print `index` as the result and exit the loop.
        
    5. If `sumValue` is greater than `number`, check if `difference` is an even number:
        - If it is even, print `index` as the result and exit the loop.
        
    6. If neither condition is met, increment `index` by one and continue the loop. 

**Conclusions:**
- The process ultimately identifies and outputs a specific index based on summation conditions related to the given input number.
