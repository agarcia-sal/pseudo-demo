Here's the pseudocode that translates the provided code into clear and understandable logic:

```
BEGIN

    // Get the absolute value of an integer input
    SET inputNumber TO absoluteValue( convertInputToInteger() )
    
    // Initialize a variable to keep track of the index
    SET index TO 0

    // Infinite loop to find the desired index
    WHILE true DO

        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
        SET sum TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and the input number
        SET difference TO sum - inputNumber
        
        // Check if the sum equals the input number
        IF sum EQUALS inputNumber THEN
            // Print the current index and exit the loop
            PRINT index
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the sum is greater than the input number
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN inputNumber THEN
            
            // Check if the difference is an even number
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                // Print the current index and exit the loop
                PRINT index
                BREAK
            
        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        INCREMENT index BY 1
    
END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading an integer from the input and taking its absolute value.

2. **Initial Setup**: An index is set to zero, which will be used to calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers.

3. **Loop Logic**: The while loop continues indefinitely until a break condition is met. Inside the loop:
   - It calculates the sum of the first 'index' numbers.
   - It checks if this sum is equal to the input number, and if so, prints the index and exits.
   - If the sum exceeds the input number, it checks whether the difference between the sum and the input number is even; if it is, it prints the index and exits.
   - The index is then incremented for the next iteration.

This structure makes it clear and easy to follow the steps of the original algorithm without getting lost in specific programming language syntax.
