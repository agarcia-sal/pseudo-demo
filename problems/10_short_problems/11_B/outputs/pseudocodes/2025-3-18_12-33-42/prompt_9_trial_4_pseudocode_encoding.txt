**Purpose:** This code calculates and displays the first integer such that the sum of the first integer and all previous integers is either equal to a given number or exceeds it by an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Get a number from the user and store its absolute value in "targetNumber".

3. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set "currentInteger" to 0 (this will track the current integer being processed).

4. **Begin Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

   a. **Calculate Sum of Integers:**
      - Calculate "sumOfIntegers" as the sum of all integers from 0 to "currentInteger". This can be done using the formula: 
        - sumOfIntegers = (currentInteger * (currentInteger + 1)) divided by 2.

   b. **Determine Difference:**
      - Calculate "difference" as the result of subtracting "targetNumber" from "sumOfIntegers" (i.e., difference = sumOfIntegers - targetNumber).

   c. **Check for Equal Condition:**
      - If "sumOfIntegers" equals "targetNumber":
         - Print "currentInteger".
         - Exit the loop.
   
   d. **Check for Greater Condition:**
      - If "sumOfIntegers" is greater than "targetNumber":
         - If "difference" is an even number:
            - Print "currentInteger".
            - Exit the loop.

   e. **Increment the Current Integer:**
      - Increase "currentInteger" by 1.

5. **End Program**

This pseudocode clearly describes the algorithm's process and maintains a logical flow that reflects the original code's intent while avoiding specific programming syntax.
