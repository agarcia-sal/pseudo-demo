Here's the high-level pseudocode that accurately reflects the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION findIntegerBasedOnTriangularNumber()
    // Read an integer input and ensure it is positive
    SET positiveInteger TO absolute value of integer(input)

    // Initialize a counter variable
    SET index TO 0

    // Start an infinite loop to calculate triangular numbers
    WHILE True DO
        // Calculate the triangular number for the current index
        SET triangularNumber TO (index * (index + 1)) // 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the triangular number and the input
        SET difference TO triangularNumber - positiveInteger
        
        // Check if the triangular number is equal to the input
        IF triangularNumber == positiveInteger THEN
            PRINT index    // Output the index if it matches
            BREAK          // Exit the loop
        
        // Check if the triangular number is greater than the input
        ELSE IF triangularNumber > positiveInteger THEN
            // Check if the difference is an even number
            IF difference MOD 2 == 0 THEN
                PRINT index    // Output the index if the difference is even
                BREAK          // Exit the loop
        
        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        index = index + 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **Function Declaration**: The pseudocode begins by defining a function to encapsulate the logic for finding an integer based on triangular numbers.
  
2. **Input Handling**: It reads an integer input, ensuring it's non-negative by taking its absolute value.

3. **Loop Initialization**: A counter variable (`index`) is initialized to zero, which will be used to compute triangular numbers.

4. **Triangular Number Calculation**: An infinite loop is initiated to continuously calculate triangular numbers based on the current index.

5. **Condition Evaluations**:
   - It first checks if a computed triangular number matches the input value and prints the index.
   - If the triangular number exceeds the input, it then checks if the difference is even and prints the index if this condition is satisfied.

6. **Incrementing Counter**: The index is incremented after each evaluation to progress to the next triangular number.

7. **Termination**: The loop breaks once a valid index is found and printed.

This structured approach outlines the intent and functionality of the original code in an accessible way.
