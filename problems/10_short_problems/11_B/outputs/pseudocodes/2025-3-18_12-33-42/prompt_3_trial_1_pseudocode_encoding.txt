Here's a clear pseudocode representation of the provided code snippet, maintaining the core logic while enhancing readability and understanding:

```plaintext
1. START

2. PROMPT user for input
3. STORE absolute value of the input as 'inputValue'

4. INITIALIZE 'index' to 0

5. WHILE true DO
    a. CALCULATE 'triangleNumber' as the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
       (triangleNumber = index * (index + 1) / 2)
    
    b. CALCULATE 'difference' as triangleNumber - inputValue

    c. IF triangleNumber is equal to inputValue THEN
        i. PRINT 'index'
        ii. BREAK the loop

    d. ELSE IF triangleNumber is greater than inputValue THEN
        i. IF difference is even THEN
            - PRINT 'index'
            - BREAK the loop
    
    e. INCREMENT 'index' by 1
END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode

- **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by prompting the user for input and storing the absolute value of that input.
- **Looping Logic:** A while-loop runs indefinitely until a break condition is satisfied.
- **Triangle Number Calculation:** For each iteration, it calculates the triangular number for the current index.
- **Conditions:** The logic checks whether the triangular number equals the input value or if it surpasses it to make further evaluations.
- **Output:** The index is printed as soon as one of the conditions is satisfied, and the loop terminates.

This pseudocode is structured to allow someone unfamiliar with the original programming language to grasp the intended functionality easily.
