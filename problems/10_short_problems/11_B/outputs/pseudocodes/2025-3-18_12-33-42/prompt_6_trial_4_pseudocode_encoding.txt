**Pseudocode**

```
BEGIN

    // Read an integer input and take its absolute value
    SET targetNumber TO absolute value of input

    // Initialize the index variable used for calculations
    SET index TO 0

    // Infinite loop to explore values of index
    WHILE true DO
        
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers
        SET sum TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and the target number
        SET difference TO sum - targetNumber

        // Check if the calculated sum equals the target number
        IF sum is equal to targetNumber THEN
            // Print the index if the sum matches the target number
            PRINT index
            BREAK // Exit the loop

        // Check if the calculated sum exceeds the target number
        ELSE IF sum is greater than targetNumber THEN
            
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference is even THEN
                // Print the index if the difference is even
                PRINT index
                BREAK // Exit the loop

        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        INCREMENT index by 1

    END WHILE

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- The pseudocode begins by obtaining the absolute value of an integer input, which serves as the target number for further calculations.
- It initializes a variable `index` to zero, which will be used to calculate the sum of the first `index` integers.
- The `while true` loop will keep executing indefinitely until a breaking condition is met.
- Within the loop:
  - It calculates the sum of the first `index` integers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
  - It computes the difference between this sum and the `targetNumber`.
  - It checks if this sum equals the target number; if so, it prints the current index and exits the loop.
  - If the sum is greater than the target number, it checks if the difference is even; if it is, it also prints the index and exits.
- Finally, it increments the `index` variable to explore the next integer in the subsequent iteration. 

This high-level approach clearly summarizes the logic and flow of the original code while maintaining readability and comprehensibility.
