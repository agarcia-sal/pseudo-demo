**Purpose**: This code finds a non-negative integer that either equals a specific input number or, when subtracted from a sequence of triangular numbers, results in an even difference.

---

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start**: 
   - Read a number from user input and take its absolute value.
   - Store the absolute value in a variable called targetNumber.

2. **Initialize**:
   - Set a variable currentIndex to 0.

3. **Infinite Loop**:
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely until a condition is met:

   4. **Calculate Triangular Number**:
      - Compute the triangularNumber as the sum of all integers from 0 to currentIndex using the formula:
        - triangularNumber = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) divided by 2.

   5. **Calculate Difference**:
      - Determine the difference between triangularNumber and targetNumber.
      - Store this difference in a variable called difference.

   6. **Check Conditions**:
      - If triangularNumber equals targetNumber:
        - Print the currentIndex (this is the answer).
        - Exit the loop.
        
      - Else, if triangularNumber is greater than targetNumber:
        - If difference is even (difference modulo 2 equals 0):
          - Print the currentIndex (this is the answer).
          - Exit the loop.

   7. **Increment Index**:
      - Increase currentIndex by 1.

8. **End**.

**Comments**:
- The code continuously calculates the triangular numbers until it either matches the input number or finds that the difference between the triangular number and the input number is even.
- This approach ensures that the smallest integer satisfying the conditions is found quickly.
