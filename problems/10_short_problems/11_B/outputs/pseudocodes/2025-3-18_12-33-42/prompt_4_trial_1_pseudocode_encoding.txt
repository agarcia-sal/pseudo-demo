### Function Definitions:
1. **absolute_value_of_integer_input()**:
   - Prompt the user for input and convert it to absolute integer.
   
2. **sum_of_first_i_natural_numbers(i)**:
   - Return the sum of the first i natural numbers calculated as (i * (i + 1)) / 2.

3. **is even**:
   - Return true if a number is divisible by 2.
