Hereâ€™s a clear and concise pseudocode version of the given Python code, following the guided steps outlined:

```plaintext
START

DECLARE n AS INTEGER
SET n TO ABSOLUTE VALUE OF INTEGER INPUT("Enter a number: ")

DECLARE i AS INTEGER
SET i TO 0

WHILE TRUE DO
    DECLARE s AS INTEGER
    SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) / 2      // Calculate the sum of first i integers
    DECLARE m AS INTEGER
    SET m TO s - n                 // Calculate the difference between s and n

    IF s EQUALS n THEN
        PRINT i                     // Output i if s matches n
        BREAK                       // Exit loop

    ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
        IF m MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN // Check if m is even
            PRINT i                 // Output i if m is even
            BREAK                   // Exit loop
        END IF
    END IF

    INCREMENT i BY 1                // Increase i by 1 for the next iteration
END WHILE

END
```

### Explanation:

1. **Main Components:**
   - **Input/Output**: Taking user input for n and printing results.
   - **Variables**: n (user input), i (loop iterator), s (sum of first i integers), m (difference).
   - **Loops and Conditionals**: A while loop that continues indefinitely until it finds a solution, with nested if statements to handle different conditions.

2. **Break Down Complex Elements:**
   - The calculation of `s` and `m` is clearly separated into different steps to enhance readability.

3. **State Assumptions Clearly:**
   - It assumes the input is a valid integer that can be converted and that n can be negative (hence the use of absolute value).

4. **Maintain Clarity and Readability:**
   - Use meaningful identifiers (`n`, `i`, `m`, `s`) and structured statements that clearly describe each part of the process.

5. **Choose Appropriate Verb Tenses:**
   - Active present tense is used throughout the pseudocode to indicate ongoing actions and conditions.
