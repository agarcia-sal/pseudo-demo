**Pseudocode:**

1. Start
2. Prompt the user for input and store it as an integer
   - Set the variable 'n' to the absolute value of the input integer
3. Initialize a variable 'i' to 0
4. Begin an infinite loop:
   a. Calculate the sum 's' of the first 'i' natural numbers using the formula: s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
   b. Calculate the difference 'm' between 's' and 'n': m = s - n
   c. Check if 's' is equal to 'n':
      - If true, print the value of 'i' and exit the loop
   d. Check if 's' is greater than 'n':
      - If true, check if 'm' is even:
         - If true, print the value of 'i' and exit the loop
   e. Increment 'i' by 1
5. End
