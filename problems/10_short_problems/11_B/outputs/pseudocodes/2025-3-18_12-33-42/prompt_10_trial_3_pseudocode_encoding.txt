Here is a translation of the provided code into clear and concise pseudocode, following the guided steps you provided:

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set variable `n` to the absolute value of the integer input.
   - Set variable `i` to 0 (this will keep track of the iterative number).

2. **Start an Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following actions indefinitely:

     a. **Calculate Sum:**
        - Set variable `s` to the sum of numbers from 0 to `i`, using the formula: 
          \[ s = \frac{i \times (i + 1)}{2} \]
     
     b. **Calculate Difference:**
        - Set variable `m` to the difference `s - n`.

     c. **Check for Matches:**
        - If `s` is equal to `n`:
          - Print the value of `i`.
          - Exit the loop.

     d. **Check for Greater Sum:**
        - Else if `s` is greater than `n`:
          - If `m` is an even number:
            - Print the value of `i`.
            - Exit the loop.

     e. **Increment the Counter:**
        - Increase the value of `i` by 1.

**Assumptions:**
- The input is a valid integer.
- The input can be either positive or negative, but the code converts it into its absolute value.
- The process will eventually find a suitable `i` or run indefinitely for impossible values (e.g., negative numbers).

**Note:**
The pseudocode maintains clear structure and concise logic, representing the flow of operations without referencing specific programming language syntax. Each function is described in a way that emphasizes the action taken at each step.
