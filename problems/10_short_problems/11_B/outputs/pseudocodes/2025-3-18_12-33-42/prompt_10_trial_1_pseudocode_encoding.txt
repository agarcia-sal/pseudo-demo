Here's the pseudocode derived from the provided Python code, following the structured language concepts and your guidelines:

```plaintext
DECLARE variable n AS INTEGER
DECLARE variable i AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO 0
DECLARE variable s AS INTEGER
DECLARE variable m AS INTEGER

SET n TO absolute value of integer input

WHILE TRUE DO
    SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) / 2            // Calculate the sum of the first i integers
    SET m TO s - n                        // Determine the difference between s and n
    
    IF s EQUALS n THEN                   // Check if s equals n
        PRINT i                           // Output the current value of i
        BREAK                             // Exit the loop
    
    ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN        // Check if s exceeds n
        IF m MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN         // Check if m is even
            PRINT i                       // Output the current value of i
            BREAK                         // Exit the loop

    INCREMENT i BY 1                      // Move to the next integer
END WHILE
```

### Key Components Identified:
1. **Variable Declarations**: `n`, `i`, `s`, and `m` are declared for processing.
2. **Input Handling**: Input is taken and converted to an absolute integer value.
3. **Looping Structure**: The `WHILE TRUE` loop continues until a `BREAK` condition is met.
4. **Conditional Checks**: The code assesses if `s` equals or exceeds `n` and checks the evenness of `m`.
5. **Output**: Whenever a valid condition is met, `i` is printed.

### Assumptions:
- The variable `n` is assumed to be a non-negative integer after using the absolute value.
- The input is expected to be a valid integer that does not cause errors during conversion.

This pseudocode is clear and communicates the original logic without delving into programming syntax.
