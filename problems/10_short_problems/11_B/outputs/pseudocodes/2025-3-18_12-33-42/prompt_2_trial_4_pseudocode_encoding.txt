**Pseudocode Translation:**

1. **Start** the program.
2. **Receive** input from the user and convert it to a non-negative integer called `targetSum`.
3. **Initialize** a counter `index` to zero.
4. **Begin** an infinite loop:
   - Calculate the sum of the first `index` natural numbers and store it in a variable named `currentSum`.
   - Determine the difference between `currentSum` and `targetSum`, storing it as `difference`.
   - **Check** if `currentSum` is equal to `targetSum`:
     - If true, **output** the value of `index` and **exit** the loop.
   - **Check** if `currentSum` is greater than `targetSum`:
     - If true, **check** if `difference` is even:
       - If true, **output** the value of `index` and **exit** the loop.
   - **Increment** the `index` by one to examine the next natural number.
5. **End** the program. 

**Input Requirements:** The user must provide a single integer input, which can be negative or positive, and it will be treated as a non-negative number.

**Output Requirements:** The program will output an integer that represents the index where either the sum of natural numbers equals or surpasses the `targetSum` and satisfies the specified conditions.
