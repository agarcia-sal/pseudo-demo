**Purpose Summary**: The goal of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose sum of integers from 0 to that integer equals a specified absolute input value, or can be adjusted to equal that value by either increasing or decreasing some of the components of that sum.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **GetInput**: 
   - Read a number from the user.
   - Convert the number to its absolute value to handle both positive and negative inputs.

2. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - Set a counter `currentInteger` to 0 to keep track of the current integer being checked.

3. **Infinite Loop to Find Result**:
   - Repeat the following steps until the result is found:
     - Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to `currentInteger`. 
       - This sum is given by the formula: `sum = (currentInteger * (currentInteger + 1)) / 2`.
     - Calculate the difference between this sum and the absolute input: `difference = sum - inputValue`.
     
     - **Check Conditions**:
       - If `sum` equals the input value, print `currentInteger` and exit the loop.
       - If `sum` is greater than the input value, proceed to the next check:
         - If `difference` is an even number, print `currentInteger` and exit the loop.
       
     - Increment `currentInteger` by 1 to check the next integer.

**Comments for Clarity**:
- This approach systematically checks each integer, starting from 0, to find the first integer that meets the given conditions regarding the sum and the provided input value.
- The process will continue until a suitable integer is found based on the relationships defined by the total sum and its comparison to the input.

**Example Structure**:
The pseudocode utilizes descriptive variable names and clear step descriptions for operations, ensuring that it can be easily understood by those who might not be familiar with programming syntax. 

This pseudocode maintains the essential logic and flow of the original code while clarifying its intent and operations for an audience unfamiliar with detailed coding practices.
