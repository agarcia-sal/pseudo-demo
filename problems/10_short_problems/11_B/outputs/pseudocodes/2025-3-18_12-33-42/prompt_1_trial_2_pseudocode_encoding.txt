**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**: Begin the algorithm.

2. **Input**: Read an integer value from the user and store its absolute value in a variable named `targetValue`.

3. **Initialize**: Set a counter variable `currentIndex` to 0 to keep track of iterations.

4. **Loop**: Continue executing the following steps indefinitely:

   a. **Calculate Sum**: Compute the sum `currentSum` of the first `currentIndex` natural numbers using the formula:  
      `currentSum = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2`

   b. **Calculate Difference**: Determine the difference `differenceFromTarget` by subtracting `targetValue` from `currentSum`:  
      `differenceFromTarget = currentSum - targetValue`
      
   c. **Check Conditions**:
      - If `currentSum` is equal to `targetValue`, then:
        - **Output**: Print `currentIndex` as it is the solution.
        - **Exit**: Terminate the loop.
        
      - Else if `currentSum` is greater than `targetValue`, then:
        - If the `differenceFromTarget` is even, then:
          - **Output**: Print `currentIndex` as it is the solution.
          - **Exit**: Terminate the loop.
          
   d. **Increment**: Increase `currentIndex` by 1 to evaluate the next natural number in the next iteration.

5. **End**: Conclude the algorithm once a result has been printed and the loop is exited.
