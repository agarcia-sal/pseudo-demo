**Purpose:**  
The objective of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies a specific condition related to the sum of the first `i` natural numbers compared to a given number `n`.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input**: 
   - Prompt the user for an input value and store it in a variable called `inputNumber`.
   - Convert `inputNumber` to an integer and take its absolute value. Assign this value to a variable named `targetValue`.

2. **Initialize Starting Point**: 
   - Create a variable `index` and set it to 0. This variable will increment in each iteration.

3. **Begin Infinite Loop**: 
   - Continue indefinitely until a condition is met that allows for breaking out of the loop:
   
   4. **Calculate Sum**: 
      - Compute the sum of the first `index` natural numbers and store it in a variable called `sumOfNumbers`.
      - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `sumOfNumbers = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`.

   5. **Calculate Difference**: 
      - Compute the difference `difference` between `sumOfNumbers` and `targetValue`. Assign this to a variable named `difference`.

   6. **Check Conditions**: 
      - **If Condition**: 
         - If `sumOfNumbers` is equal to `targetValue`, then:
            - Print the value of `index`, which is the answer we are looking for.
            - Exit the loop.
      
      - **Else If Condition**: 
         - If `sumOfNumbers` is greater than `targetValue`, then:
            - Check if `difference` is even by evaluating `difference % 2 == 0`.
              - If `difference` is even, then:
                 - Print the value of `index`.
                 - Exit the loop.

   7. **Increment Index**: 
      - Increase the value of `index` by 1.

**Example Structure:**
``` 
Get user input and set targetValue to absolute value of input
Set index to 0
Repeat forever:
    Calculate sumOfNumbers as sum of first index natural numbers
    Calculate difference as sumOfNumbers minus targetValue
    If sumOfNumbers equals targetValue:
        Print index
        Exit loop
    Else if sumOfNumbers greater than targetValue:
        If difference is even:
            Print index
            Exit loop
    Increase index by 1
``` 

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The loop continues until it finds an appropriate index that matches the target condition.
- The use of evenness in the difference helps determine if a solution has been found when the sum exceeds the target value.
