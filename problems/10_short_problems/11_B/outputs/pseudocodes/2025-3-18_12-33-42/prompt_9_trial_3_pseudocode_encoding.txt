**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to find a non-negative integer that either corresponds to a specific triangular number or can be represented by adjusting the triangular number with an even difference.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Get an integer value from the user and convert it to its absolute value.
   - Store this value in a variable called targetNumber.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter variable called integerIndex to 0.

3. **Start Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely until a break condition is met:

     a. **Calculate Triangular Number:**
        - Compute the triangular number using the formula: 
          - triangularNumber = (integerIndex * (integerIndex + 1)) / 2

     b. **Calculate Difference:**
        - Find the difference between the triangular number and the target number:
          - difference = triangularNumber - targetNumber
     
     c. **Check Conditions:**
        - If triangularNumber is equal to targetNumber:
          - Output integerIndex and exit the loop.
        
        - Else if triangularNumber is greater than targetNumber:
          - If the difference is even:
            - Output integerIndex and exit the loop.

     d. **Increment Index:**
        - Increase integerIndex by 1 for the next iteration.

**Output Explanation:**
- The program will output the integerIndex if it matches the triangular number exactly or if the adjustment needed results in an even difference. The loop continues until a valid index is found.
