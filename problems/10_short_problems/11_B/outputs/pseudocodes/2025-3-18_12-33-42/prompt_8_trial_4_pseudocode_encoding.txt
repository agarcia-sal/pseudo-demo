**Purpose Statement**: The primary goal of the code is to find and print a specific integer that meets certain conditions related to an input number, using a mathematical approach involving triangular numbers.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Get User Input**:
   - Read an integer from the user.
   - Take the absolute value of the integer and store it in a variable called `absoluteValue`.

2. **Initialize Counter**:
   - Set a variable `counter` to 0.

3. **Loop to Find Solution**:
   - Begin an infinite loop:
     - Calculate the triangular number `triangularNumber` using the formula:
       - `triangularNumber = (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2`
     - Calculate the difference `difference` between `triangularNumber` and `absoluteValue`:
       - `difference = triangularNumber - absoluteValue`
     
     - **Check Conditions**:
       - If `triangularNumber` is equal to `absoluteValue`:
         - Print `counter` (this is the solution).
         - Exit the loop.
       - Else if `triangularNumber` is greater than `absoluteValue`:
         - If `difference` is even:
           - Print `counter` (this is the solution).
           - Exit the loop.
     
     - Increment `counter` by 1.

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The loop continues indefinitely until a solution is found based on the conditions checked.
- Triangular numbers are calculated incrementally, and the algorithm checks for two possible scenarios where a valid solution might exist.
- The use of absolute value ensures that the program handles negative input correctly. 

This pseudocode provides a clear and logical representation of the code's functionality, making it understandable to readers unfamiliar with programming syntax.
