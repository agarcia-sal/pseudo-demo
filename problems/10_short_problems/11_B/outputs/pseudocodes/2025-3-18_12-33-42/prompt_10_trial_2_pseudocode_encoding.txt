Here is the pseudocode translation of the provided code, following the structured language concepts as guided:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Declare an integer variable n to hold the absolute value of user input
    DECLARE n AS INTEGER
    n = ABS(INT(INPUT("Enter a number: ")))

    // Initialize an integer variable i to use as a counter
    DECLARE i AS INTEGER
    i = 0

    // Begin an indefinite loop
    WHILE TRUE DO

        // Calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers
        DECLARE s AS INTEGER
        s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between s and n
        DECLARE m AS INTEGER
        m = s - n
        
        // Check if s equals n
        IF s EQUALS n THEN
            PRINT i
            BREAK // Exit the loop
            
        // Check if s is greater than n
        ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
            // Check if the difference m is even
            IF m MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT i
                BREAK // Exit the loop
            END IF
        END IF
        
        // Increment i to check the next natural number
        i = i + 1

    END WHILE

END
```

### Assumptions:
1. The input provided by the user is a valid integer.
2. The function `ABS()` returns the absolute value of its argument.
3. The function `INT()` converts user input to an integer.
4. The `PRINT` statement outputs the value to the user.
5. The `BREAK` statement exits the loop immediately when executed. 

### Explanation of Main Components:
- **Variables**: `n`, `i`, `s`, `m` are used to store integer values and results of calculations.
- **Loop**: The `WHILE TRUE DO` creates an infinite loop that continues until a `BREAK` statement is encountered.
- **Conditionals**: `IF...THEN...ELSE` structures allow for decision-making within the loop based on the values of `s`, `n`, and `m`.
- **Mathematical Operations**: The pseudocode includes arithmetic calculations and conditions to determine when to exit the loop.
