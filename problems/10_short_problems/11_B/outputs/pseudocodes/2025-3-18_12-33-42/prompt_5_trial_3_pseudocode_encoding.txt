### Purpose:
The objective of this code is to find a non-negative integer \( i \) such that the sum of the first \( i \) natural numbers either equals or surpasses a given absolute input number \( n \). If the sum surpasses \( n \), it checks if the difference between the sum and \( n \) is even.

### Pseudocode:

1. **Start Program**

2. **Accept User Input:**
   - Get a number from the user.
   - Convert the input to an integer.
   - Take the absolute value of this integer and store it in a variable named `targetValue`.

3. **Initialize Counter:**
   - Set a counter variable `currentIndex` to 0.

4. **Begin Infinite Loop:**
   - While true:
     1. **Calculate the Sum:**
        - Compute the sum of the first `currentIndex` natural numbers using the formula: 
          \[
          sum = \frac{currentIndex \times (currentIndex + 1)}{2}
          \]
     2. **Calculate the Difference:**
        - Determine the difference between the sum and `targetValue`:
          \[
          remainder = sum - targetValue
          \]

     3. **Check Conditions:**
        - If the `sum` is equal to `targetValue`:
          - Print `currentIndex` (found the desired index).
          - Exit loop.
        - Else if the `sum` is greater than `targetValue`:
          - Check if `remainder` is even:
            - If yes, print `currentIndex` (found the desired index).
            - Exit loop.

     4. **Increment the Counter:**
        - Increase `currentIndex` by 1.

5. **End Program**

### Example Comments for Clarity:
- The infinite loop continues to check sums for increasing values of `currentIndex`.
- The conditional checks help determine if we need to display `currentIndex` based on our required conditions being met.

### Key Notes:
- Ensure input is properly handled to capture only non-negative integers.
- The sum of the first \( i \) natural numbers increases as \( i \) increases, which allows us to effectively find the solution required.
- The program relies on the properties of even and odd numbers to determine if the condition is satisfied when the sum surpasses the input.

This structured approach simplifies the original code into an easily understandable format while retaining its core logic and functionality.
