**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to find the smallest non-negative integer such that the sum of the first 'i' natural numbers either equals a given input value or exceeds it by an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the process:**
   - Read an integer input from the user and take its absolute value. Assign this value to a variable named `targetSum`.

2. **Initialize a variable:**
   - Set a variable `currentIndex` to 0 to represent the current integer we are testing.

3. **Begin an infinite loop:**
   - While true, repeat the following steps:

     1. **Calculate the sum of the first 'currentIndex' natural numbers:**
        - Let `currentSum` be equal to the total of integers from 1 up to `currentIndex`, which can be calculated using the formula: `currentSum = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2`.

     2. **Calculate the difference between the `currentSum` and `targetSum`:**
        - Let `difference` be equal to `currentSum - targetSum`.

     3. **Check for equality:**
        - If `currentSum` is equal to `targetSum`:
          - Output `currentIndex` (this is the solution).
          - Exit the loop.

     4. **Check if the sum exceeds the target:**
        - If `currentSum` is greater than `targetSum`:
          - If `difference` is an even number:
            - Output `currentIndex` (this is also a valid solution).
            - Exit the loop.

     5. **Increment the index for the next iteration:**
        - Increase `currentIndex` by 1.

**End of Algorithm.**
