Hereâ€™s the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION findMinimalInteger()
    // Prompt the user for an integer input and take its absolute value
    SET userInput TO absolute value of (integer input from the user)
    
    // Initialize a counter to keep track of the current integer
    SET currentInteger TO 0

    // Enter an infinite loop to find the required integer
    WHILE TRUE DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first currentInteger numbers
        SET sum TO (currentInteger * (currentInteger + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and userInput
        SET difference TO sum - userInput
        
        // Check if the calculated sum equals userInput
        IF sum EQUALS userInput THEN
            // Print the current integer and exit the loop
            PRINT currentInteger
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the calculated sum exceeds userInput
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN userInput THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                // Print the current integer and exit the loop
                PRINT currentInteger
                BREAK
        
        // Increment the counter for the next iteration
        currentInteger INCREMENT BY 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Purpose:** The function `findMinimalInteger()` is designed to find the minimal integer `i` such that either the sum of the first `i` integers equals or is greater than the absolute value of the user input. If the sum is greater, it checks if the difference is even before printing `i`.
- **Input:** An integer value from the user, which is converted to its absolute form.
- **Output:** The minimal integer `i` is printed that satisfies the conditions.
- **Control Structures:** The infinite loop continuously calculates and checks conditions until it finds a valid integer or meets the exit criteria.

This pseudocode simplifies the original code while maintaining clarity, making it accessible to readers with different programming backgrounds.
