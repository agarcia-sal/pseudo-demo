Here is the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION find_special_integer()
    PROMPT user for an integer input
    SET absolute_value to the absolute value of the input
    INITIALIZE index to 0

    WHILE true DO
        SET sum_of_first_index to (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        SET difference to sum_of_first_index - absolute_value
        
        IF sum_of_first_index is equal to absolute_value THEN
            PRINT index  // Found a match
            BREAK  // Exit the loop
        ELSE IF sum_of_first_index is greater than absolute_value THEN
            IF difference is even THEN
                PRINT index  // Condition satisfied
                BREAK  // Exit the loop
            END IF
        END IF

        INCREMENT index by 1  // Move to the next number
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:

1. **Purpose:** The function aims to find the smallest non-negative integer index such that the sum of the first `index` natural numbers either equals or exceeds a given absolute input value, with conditions governing when to print the index.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - **Input:** An integer provided by the user (the function considers its absolute value).
   - **Output:** Prints the smallest index that meets the specified conditions.

3. **Variables:**
   - `absolute_value`: Stores the absolute value of the input integer.
   - `index`: A counter starting from zero used to compute the sum of the first `index` natural numbers.
   - `sum_of_first_index`: The sum of the first `index` integers.
   - `difference`: The difference between `sum_of_first_index` and `absolute_value`.

4. **Control Flow:**
   - The primary loop continues indefinitely until a `break` condition is met.
   - Conditions check for equality and whether the difference is even when the sum exceeds the absolute value.

5. **Clarity:** The pseudocode uses straightforward language to describe operations and maintains high-level abstraction, omitting low-level implementation details.
