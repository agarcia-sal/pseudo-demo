**Explanation:**
- This pseudocode outlines the process of seeking a specific index such that the sum of the first `index` integers meets certain criteria relative to an absolute input number.
- It includes logical branches to evaluate when to print the index based on whether the specific sum matches or exceeds the target number, while also checking parity of the difference.
- The structure is clear, allowing readers to understand the flow and logic without requiring knowledge of programming syntax.
