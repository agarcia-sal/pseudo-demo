**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program**
  
2. **Receive user input:**
   - Prompt the user for a number
   - Convert the input to an integer and take the absolute value
   - Store this value as `targetNumber`

3. **Initialize a counter variable:**
   - Set `index` to 0

4. **Begin an infinite loop:**
   - Calculate `sumOfFirstN` as the sum of the first `index` integers using the formula: 
     `sumOfFirstN = index * (index + 1) / 2`
   
   - Calculate `difference` as `sumOfFirstN - targetNumber`

   - **Check conditions:**
     - If `sumOfFirstN` is equal to `targetNumber`:
       - Print `index`
       - Exit the loop
       
     - Else if `sumOfFirstN` is greater than `targetNumber`:
       - If `difference` is even:
         - Print `index`
         - Exit the loop

   - **Increment the counter:**
     - Increase `index` by 1

5. **End of program** 

**Note:** The algorithm finds the smallest non-negative integer `index` such that either the sum of the first `index` integers is equal to or can be adjusted by an even difference to match the `targetNumber`.
