**Purpose:** The primary goal of the code is to find the largest integer whose triangular number is equal to or exceeds a given absolute integer input. It also checks if the difference between the triangular number and the input is even.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get User Input:**
   - Accept an integer input from the user.
   - Store the absolute value of this integer in a variable called `targetValue`.

2. **Initialize Counter:**
   - Create a variable `counter` and set it to 0. This variable will help to calculate triangular numbers.

3. **Loop to Find Triangular Number:**
   - Start an infinite loop (this will run until a break condition is met).
     - Calculate the triangular number `triangularNumber` using the formula:
       - `triangularNumber = (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2`
     - Calculate the difference `difference` between the triangular number and the target value:
       - `difference = triangularNumber - targetValue`

     - **Check Conditions:**
       - If `triangularNumber` is equal to `targetValue`:
         - Print the current value of `counter`. This is the result we are looking for.
         - Exit the loop.
       - If `triangularNumber` is greater than `targetValue`:
         - Check if `difference` is even:
           - If `difference` is even:
             - Print the current value of `counter`. This is another valid result.
             - Exit the loop.

     - Increment the `counter` by 1 to move to the next integer and continue the loop.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The `triangularNumber` is the sum of the first `counter` integers.
- The difference is calculated to check if itâ€™s even, indicating a specific condition met during the comparison.

**Example Structure:**
```plaintext
GET targetValue FROM USER INPUT
SET targetValue TO absolute value of input

SET counter TO 0

WHILE true:
    SET triangularNumber TO (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2
    SET difference TO triangularNumber - targetValue

    IF triangularNumber IS equal to targetValue THEN:
        PRINT counter
        BREAK

    ELSE IF triangularNumber IS greater than targetValue THEN:
        IF difference IS even THEN:
            PRINT counter
            BREAK

    INCREMENT counter BY 1
```

This structured approach provides a clear and logical flow of the program, focusing on its purpose, processes, and outcomes without the need for specific programming language syntax.
