**Summary of Purpose:**
The goal of this code is to find a non-negative integer that satisfies a specific condition based on the sum of the first 'i' integers and a user-provided value.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Step 1: Get the absolute value of user input
    INPUT userInput
    n = ABSOLUTE_VALUE( CONVERT userInput TO INTEGER )

    // Step 2: Initialize a counter for the sum calculation
    i = 0

    // Step 3: Repeat indefinitely until a condition is met
    REPEAT
        // Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first 'i' integers
        s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2

        // Step 5: Calculate the difference between the sum and user input
        m = s - n

        // Step 6: Check if the sum equals the user input
        IF s EQUALS n THEN
            // Step 6a: Print the current integer 'i' if the condition is met
            PRINT i
            BREAK the loop

        // Step 7: Check if the sum is greater than the user input
        ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
            // Step 7a: Check if the difference is even
            IF m MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                // Step 7b: Print the current integer 'i' if the condition is met
                PRINT i
                BREAK the loop

        // Step 8: Increment 'i' for the next iteration
        i = i + 1

END PROGRAM
```

### Additional Notes:
- The program continuously calculates the sum of the first 'i' integers until either the sum equals 'n' or exceeds 'n' and the difference between the sum and 'n' is even.
- The use of "ABSOLUTE_VALUE" ensures that the input is non-negative, and "CONVERT userInput TO INTEGER" handles input properly.
- The conditions are structured to ensure only valid scenarios are printed.
- This pseudocode is designed to be comprehensible for readers who may not be familiar with programming syntax, breaking down each step clearly to illustrate the flow and logic of the original code.
