Here's the pseudocode that accurately represents the provided code, following the specified guidelines:

```
FUNCTION findIntegerForTriangularNumber()
    PROMPT user for input and store as absolute integer 'number'
    INITIALIZE 'index' to 0
    
    WHILE TRUE DO
        CALCULATE 'triangularSum' as (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        SET 'difference' as triangularSum - number
        
        IF triangularSum EQUALS number THEN
            PRINT index
            BREAK
        
        ELSE IF triangularSum GREATER THAN number THEN
            IF difference MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT index
                BREAK
        
        INCREMENT index by 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition:** It defines a function named `findIntegerForTriangularNumber()`.
2. **Input Handling:**
   - Prompts the user for input and converts it to an absolute integer named `number`.
3. **Initialization:** Sets the `index` variable to 0, which will be used to calculate triangular numbers.
4. **Loop Structure:**
   - A while loop is initiated that runs indefinitely until a break condition is met.
5. **Triangular Number Calculation:** 
   - For each iteration, it calculates the triangular number (`triangularSum`) using the formula (index * (index + 1)) / 2.
6. **Comparison Logic:**
   - It checks whether the `triangularSum` equals `number`. If so, it prints the current `index` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the `triangularSum` is greater than `number`, it checks if the difference between the two (`difference`) is even. If it is, it also prints the current `index` and breaks out of the loop.
7. **Increment:** The `index` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

This pseudocode summarizes the logic of the original code clearly while using descriptive variable names and a structured format to enhance understanding.
