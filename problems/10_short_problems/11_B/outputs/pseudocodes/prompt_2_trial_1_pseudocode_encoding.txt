**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Receive Input**
   - Get a number from the user and store its absolute value in `targetNumber`.

3. **Initialize Counter**
   - Set a counter `index` to 0.

4. **Infinite Loop**
   - Repeat the following actions indefinitely:
     1. **Calculate Sum**
        - Compute the sum of the first `index` natural numbers and store it in `currentSum`. This can be done by using the formula: `currentSum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`.
     
     2. **Calculate Difference**
        - Determine the difference `difference` between `currentSum` and `targetNumber` by calculating `difference = currentSum - targetNumber`.

     3. **Check for Exact Match**
        - If `currentSum` is equal to `targetNumber`:
          - Output the value of `index`.
          - Exit the loop.
     
     4. **Check for Exceeding Target**
        - If `currentSum` is greater than `targetNumber`:
          - Check if the `difference` is an even number.
          - If `difference` is even:
            - Output the value of `index`.
            - Exit the loop.
        
     5. **Increment Counter**
        - Increase `index` by 1.

5. **End**
