Here is the pseudocode translation of the given code, following the guided steps:

```plaintext
// Define the main components
START

// Get the absolute integer input from the user
SET n TO absolute value of integer(input)
SET i TO 0

// Infinite loop
WHILE true DO
    // Calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers
    SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) / 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between the sum and n
    SET m TO s - n
    
    // Check if the sum equals n
    IF s EQUALS n THEN
        PRINT i
        BREAK 

    // Check if the sum is greater than n
    ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
        // Check if the difference is even
        IF m MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
            PRINT i
            BREAK 
    END IF
    
    // Increment i for the next iteration
    INCREMENT i BY 1

END WHILE

END
```

### Assumptions:
1. The input provided by the user can be converted to an integer.
2. The values of `s` and `m` are assumed to maintain integer properties throughout the calculations (i.e., no decimals).
3. The input is non-negative since only the absolute value is taken.
4. The loop will eventually terminate due to the properties of natural numbers and their sums in relation to `n`.
