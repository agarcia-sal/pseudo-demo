**Purpose:** The goal of the code is to find and print the smallest non-negative integer which, when the sum of all integers from 0 up to that integer is calculated, either equals a given number or allows us to reach that number by adjusting the sum with an even number.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program.**

2. **Get Input:** 
   - Prompt the user for a number.
   - Convert the input to an absolute integer value and store it as `targetNumber`.

3. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set a counter `integer` to 0.

4. **Start an Infinite Loop:**
   - While true, execute the following steps:

   5. **Calculate the Sum:**
      - Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to `integer`:
        - `sumOfIntegers = (integer * (integer + 1)) / 2`
        
   6. **Determine the Difference:**
      - Calculate the difference `difference` as:
        - `difference = sumOfIntegers - targetNumber`

   7. **Check for Equality:**
      - If `sumOfIntegers` equals `targetNumber`:
        - Print `integer` (this is the answer).
        - Exit the loop.

   8. **Check for Exceeding Target:**
      - If `sumOfIntegers` is greater than `targetNumber`:
        - If `difference` is an even number:
          - Print `integer` (this is the answer).
          - Exit the loop.

   9. **Increment the Counter:**
      - Increase `integer` by 1.

10. **End the Program.**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The loop continues until we either find an exact match or a situation that allows us to adjust the sum down to the target number using an even number.
- The mathematical formula used for the sum is derived from the concept of the triangular number, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
