**Purpose:** This code determines the minimum number of consecutive integers starting from 0 such that their sum is either equal to a given number or can be matched by removing an even number from the total sum, then outputs this count.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number.
   - Store the absolute value of the number as `targetSum`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0. This will keep track of the current consecutive integer.

3. **Continuous Loop:**
   - Repeat indefinitely until a condition is met:
     - Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to `index`, and store it in `totalSum`.
     - Calculate the difference, `difference`, between `totalSum` and `targetSum`.

4. **Check Conditions:**
   - **If `totalSum` is equal to `targetSum`:**
     - Output the value of `index`.
     - End the loop (stop the program).
   - **Else If `totalSum` is greater than `targetSum`:**
     - Check if `difference` is even:
       - If it is even, output the value of `index`.
       - End the loop (stop the program).
   - Increment `index` by 1 to check the next consecutive integer.

**Example Steps of Execution:**
- Start with `index = 0`.
- Calculate `totalSum`.
- Check if `totalSum` matches `targetSum`, and proceed accordingly.

**Comment for Clarity:**
- The code finds the smallest `index` such that the sum of integers from 0 to `index` either equals `targetSum` or allows for an even adjustment to reach `targetSum`. 

By breaking down the code into simple steps, anyone familiar with basic programming concepts can follow the logic and purpose of the implementation easily.
