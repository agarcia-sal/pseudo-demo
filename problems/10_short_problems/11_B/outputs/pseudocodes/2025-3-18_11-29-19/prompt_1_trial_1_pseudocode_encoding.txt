**Pseudocode: Find Index of Triangular Number or Its Adjusted Value**

1. Start the program.
2. Read an integer value from user input and store the absolute value in a variable called `targetValue`.
3. Initialize a variable `index` to 0 to keep track of the index of triangular numbers.
4. Enter an infinite loop:
   - Calculate the triangular number `triangularNumber` using the formula: 
     - `triangularNumber = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`
   - Calculate the difference `difference` between `triangularNumber` and `targetValue`:
     - `difference = triangularNumber - targetValue`
   - If `triangularNumber` is equal to `targetValue`:
     - Print the current `index`.
     - Exit the loop.
   - Else if `triangularNumber` is greater than `targetValue`:
     - If `difference` is even:
       - Print the current `index`.
       - Exit the loop.
   - Increment `index` by 1 to check the next triangular number.
5. End the program. 

**Note:** The loop continues until either a triangular number matches the target or the adjusted condition (even difference) is satisfied.
