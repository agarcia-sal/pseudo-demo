**Pseudocode:**

```
# Start of the program
# Read an integer input and calculate its absolute value
SET number to absolute value of input

# Initialize a counter variable
SET index to 0

# Loop indefinitely until a break condition is met
WHILE TRUE DO
    # Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
    SET sum to (index * (index + 1)) / 2
    
    # Determine the difference between the calculated sum and the input number
    SET difference to sum - number

    # Check if the sum equals the input number
    IF sum is equal to number THEN
        # If so, print the index and exit the loop
        PRINT index
        BREAK

    # Check if the sum is greater than the input number
    ELIF sum is greater than number THEN
        # Check if the difference is an even number
        IF difference is even THEN
            # If so, print the index and exit the loop
            PRINT index
            BREAK

    # Increment the index for the next iteration
    INCREMENT index by 1
END WHILE
# End of the program
```

### Explanation:
1. The program first reads an integer input and converts it to its absolute value.
2. It initializes a counter `index` to zero.
3. Within a continuous loop, it calculates the sum of the first `index` natural numbers.
4. It checks if this sum equals the provided number:
   - If they are equal, it prints the current index and stops the loop.
5. If the sum exceeds the number, it checks if the difference between the sum and the number is even:
   - If so, it prints the current index and stops the loop.
6. If neither condition is satisfied, it increments `index` and repeats the process.
