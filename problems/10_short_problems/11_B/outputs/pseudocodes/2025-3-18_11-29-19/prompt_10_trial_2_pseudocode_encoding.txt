**Pseudocode: Find Index of a Specific Sum**

**Assumptions:**
- The input variable `n` is a non-negative integer.
- The variable `i` is initialized as a counter starting from zero.
- The formula used (s = i * (i + 1) / 2) calculates the sum of the first i integers.

**Pseudocode:**
```
1. Start
2. Set n to the absolute value of the integer input
3. Initialize i to 0
4. Repeat indefinitely:
    a. Calculate s as the sum of the first i integers: s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
    b. Calculate m as the difference between s and n: m = s - n
    c. If s is equal to n:
        i. Print i
        ii. Exit the loop
    d. Else if s is greater than n:
        i. If m is an even number:
            A. Print i
            B. Exit the loop
    e. Increment i by 1
5. End
```

**Explanation of Components:**
- **Variables**: 
  - `n`: Input value that we want to match the summation against.
  - `i`: A counter used to compute sums incrementally.
  - `s`: The sum of the first `i` integers.
  - `m`: The difference between the computed sum `s` and the input `n`.

- **Loop**:
  - The loop continues until a specific condition is met (either finding a match or meeting the conditions for even adjustments).

- **Conditions**:
  - It checks if the current sum `s` equals `n` or exceeds it and whether the excess `m` is even.

This structured pseudocode clearly conveys the logic of the original code while being easily understandable.
