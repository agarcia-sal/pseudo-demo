Here is the pseudocode that captures the logic and flow of the provided code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Get the absolute value of the user input
    userInput = Read an integer from input
    targetValue = Absolute value of userInput

    // Step 2: Initialize a counter variable
    index = 0

    // Step 3: Start an infinite loop to find the required index
    WHILE TRUE DO
        
        // Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers
        sum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2

        // Step 5: Calculate the difference from the target value
        difference = sum - targetValue

        // Step 6: Check if the current sum equals the target value
        IF sum EQUALS targetValue THEN
            PRINT index
            BREAK   // Exit the loop if we found a match

        // Step 7: Check if the current sum exceeds the target value
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN targetValue THEN
            
            // Step 8: Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT index
                BREAK   // Exit the loop if the difference is even

        // Step 9: Increment the index for the next iteration
        index = index + 1

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer input from the user and takes its absolute value to handle both positive and negative inputs.

2. **Initialization**: A variable `index` is initialized to keep track of the current integer being considered in the sequence.

3. **Looping Mechanism**: An infinite loop is used to repeatedly calculate the sum of integers up to the current index.

4. **Sum Calculation**: The sum is calculated using a mathematical formula which represents the sum of the first `index` natural numbers.

5. **Difference Calculation**: The difference between the calculated sum and the target value is computed to check if any specific conditions are fulfilled.

6. **Conditional Checks**: The program checks if the current sum equals the target value. If true, it outputs the current index. If the sum exceeds the target value, it checks whether the difference is even.

7. **Incrementing the Index**: If none of the conditions are satisfied, the index is incremented, and the loop continues until a valid output is produced.

This structured pseudocode aims to clearly express the algorithm's intent without relying on specific coding syntax, making it accessible to individuals unfamiliar with the original code.
