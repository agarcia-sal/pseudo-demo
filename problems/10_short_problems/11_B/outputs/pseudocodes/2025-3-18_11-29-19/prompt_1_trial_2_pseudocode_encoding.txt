**Pseudocode: Finding the Minimum Non-Negative Integer Based on Sum**

1. **Input:** Read an integer value from the user and take its absolute value. Assign this value to a variable named `targetSum`.

2. **Initialize Variables:** 
   - Set a variable `index` to 0.

3. **Loop Until Condition is Met:** 
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

     a. **Calculate Sum:** 
        - Compute the sum of the first `index` integers using the formula for the sum of a series, which is `sumOfIntegers = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`.

     b. **Calculate Difference:** 
        - Determine the difference between the sum of integers and the target sum: `difference = sumOfIntegers - targetSum`.

     c. **Check for Exact Match:** 
        - If `sumOfIntegers` is equal to `targetSum`, then:
           - Output the current value of `index`.
           - Exit the loop.

     d. **Check for Greater Sum:**
        - If `sumOfIntegers` is greater than `targetSum`, then:
           - If `difference` is even:
             - Output the current value of `index`.
             - Exit the loop.

     e. **Increment Index:** 
        - Increase `index` by 1.
