**Pseudocode:**

1. Start by defining an input variable named `absoluteInput` to store the absolute value of an integer provided by the user.
2. Initialize a variable `index` to zero, which will be used to track the current number during the calculation process.
3. Enter an infinite loop that will continue until a break condition is met.
    - Within the loop, calculate the sum of the first `index` natural numbers and store the result in a variable named `sumIndex`.
    - Compute the difference between `sumIndex` and `absoluteInput`, storing it in a variable called `difference`.
    
4. Check if `sumIndex` is equal to `absoluteInput`:
    - If they are equal, output the value of `index` as a valid result and exit the loop.

5. If `sumIndex` is greater than `absoluteInput`, proceed to check the following:
    - If `difference` is even (meaning it can be evenly divided by 2):
        - If true, output the value of `index` as a valid result and exit the loop.

6. Increment the value of `index` by one to prepare for the next iteration of the loop.

7. End the process when a valid output has been produced. 

**Inputs required:**
- An integer provided by the user which will be processed to find the absolute value.

**Outputs produced:**
- The index of the natural numbers that satisfy the conditions based on the calculations performed within the loop.
