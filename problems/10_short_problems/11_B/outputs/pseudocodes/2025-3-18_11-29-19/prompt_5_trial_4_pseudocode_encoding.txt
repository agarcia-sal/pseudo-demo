**Purpose:** This code determines a specific integer based on a mathematical relationship involving triangular numbers. It searches for an integer \( i \) such that the \( i \)-th triangular number equals a given non-negative integer input, or it finds \( i \) when the excess of the triangular number over the input is even.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Get input from the user and convert it to a non-negative integer
    SET userInput TO absolute value of integer(input)
    
    // Step 2: Initialize a counter variable to track the current triangular number index
    SET index TO 0
    
    // Step 3: Create an infinite loop to search for the desired index
    WHILE TRUE DO
        
        // Step 4: Calculate the current triangular number
        SET triangularNumber TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Step 5: Calculate the difference between the triangular number and user input
        SET difference TO triangularNumber - userInput
        
        // Step 6: Check if the triangular number is equal to the user input
        IF triangularNumber IS EQUAL TO userInput THEN
            // Step 6a: Print the found index and exit the loop
            PRINT index
            BREAK
        
        // Step 7: Check if the triangular number exceeds the user input
        ELSE IF triangularNumber IS GREATER THAN userInput THEN
            // Step 7a: Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MOD 2 EQUAL TO 0 THEN
                // Step 7b: Print the index since the difference is even and exit the loop
                PRINT index
                BREAK
        
        // Step 8: Increment the index to check the next triangular number in the next iteration
        INCREMENT index BY 1
    END WHILE
END
```

**Annotations:**
- The program uses a while loop to continuously compute triangular numbers until it finds a particular condition that matches the input or leads to an even difference.
- The use of integer division ensures that we calculate the triangular numbers correctly (as integers).
- Comments throughout the pseudocode are provided to explain the purpose of each step clearly, aiding any reader's understanding of the logic without needing to know programming syntax.
