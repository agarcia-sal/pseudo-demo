Here is the pseudocode that encapsulates the logic of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION findNumberForTriangleNumber()
    // Get the absolute value of the user's input and convert it to an integer
    SET userInput TO absolute value of user input converted to integer
    INITIALIZE index TO 0  // This will track the current triangular number's position

    WHILE True DO
        // Calculate the current triangular number using the formula n(n + 1) / 2
        SET triangularNumber TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the current triangular number and the input
        SET difference TO triangularNumber - userInput

        // Check if the current triangular number equals the user input
        IF triangularNumber EQUALS userInput THEN
            PRINT index  // Output the current index
            BREAK  // Exit the loop

        // Check if the current triangular number exceeds the user input
        ELSE IF triangularNumber GREATER THAN userInput THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULUS 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT index  // Output the current index
                BREAK  // Exit the loop

        // Increment the index for the next triangular number calculation
        INCREMENT index BY 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Complexity
The code is designed to find the smallest integer index such that either the triangular number at that index matches the user's input or the difference from the input (when the triangular number exceeds the input) is even. It uses a loop that continues indefinitely until one of the exit conditions is met, making it functionally simple but potentially infinite in theory if no inputs are valid; however, in practice, it will eventually find a solution for any non-negative integer input. This means the algorithm relies on the mathematical properties of triangular numbers.
