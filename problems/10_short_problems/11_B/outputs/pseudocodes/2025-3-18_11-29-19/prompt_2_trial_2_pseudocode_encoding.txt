1. Begin by prompting the user to provide an integer value.
2. Take the absolute value of the input integer and store it in a variable called "targetSum."
3. Initialize a counter variable called "index" to zero.
4. Enter an indefinite loop that continues until a break condition is met:
   a. Calculate the sum of the first "index" natural numbers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, and store the result in a variable named "currentSum."
   b. Calculate the difference between "currentSum" and "targetSum," and store this value in a variable called "difference."
   c. Check if "currentSum" is equal to "targetSum":
      - If they are equal, output the value of "index" and exit the loop.
   d. If "currentSum" is greater than "targetSum":
      - Check if "difference" is an even number:
         - If it is even, output the value of "index" and exit the loop.
   e. Increment the "index" variable by one to continue the next iteration.
5. The program ends when an appropriate index is found and output.
