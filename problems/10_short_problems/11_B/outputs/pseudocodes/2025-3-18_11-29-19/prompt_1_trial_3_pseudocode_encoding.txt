**Pseudocode Description:**

1. **Input**: Read an integer value from the user and store it as `n`. Ensure `n` is a non-negative value by taking its absolute value.
2. **Initialization**: Set a counter variable `i` to 0.
3. **Looping Process**: Repeat the following steps indefinitely:
    - Calculate the sum `s` of the first `i` integers using the formula `s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2`.
    - Determine the difference `m` by subtracting `n` from `s`.
    - **Check Conditions**:
        - If `s` is equal to `n`, output the value of `i` and exit the loop.
        - If `s` is greater than `n`, check if the difference `m` is even. If it is, output the value of `i` and exit the loop.
    - Increment the counter variable `i` by 1.

4. **Output**: The program will output the integer `i` that satisfies one of the conditions above.
