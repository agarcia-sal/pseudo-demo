Sure! Here is a clear and understandable pseudocode representing the logic of the provided code:

```
1. Start
2. Read an integer value from user input, convert it to absolute value, and assign it to variable 'n'.
3. Initialize variable 'i' to 0.

4. Repeat forever (infinite loop):
    a. Calculate the sum 's' as the result of the formula: 
       s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2  
       (This is the sum of the first 'i' natural numbers.)
       
    b. Calculate the difference 'm' between 's' and 'n':
       m = s - n

    c. If 's' is equal to 'n':
        i. Print the value of 'i'.
        ii. Exit the loop.

    d. If 's' is greater than 'n':
        i. If 'm' is an even number (m % 2 equals 0):
            1. Print the value of 'i'.
            2. Exit the loop.

    e. Increment 'i' by 1 (i = i + 1).
    
5. End
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode starts by getting the absolute value of the number entered by the user, helping to ensure the algorithm can handle negative inputs consistently.
- Then it enters a loop where it calculates the sum of the first 'i' natural numbers and checks if this sum matches or exceeds 'n'.
- If the sum equals 'n', it prints the value of 'i'.
- If the sum exceeds 'n', it checks if the difference (m) between the sum and 'n' is even before printing 'i'.
- The loop continues until one of the conditions to print 'i' and break the loop is satisfied.
