**Purpose Summary**: The goal of this algorithm is to find a non-negative integer whose triangular number is either equal to or exceeds a given non-negative integer, and to print that integer under specific conditions.

**Pseudocode**:

```
BEGIN

    // Read the absolute value of an integer input from the user
    SET inputNumber AS absolute value of integer input
    SET index AS 0  // This will be used to find the triangular number

    // Start an infinite loop to calculate triangular numbers
    WHILE true DO
        
        // Calculate the triangular number for the current index
        SET triangularNumber AS (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between triangular number and input number
        SET difference AS triangularNumber - inputNumber
        
        // Check if the triangular number equals the input number
        IF triangularNumber EQUALS inputNumber THEN
            PRINT index     // Print the current index
            BREAK           // Exit the loop
        
        // If the triangular number exceeds the input number
        ELSE IF triangularNumber GREATER THAN inputNumber THEN
            
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT index     // Print the current index
                BREAK           // Exit the loop
        
        // Move to the next index
        SET index AS index + 1
    
END
```

**Key Components Explained**:

- **Input Handling**: The code begins by obtaining a non-negative integer input and ensuring it is non-negative (taking the absolute value).
  
- **Triangular Number Calculation**: The program uses a formula to compute triangular numbers sequentially as the index increments.

- **Condition Checking**: It evaluates whether the triangular number is equal to, or greater than the input number and checks the evenness of the difference when necessary.

- **Output**: The program prints the index when it finds a suitable triangular number according to the outlined conditions. 

Each step is designed to be easy to understand, ensuring that anyone reads it can follow the logic without needing to understand programming syntax.
