**Pseudocode:**

1. Begin the program.
2. Prompt the user for input and store the absolute value of the integer input as `targetValue`.
3. Initialize a counter variable `index` to 0.
4. Start an indefinite loop to continue processing until a specific condition is met.
   1. Calculate the sum `currentSum` of the first `index` natural numbers using the formula `(index * (index + 1)) / 2`.
   2. Calculate `difference` as `currentSum - targetValue`.
   3. Check if `currentSum` is equal to `targetValue`.
      - If they are equal, print the current value of `index` and exit the loop.
   4. Check if `currentSum` is greater than `targetValue`.
      - If it is, check if `difference` is an even number.
        - If `difference` is even, print the current value of `index` and exit the loop.
   5. Increment the value of `index` by 1.
5. End the program. 

**Input Requirement:** The program requires an integer input from the user which will be converted to its absolute value. 

**Output Requirement:** The program outputs a number, which is the value of `index` when either of the specified conditions is satisfied.
