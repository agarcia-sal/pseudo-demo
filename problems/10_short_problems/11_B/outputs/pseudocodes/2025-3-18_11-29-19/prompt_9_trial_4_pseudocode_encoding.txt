**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to determine a specific non-negative integer based on its relationship with the sum of the first 'i' natural numbers.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program**
   
2. **Receive Input**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number.
   - Convert the input to an integer and store it as the absolute value in a variable called `targetNumber`.

3. **Initialize a Counter**
   - Create a variable called `index` and set it to 0.

4. **Begin an Infinite Loop**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

5. **Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers**
   - Calculate the sum of the first `index` natural numbers using the formula:  
     `sumOfNaturalNumbers = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`

6. **Determine the Difference from Target Number**
   - Calculate the difference between `sumOfNaturalNumbers` and `targetNumber` and store this value in a variable called `difference`.

7. **Check for Conditions**
   - If `sumOfNaturalNumbers` is equal to `targetNumber`:
     - Print the value of `index`.
     - Exit the loop.
   - Else if `sumOfNaturalNumbers` is greater than `targetNumber`:
     - If `difference` is even:
       - Print the value of `index`.
       - Exit the loop.

8. **Increment the Counter**
   - Increase the value of `index` by 1.

9. **End the Program** 

This pseudocode maintains the core logic of the original code while enhancing clarity and abstraction, making it more accessible and easier to understand.
