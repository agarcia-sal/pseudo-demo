Hereâ€™s the pseudocode based on the provided code, following the guided steps:

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set `n` to the absolute value of the integer input from the user.
   - Set `i` to 0.

2. **Start an Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat indefinitely until a break condition is met.

     a. **Calculate Sum:**
        - Set `s` to the sum of the first `i` integers: `s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2`.

     b. **Calculate Difference:**
        - Set `m` to the difference between `s` and `n`: `m = s - n`.

     c. **Check for Exact Match:**
        - If `s` is equal to `n`, then:
            - Print `i`.
            - Exit the loop.

     d. **Check for Overreach:**
        - If `s` is greater than `n`, then:
            - If `m` is even (i.e., `m % 2 equals 0`), then:
                - Print `i`.
                - Exit the loop.

     e. **Increment Counter:**
        - Increase `i` by 1.

---

**Assumptions:**
- The input from the user is a valid integer.
- The program will stop executing when either condition (exact match or even difference) is met.
- The variable `n` will always be non-negative due to the use of the absolute value function.

**Notes:**
- The pseudocode maintains clarity by specifying the conditions and actions clearly.
- Variables and operations are defined explicitly to ensure readability and understanding without the need for programming language syntax.
