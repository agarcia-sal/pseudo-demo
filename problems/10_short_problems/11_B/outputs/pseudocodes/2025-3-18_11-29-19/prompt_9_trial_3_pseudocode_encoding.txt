**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose triangular number is equal to or greater than a given positive integer, and if greater, check if the difference is even.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Get User Input:**
   - Read a number from the user and convert it to a positive integer.

3. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set a counter named 'current_number' to 0.

4. **Begin an Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

    a. **Calculate the Triangular Number:**
       - Calculate the triangular number for 'current_number' using the formula:
         - triangular_number = (current_number * (current_number + 1)) / 2

    b. **Calculate the Difference:**
       - Calculate the difference between the triangular number and the input number:
         - difference = triangular_number - input_number

    c. **Check for Equality:**
       - If triangular_number is equal to the input number:
         - Print 'current_number'
         - Exit the loop

    d. **Check for Greater Value:**
       - Else if triangular_number is greater than the input number:
         - If difference is even:
           - Print 'current_number'
           - Exit the loop

    e. **Increment the Counter:**
       - Increase 'current_number' by 1.

5. **End** 

This pseudocode clearly outlines the steps taken in the original code, focusing on the logic and flow without getting bogged down by specific programming syntax.
