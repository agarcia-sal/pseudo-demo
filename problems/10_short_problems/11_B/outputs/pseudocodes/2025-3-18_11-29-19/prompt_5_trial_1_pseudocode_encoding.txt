**Purpose:** The goal of the code is to find the smallest non-negative integer \( i \) such that either the sum of the first \( i \) integers equals a given non-negative integer \( n \) or that this sum exceeds \( n \) and the difference between the sum and \( n \) is an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# Step 1: Accept absolute value input from the user
number = absolute_value_of(input_as_integer())

# Step 2: Initialize a counter variable
index = 0

# Step 3: Infinite loop to find the required integer
repeat indefinitely:
    # Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers
    sum_first_index = sum_of_first_n_integers(index)

    # Calculate the difference between the sum and the input number
    difference = sum_first_index - number

    # Step 4: Check if the sum matches the input number
    if sum_first_index equals number then:
        print(index)  # Output the current index
        exit loop     # Stop the loop as we found the solution
    
    # Step 5: Check if the sum exceeds the input number
    else if sum_first_index greater than number then:
        # Check if the difference is even
        if difference is divisible by 2 then:
            print(index)  # Output the current index
            exit loop     # Stop the loop as we found the solution
    
    # Step 6: Increment the counter to check the next integer
    index = index + 1
```

**Comments Explanation:**
- The code begins by accepting a non-negative integer input from the user, ensuring that it works with its absolute value.
- It systematically calculates the sum of the first \( i \) integers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
- In each iteration, it checks two main conditions: whether the current sum equals the desired number or whether the sum exceeds it with an appropriate condition regarding the evenness of the difference.
- The loop continues until a valid index is found, which is then printed as output.
