**Purpose**: The primary goal of this code is to determine and output a specific integer (i) based on user input (n). The integer i is such that the sum of the first i natural numbers either equals n or exceeds n by an even number.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Get User Input**
   - Initialize `number` as the absolute value of the integer received from the user input.

2. **Initialize Counter**
   - Set `counter` to zero.

3. **Start Infinite Loop**
   - Repeat indefinitely:
     - Calculate `sum_of_first_i` as the sum of the first `counter` natural numbers using the formula: `sum_of_first_i = counter * (counter + 1) / 2`
     - Calculate `difference` as `sum_of_first_i - number`.

4. **Check Conditions**
   - If `sum_of_first_i` equals `number`:
       - Output `counter`
       - Exit the loop.
   - Else if `sum_of_first_i` is greater than `number`:
       - If `difference` is even:
           - Output `counter`
           - Exit the loop.

5. **Increment Counter**
   - Increase `counter` by 1.

**Comments**:
- The loop continues to calculate the cumulative sum of natural numbers until a suitable `counter` is found that satisfies either of the conditions.
- The `difference` being even is a crucial check to determine if the integer can be represented in the desired form when the sum exceeds `number`. 

**Example**:
- If the user inputs 3, the process calculates the sums (0, 1, 3, 6, ...) and checks if the conditions are met. It would output 2 when it reaches the sum 3 exactly on the third iteration.

This pseudocode format maintains simplicity and clarity while conveying the necessary logic of the original code.
