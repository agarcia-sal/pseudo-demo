Here's the translated pseudocode following your guided steps:

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize variables:**
   - Set `n` to the absolute value of the integer input.
   - Set `i` to 0.

2. **Start infinite loop:**
   - While true do:
     1. **Calculate the sum of first i integers:** 
        - Set `s` to `(i * (i + 1)) / 2`
     2. **Calculate the difference:** 
        - Set `m` to `s - n`
     3. **Check if the sum equals n:**
        - If `s` is equal to `n` then:
          - Print `i`
          - Exit the loop
     4. **Check if the sum exceeds n:**
        - Else if `s` is greater than `n` then:
          - If `m` is even then:
            - Print `i`
            - Exit the loop
     5. **Increment i by 1:**
        - Increase `i` by 1

**Assumptions:**
- The input is a valid integer. 
- The input, after being processed through `abs()` and `int()`, is non-negative. 

**Clarifications:**
- The use of "Print" indicates outputting the value of `i` to the user.
- The condition to check "evenness" of `m` uses a modulus operation which is understood to mean "if `m` can be divided by 2 with no remainder."
