**Pseudocode Translation:**

``` 
1. DEFINE n AS (absolute value of the integer input)
2. INITIALIZE i TO 0

3. WHILE TRUE DO
    4.   SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) DIVIDED BY 2
    5.   SET m TO (s - n)

    6.   IF s EQUALS n THEN
         7.     PRINT i
         8.     EXIT the loop

    9.   ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
         10.    IF m MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
               11.        PRINT i
               12.        EXIT the loop

    13.   INCREMENT i BY 1
END WHILE
```

**Assumptions:**
- The variable `n` can be any non-negative integer input provided by the user.
- The `abs()` function returns the absolute value of its argument.
- The value of `i` starts at 0 and increments in each iteration of the loop.
- The logic checks for special cases when `s` is equal to or greater than `n`.

**Explanation of Components:**
- **Variable Definitions:** Initializing `n` and `i` correctly to store user input and to control the loop.
- **Loop Structure:** A `WHILE TRUE` loop allows continuous checks until a condition is met to exit.
- **Conditional Checks:** Managing the logic using `IF`, `ELSE IF`, and `ELSE` statements to determine when to print `i` and exit.
- **Mathematical Operations:** Clearly defines the operations involved in computing `s` and `m`.
