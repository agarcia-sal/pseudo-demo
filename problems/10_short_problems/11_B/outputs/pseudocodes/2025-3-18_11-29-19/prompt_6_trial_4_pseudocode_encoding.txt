Hereâ€™s the pseudocode derived from the provided code, capturing its logic in a clear and comprehensible manner:

```
BEGIN

    // Get the absolute value of the user input and store it as an integer
    SET targetNumber TO absoluteValue OF (inputNumber)

    // Initialize an index counter
    SET index TO 0

    // Start an infinite loop to find the solution
    WHILE TRUE DO

        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
        SET sum TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the current sum and target number
        SET difference TO (sum - targetNumber)

        // Check if the current sum is equal to the target number
        IF sum EQUALS targetNumber THEN
            // If they are equal, print the current index and exit the loop
            PRINT index
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the current sum exceeds the target number
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN targetNumber THEN
            // Check if the difference is an even number
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                // If the difference is even, print the current index and exit the loop
                PRINT index
                BREAK
        
        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        INCREMENT index BY 1

END
```

### Explanation of Key Components:
- **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading a number and computing its absolute value.
- **Loop**: An infinite loop is initiated to calculate and check the cumulative sum of numbers starting from zero until a condition is met.
- **Conditions**: It checks whether the cumulative sum matches the input number or exceeds it and whether the difference is even, leading to a decision to print the index if the criteria are satisfied.
- **Incrementing the Counter**: The index increases by one in each iteration to explore the next number in the series. 

This pseudocode provides a clear structure and flows logically through the problem while maintaining an easy-to-follow format.
