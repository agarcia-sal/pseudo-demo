**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Obtain a number from the user and take its absolute value. Let's call this number "targetValue."
3. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set a variable "index" to 0.
4. **Infinite Loop:**
   - Continuously perform the following steps:
     a. Calculate the sum of the first "index" natural numbers. This is done by using the formula: "currentSum = (index * (index + 1)) divided by 2."
     b. Calculate the difference between "currentSum" and "targetValue." Denote this difference as "difference."
     c. **Check if sum equals targetValue:**
        - If "currentSum" is equal to "targetValue," then:
          - Output the value of "index."
          - Terminate the loop.
     d. **Check if sum exceeds targetValue:**
        - If "currentSum" is greater than "targetValue," then:
          - If "difference" is an even number:
            - Output the value of "index."
            - Terminate the loop.
     e. **Increment the counter:**
        - Increase the value of "index" by 1.
5. **End** 

**Output:**
- The program outputs the value of "index" that satisfies either condition of equality or even difference based on the sum of natural numbers compared to the given input.
