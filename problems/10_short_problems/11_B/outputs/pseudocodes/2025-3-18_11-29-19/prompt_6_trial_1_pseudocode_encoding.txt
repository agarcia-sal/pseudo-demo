**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Read input value and convert it to a positive integer
    SET targetNumber = absolute value of the integer input

    // Initialize a counter to track the current step
    SET stepCounter = 0

    // Start an infinite loop to find the solution
    WHILE true DO

        // Calculate the sum of the first 'stepCounter' natural numbers
        SET currentSum = (stepCounter * (stepCounter + 1)) / 2

        // Calculate the difference between currentSum and targetNumber
        SET difference = currentSum - targetNumber

        // Check if the currentSum is equal to the targetNumber
        IF currentSum is equal to targetNumber THEN
            PRINT stepCounter
            BREAK the loop

        // Check if currentSum is greater than targetNumber
        ELSE IF currentSum is greater than targetNumber THEN
            
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference is even THEN
                PRINT stepCounter
                BREAK the loop

        // Increment the stepCounter for the next iteration
        INCREMENT stepCounter by 1

    END WHILE

END
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by accepting an input and ensuring that it is treated as a positive number for calculations.
2. **Loop Mechanism**: It uses a while loop that continues until either of the defined conditions is met (i.e., it finds the step count or reaches a point where it can determine the result).
3. **Mathematical Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers in each iteration and compares this sum to the target value.
4. **Output Requirements**: It prints the step count when the condition is satisfied and exits the loop.
5. **Increment Logic**: After checking conditions, it increments the counter for the next loop iteration. 

This structure and flow should be easily understandable for users unfamiliar with programming.
