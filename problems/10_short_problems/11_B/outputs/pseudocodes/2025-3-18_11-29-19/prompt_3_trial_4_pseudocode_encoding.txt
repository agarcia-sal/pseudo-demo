Here is the pseudocode representation of the given code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Read an integer input and take its absolute value
    SET userInput TO ABSOLUTE_VALUE(TO_INTEGER(READ_INPUT()))

    // Initialize a variable to keep count
    SET counter TO 0

    // Start an infinite loop to find the result
    WHILE TRUE DO 
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'counter' natural numbers
        SET sum TO (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and userInput
        SET difference TO sum - userInput
        
        // Check if the calculated sum equals the userInput
        IF sum EQUALS userInput THEN
            // Print the current counter value and exit the loop
            PRINT counter
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the calculated sum exceeds userInput
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN userInput THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                // Print the current counter value and exit the loop
                PRINT counter
                BREAK
        
        // Increment the counter for the next iteration
        INCREMENT counter BY 1

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts with reading user input and taking its absolute value to ensure it is non-negative.

2. **Initialization:** A counter is initialized to track how many natural numbers have been summed.

3. **Loop Structure:** An infinite loop is employed to continuously calculate the sum of the first few natural numbers. 

4. **Sum Calculation:** Within the loop, the sum of the first `counter` natural numbers is calculated.

5. **Condition Checks:**
   - The code first checks if the summed value equals the user input and if so, it prints the counter and exits.
   - If the sum exceeds the user input, it then checks if the difference is even.
   - If the difference is even, the program prints the counter and exits.

6. **Incrementing the Counter:** If none of the conditions are satisfied, the counter is incremented to check the next number in the following iteration. 

This structured pseudocode transforms the original code into a clear and logical flow, making the algorithm's purpose and functionality understandable at a high level.
