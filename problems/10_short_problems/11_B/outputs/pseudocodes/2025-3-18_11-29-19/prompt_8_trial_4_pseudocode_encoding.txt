**Objective:** The purpose of the following pseudocode is to determine a specific integer based on a calculation involving triangular numbers and their difference from the absolute value of an input number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Begin the Program**
   
2. **Receive Input**:
   - Read a number from the user
   - Convert the number to its absolute value and store it in `absoluteNumber`

3. **Initialize the Counter**:
   - Set a counter `index` to 0

4. **Loop Until a Condition is Met**:
   - Start an infinite loop:
     - Calculate the triangular number using the formula:
       - `triangularNumber = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`
     - Calculate the difference from the input:
       - `difference = triangularNumber - absoluteNumber`
     
     - **Check Conditions**:
       - If `triangularNumber` equals `absoluteNumber`:
         - Print the current value of `index`
         - Exit the loop
       - Else if `triangularNumber` is greater than `absoluteNumber`:
         - Check if `difference` is even (`difference % 2 == 0`):
           - If it is even:
             - Print the current value of `index`
             - Exit the loop

     - Increment `index` by 1

5. **End the Program**

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The triangular number is calculated as the sum of the first `index` integers.
- The program continues searching for a valid `index` until it finds an integer where either the triangular number matches the input value or the difference from the input value is even. This ensures the answer meets the required conditions.
- This approach guarantees that we explore possible values systematically by incrementing the `index` until we find a suitable solution.
