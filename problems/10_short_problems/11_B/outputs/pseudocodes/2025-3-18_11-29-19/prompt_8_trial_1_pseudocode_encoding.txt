**Purpose Summary:**
The goal of the following pseudocode is to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` such that either the sum of the first `i` integers equals a given non-negative integer `n` or exceeds `n` by an even number. 

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Input:**
   - Read a number from input and convert it to a positive integer (absolute value). Store it in a variable named `targetSum`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a variable `currentIndex` and set it to 0. This variable will keep track of the current integer being evaluated.

3. **Repeat Until Found:**
   - Start an infinite loop:
     1. Calculate `currentSum` as the sum of the first `currentIndex` integers:
        - This is done using the formula: `currentSum = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2`.
     2. Calculate the difference `difference` as `currentSum - targetSum`.
     
     3. **Check Conditions:**
        - If `currentSum` equals `targetSum`, then:
          - Print `currentIndex` (as we have found our solution).
          - Exit the loop.
        - If `currentSum` is greater than `targetSum`:
          - Check if `difference` is even (i.e., `difference % 2 == 0`):
            - If it is even, then:
              - Print `currentIndex` (solution found as `currentSum` exceeds `targetSum` by an even number).
              - Exit the loop.
     4. Increment `currentIndex` by 1 (to evaluate the next integer).

**End of Pseudocode**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- We use `abs(int(input()))` to ensure that we are only working with non-negative integers, as negative integers do not apply in this context.
- The `while True` loop continues until a valid `currentIndex` is found, ensuring we search through all possible sums.
- The checks for equality and evenness are crucial to determine whether the current index is a valid solution or if further searching is required. 

This structure ensures that someone reading the pseudocode without programming experience can still understand the logic and purpose of the code.
