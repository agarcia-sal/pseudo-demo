**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to find a non-negative integer \( i \) such that the sum of the first \( i \) integers equals a specified input number, or can be adjusted by subtracting an even number to match the input number.

**Pseudocode:**
1. **Receive Input:**
   - Get a number from the user and convert it to a non-negative integer.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a counter \( i \) to 0.

3. **Start an Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

   4. **Calculate the Sum:**
      - Calculate the sum of the first \( i \) integers using the formula:
        - \( \text{sum} = \frac{i \times (i + 1)}{2} \)

   5. **Determine the Difference:**
      - Calculate the difference between the sum and the user-input number:
        - \( \text{difference} = \text{sum} - \text{input number} \)

   6. **Check for Exact Match:**
      - If the sum is exactly equal to the input number:
        - Print the value of \( i \)
        - Exit the loop.

   7. **Check for Exceeding Sum:**
      - If the sum is greater than the input number:
        - If the difference is an even number:
          - Print the value of \( i \)
          - Exit the loop.

   8. **Increment the Counter:**
      - Increase the value of \( i \) by 1.

**Output:** The algorithm prints the integer \( i \) when it either finds the exact sum or determines that an adjustment (by subtracting an even number) can yield the input number.
