**Pseudocode:**

1. Start by accepting a number from user input, called "absoluteValue", and ensure it is a non-negative integer.
  
2. Initialize a variable "index" to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current index being checked.

3. Enter an infinite loop that will continue until a solution is found:
   - Calculate the sum "sumOfIndex" using the formula for the sum of the first "index" natural numbers, which is: index multiplied by (index plus 1) divided by 2.
   - Calculate the difference "difference" by subtracting "absoluteValue" from "sumOfIndex".

4. Check the following conditions in order:
   - If "sumOfIndex" is equal to "absoluteValue":
     - Print the value of "index" and exit the loop, as a solution has been found.
   - If "sumOfIndex" is greater than "absoluteValue":
     - Check if "difference" is an even number:
       - If it is even, print the value of "index" and exit the loop, as this is also a valid solution.

5. Increment the value of "index" by 1 to consider the next index in the next iteration of the loop.

6. End program execution once a valid solution has been printed. 

**Input Requirement:** 
- A non-negative integer from the user.

**Output Requirement:** 
- Either the value of "index" that satisfies the conditions described or exits without output if no valid index can be found.
