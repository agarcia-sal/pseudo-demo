**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to find a non-negative integer that, when added to the sum of the first 'i' integers, results in a specified absolute input value.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input:**
   - Receive a number from the user and store it as 'targetValue'. 
   - Calculate the absolute value of 'targetValue' so that it is always non-negative.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set 'currentIndex' to 0.

3. **Loop:**
   - Repeat indefinitely (i.e., create an infinite loop):
     - Calculate 'sumOfIntegers' as the total of the first 'currentIndex' integers using the formula `currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1) / 2`.
     - Compute 'difference' as the difference between 'sumOfIntegers' and 'targetValue'.

     - **Check Conditions:**
       - If 'sumOfIntegers' equals 'targetValue':
         - Output 'currentIndex' (the index where the equality occurs) and exit the loop.
       - Else if 'sumOfIntegers' is greater than 'targetValue':
         - If 'difference' is even:
           - Output 'currentIndex' (since the difference can be balanced) and exit the loop.
          
     - Increment 'currentIndex' by 1 to examine the next integer.

**Output:**
   - The program will print either the value of 'currentIndex' where the condition is satisfied or continue iterating until one of the conditions is met.

This pseudocode outlines the algorithm's main purpose and flow clearly while abstracting any specific programming language syntax, making it accessible and understandable to a wide audience.
