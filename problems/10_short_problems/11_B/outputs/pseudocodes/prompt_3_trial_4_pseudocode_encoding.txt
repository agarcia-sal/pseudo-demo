// Start of the pseudocode

// Read an integer input and store its absolute value
SET absoluteValue TO absolute of integer input

// Initialize a counter variable 
SET index TO 0

// Begin an infinite loop to find the required index
WHILE true DO
    // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
    SET sum TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between the sum and the absolute value input
    SET difference TO sum - absoluteValue
    
    // Check if the sum is equal to the absolute value input
    IF sum is equal to absoluteValue THEN
        // Print the current index as the output
        PRINT index
        // Exit the loop as the desired index is found

    // Check if the sum is greater than the absolute value input
    ELSE IF sum is greater than absoluteValue THEN
