**Pseudocode: Find the Largest Integer with Specific Properties**

**Input:** 
- A non-negative integer `n` obtained from user input.

**Output:** 
- The largest integer `i` such that the sum of the first `i` natural numbers equals `n` or the sum exceeds `n` and the difference is an even number.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize `n` as the absolute value of user input converted to an integer.
2. Set a counter `i` to 0.
3. Start an infinite loop (repeat forever):
   a. Calculate the sum of the first `i` natural numbers and store it in `s`. 
      - Formula: `s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2`
   b. Compute the difference `m` between the sum `s` and `n`: 
      - `m = s - n`
   c. If `s` is equal to `n`:
      - Print the value of `i`.
      - Exit the loop.
   d. Else if `s` is greater than `n`:
      - If the difference `m` is an even number:
         - Print the value of `i`.
         - Exit the loop.
   e. Increment `i` by 1 to check the next integer.

4. End of algorithm.
