**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Process**
2. **Take an Input:**
   - Obtain a number from the user and convert it to its absolute integer value.
   - Store this value in a variable named 'targetNumber'.

3. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set a variable 'index' to 0. This will be used to compute the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers.

4. **Begin an Infinite Loop:**
   - Inside this loop, perform the following steps:

     a. **Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers:**
        - Compute the sum of the first 'index' numbers using the formula: `sumOfIndex = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`.

     b. **Calculate the Difference:**
        - Determine the difference between the 'sumOfIndex' and 'targetNumber' by setting 'difference = sumOfIndex - targetNumber'.

     c. **Check for Exact Match:**
        - If 'sumOfIndex' is equal to 'targetNumber':
          - Output the current 'index' value.
          - Exit the loop.

     d. **Check if Sum Exceeds Target:**
        - If 'sumOfIndex' is greater than 'targetNumber':
          - Further check the 'difference':
            - If 'difference' is even (i.e., divisible by 2):
              - Output the current 'index' value.
              - Exit the loop.

     e. **Increment the Counter:**
        - Increase 'index' by 1 to evaluate the next natural number in the following iteration.

5. **End the Process** 

**Output Requirement:**
- The output should be the value of 'index' when a valid condition is met, either when 'sumOfIndex' equals 'targetNumber' or when 'sumOfIndex' exceeds 'targetNumber' and 'difference' is even.
