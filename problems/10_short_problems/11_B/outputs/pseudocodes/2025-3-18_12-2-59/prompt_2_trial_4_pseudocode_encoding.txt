**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start:**
   - Define a variable to hold the absolute value of an integer input by the user. Let this value be called `targetValue`.

2. **Initialize Counter:**
   - Set a counter variable, named `index`, to zero. This counter will be used to track the current position in our calculations.

3. **Continuous Loop:**
   - Begin an infinite loop that will continue until a condition is met to exit.

4. **Calculate Sum:**
   - Within the loop, calculate the triangular number corresponding to `index`, which is the sum of all integers from 0 to `index`. Let this calculated sum be called `triangularSum`.

5. **Determine Difference:**
   - Calculate the difference between `triangularSum` and `targetValue`. Store this difference in a variable named `difference`.

6. **Check Conditions:**
   - If `triangularSum` equals `targetValue`:
     - Output the current value of `index` as it represents a valid solution.
     - Exit the loop.
   - Else if `triangularSum` is greater than `targetValue`:
     - Check if `difference` is even:
       - If `difference` is even, output the current value of `index` as it represents another valid solution.
       - Exit the loop.

7. **Update Counter:**
   - Increment the `index` by 1 to continue the loop with the next integer.

8. **End:**
   - The program finishes after a valid solution has been found and outputted.
