Here's a clear and structured pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Get the absolute integer input
    SET number to absolute value of integer input

    // Step 2: Initialize index variable
    SET index to 0

    // Step 3: Start an infinite loop to find the desired result
    WHILE true DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
        SET sum to (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between sum and input number
        SET difference to sum - number
        
        // Step 4: Check if the sum equals the input number
        IF sum is equal to number THEN
            PRINT index    // Output the current index
            BREAK          // Exit the loop
        
        // Step 5: Check if sum exceeds the input number
        ELSE IF sum is greater than number THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference is even THEN
                PRINT index  // Output the current index
                BREAK        // Exit the loop
        
        // Step 6: Increment index for the next iteration
        INCREMENT index by 1
    END WHILE
END
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode
- **Input and Output:** The pseudocode begins by obtaining a number from user input and later prints an index value based on certain conditions.
- **Looping and Conditions:** It features a while loop that continues until a break condition is met. Inside the loop, it checks if the sum of natural numbers equals the input number or if the sum exceeds it while the difference is even.
- **Clarity and Readability:** The steps are clearly delineated, and control structures such as loops and conditional statements are expressed in simple, understandable language.
