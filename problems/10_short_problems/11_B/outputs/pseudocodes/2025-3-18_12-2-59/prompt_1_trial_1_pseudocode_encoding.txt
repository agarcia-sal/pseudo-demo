**Pseudocode:**

Begin execution

1. Get the absolute value of an integer from user input and store it in a variable `targetSum`.

2. Initialize a counter variable `index` to 0.

3. Start an infinite loop:
   a. Calculate the sum of the first `index` integers using the formula `sumOfIndices = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`.
   b. Calculate the difference between `sumOfIndices` and `targetSum`, storing it in `difference`.

   c. If `sumOfIndices` is equal to `targetSum`:
      - Print the value of `index`.
      - Exit the loop.
      
   d. Else if `sumOfIndices` is greater than `targetSum`:
      - Check if `difference` is even:
         - If it is, print the value of `index`.
         - Exit the loop.

   e. Increment `index` by 1.

End execution. 

**Output:** 
- The output will be either the index that satisfies the conditions or the proper index when certain conditions are met (inclusive of when the sum exactly equals the target).
