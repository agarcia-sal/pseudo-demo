**Pseudocode: Finding a Number Based on a Mathematical Condition**

1. **Input Phase:**
   - Start by getting the user input for a number, referred to as 'targetNumber'.
   - Calculate the absolute value of 'targetNumber' to ensure it's non-negative.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a counter variable 'index' to 0. This will be used to calculate a series of sums.

3. **Loop Phase:**
   - Begin an infinite loop to perform the following actions continuously until a condition is met:
     - Calculate 'sumOfIntegers' as the sum of all integers from 0 to 'index', using the formula for the sum of the first 'index' integers.
     - Calculate 'difference' by subtracting 'targetNumber' from 'sumOfIntegers'.

     - Check if 'sumOfIntegers' is equal to 'targetNumber':
       - If they are equal, this means we found the required 'index'. Display 'index' and exit the loop.

     - Check if 'sumOfIntegers' is greater than 'targetNumber':
       - If true, check if 'difference' is even:
         - If 'difference' is even, display 'index' as it satisfies the condition and exit the loop.

     - Increment 'index' by 1 to continue checking the next integer.

4. **Output Phase:**
   - The output is the value of 'index' which satisfies either of the conditions from the loop, printed to the user.
