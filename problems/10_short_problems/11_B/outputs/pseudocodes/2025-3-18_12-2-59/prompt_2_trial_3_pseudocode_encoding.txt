**Pseudocode for the Given Code:**

1. Start the program.
2. Prompt the user to enter a number and store this number as `inputNumber`.
3. Calculate the absolute value of `inputNumber` and assign it to `targetValue`.
4. Initialize a variable `index` to 0, which will be used to track our current position in a sequence.
5. Enter an infinite loop:
   - Calculate the sum of the first `index` natural numbers and store it as `sumValue`.
   - Determine the difference between `sumValue` and `targetValue` and store it as `difference`.
   - If `sumValue` is equal to `targetValue`:
     - Output the value of `index` to the user.
     - Exit the loop.
   - Else if `sumValue` is greater than `targetValue`:
     - Check if `difference` is an even number:
       - If true, output the value of `index` to the user.
       - Exit the loop.
   - Increment `index` by 1.
6. End the program.
