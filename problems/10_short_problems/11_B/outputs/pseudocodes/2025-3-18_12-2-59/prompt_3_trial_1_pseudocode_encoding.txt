Here is the pseudocode that reflects the logic of the provided code while adhering to the outlined instructions:

```
START

// Read input from the user
SET userInput TO ABSOLUTE VALUE OF INTEGER(INPUT)

// Initialize a counter
SET counter TO 0

// Loop indefinitely until a condition is met
WHILE true DO

    // Calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to counter
    SET sum TO (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2

    // Calculate the difference between sum and user input
    SET difference TO sum - userInput

    // Check if the sum equals the user input
    IF sum EQUALS userInput THEN
        // If they are equal, print the counter and break the loop
        PRINT counter
        BREAK

    // Check if the sum exceeds the user input
    ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN userInput THEN
        // Check if the difference is even
        IF difference MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
            // If difference is even, print the counter and break the loop
            PRINT counter
            BREAK

    // Increment the counter for the next iteration
    INCREMENT counter BY 1

END
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
- **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by reading an integer input from the user, ensuring it is a non-negative value.
- **Counter Initialization:** A counter is set to zero to keep track of the current number in the summation process.
- **Loop Structure:** An indefinite loop is established to repeatedly calculate the sum and check conditions.
- **Sum Calculation:** The sum of numbers from 0 to the current counter is calculated using the formula for the triangular number.
- **Conditional Checks:** The pseudocode features checks to see if the sum matches the user's input and whether the excess (difference) from the input is even.
- **Output:** If conditions are met, the current counter is printed, and the loop exits.
- **Counter Increment:** If none of the conditions are satisfied, the counter increments to test the next number in the subsequent iteration.

This structure ensures clarity on the logic and flow of the original code while avoiding specific programming syntax.
