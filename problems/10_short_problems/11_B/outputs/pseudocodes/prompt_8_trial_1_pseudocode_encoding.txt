**Purpose:** The code aims to find and print the smallest integer \( i \) such that the sum of the first \( i \) integers equals or exceeds a given absolute input number \( n \) and satisfies specific conditions regarding the difference between the sum and \( n \).

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input**
   - Declare a variable `inputNumber` and set it to the absolute value of the integer input from the user.

2. **Initialize Variables**
   - Declare a variable `i` and set it to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of integers being summed.

3. **Start Infinite Loop**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

     1. **Calculate Sum**
        - Calculate the sum of the first `i` integers by using the formula:
          - `sumOfFirstI = (i * (i + 1)) / 2`
     
     2. **Calculate Difference**
        - Calculate the difference between `sumOfFirstI` and `inputNumber`:
          - `difference = sumOfFirstI - inputNumber`
     
     3. **Check for Exact Match**
        - If `sumOfFirstI` is equal to `inputNumber`:
          - Print the value of `i`
          - Exit the loop.

     4. **Check for Greater Sum**
        - If `sumOfFirstI` is greater than `inputNumber`:
          - If `difference` is even:
            - Print the value of `i`
            - Exit the loop.
     
     5. **Increment Counter**
        - Increase the value of `i` by 1.

**Comment Section:**
- The variable `inputNumber` represents the target value to match or exceed.
- The variable `i` counts how many integers are added together.
- The sum of the first \( i \) integers is calculated using the formula for the summation of an arithmetic series.
- The loop continues until a valid sum is found that meets the conditions, ensuring efficiency by checking both for an exact match and evaluating the properties of the difference.

**Example Flow:**
- User inputs a number, say 3.
- Input is converted to absolute value (if negative).
- The loop begins calculating sums until it finds a suitable \( i \) or exceeds \( n \) with an even difference.
- Once found, it prints \( i \) and stops execution.
