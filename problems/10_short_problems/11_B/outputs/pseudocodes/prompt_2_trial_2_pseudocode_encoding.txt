**Pseudocode:**

1. Start the process by taking an input number representing a distance. Convert this number to its absolute value to ensure it is non-negative. Store this value in a variable called `targetDistance`.

2. Initialize a variable called `currentIndex` to zero. This variable will represent the triangular number sequence index.

3. Enter an infinite loop to continue calculating triangular numbers until a condition is met.

   a. Within the loop, calculate the triangular number corresponding to the `currentIndex`. This is done by finding the sum of all integers from 0 to `currentIndex`. Store this sum in a variable named `triangularNumber`.

   b. Calculate the difference between the `triangularNumber` and the `targetDistance`. Store this difference in a variable called `difference`.

   c. Check if the `triangularNumber` is equal to the `targetDistance`. If they are equal, this indicates an exact match, so:

      - Display the value of `currentIndex` as the result.
      - Exit the loop.

   d. If the `triangularNumber` is greater than `targetDistance`, further analyze the situation:

      - Check if the `difference` is an even number. If it is:
        
        - Display the value of `currentIndex` as the result.
        - Exit the loop.

   e. If none of the above conditions are met, increment the `currentIndex` by 1 to check the next triangular number on the next iteration of the loop.

4. The output should be the index of the first triangular number that either matches the target or satisfies the even difference condition.
