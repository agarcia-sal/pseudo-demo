Here is the pseudocode translated from the given Python code, following the structured language concepts you've outlined:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Initialize the variable
    SET n TO absolute value of integer input
    SET i TO 0

    // Step 2: Start an infinite loop to calculate triangular numbers
    WHILE true DO
        // Step 3: Calculate the triangular number for the current i
        SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) / 2
        
        // Step 4: Calculate the difference between the triangular number and n
        SET m TO s - n

        // Step 5: Check if the triangular number equals n
        IF s EQUALS n THEN
            PRINT i
            BREAK

        // Step 6: Check if the triangular number exceeds n
        ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
            // Step 7: Check if the difference is even
            IF m MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT i
                BREAK

        // Step 8: Increment i for the next iteration
        i = i + 1

END
```

### Explanations of the Components:
1. **Variables**: 
   - `n`: Stores the absolute value of the user input.
   - `i`: Used as an iterator to compute triangular numbers.
   - `s`: Represents the calculated triangular number.
   - `m`: Stores the difference between the triangular number `s` and `n`.

2. **Control Structures**:
   - **WHILE loop**: Continuously runs until a condition is met (either finding a matching triangular number or a suitable condition that leads to a match).
   - **IF statements**: Used to check conditions for finding the correct triangular number.

3. **Assumptions**: 
   - Input is provided as an integer, from which the absolute value is taken.
   - The code assumes the input will always be non-negative for meaningful triangular number calculations.

4. **Clarity and Readability**:
   - Meaningful names for variables and operations make the pseudocode easily understandable.
   - Separated actions into clear steps.

5. **Verb Tenses**:
   - Actions are stated in the present tense, indicating ongoing processes.
