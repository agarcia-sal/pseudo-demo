Here is the pseudocode that translates the provided algorithm into a clear and easily understandable format:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Read an integer input, take its absolute value
    SET inputNumber TO ABSOLUTE_VALUE(INPUT("Enter an integer: "))

    // Initialize a variable to keep track of the current index
    SET currentIndex TO 0

    // Infinite loop to iterate over possible triangular numbers
    WHILE TRUE DO

        // Calculate the sum of the first currentIndex natural numbers (triangular number)
        SET triangularNumber TO (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2

        // Determine the difference between the triangular number and the input
        SET difference TO triangularNumber - inputNumber

        // Check if we have found an exact match
        IF triangularNumber IS EQUAL TO inputNumber THEN
            PRINT currentIndex  // Output the current index
            BREAK  // Exit the loop

        // Check if the triangular number surpasses the input
        ELSE IF triangularNumber IS GREATER THAN inputNumber THEN
            // Check if the difference is an even number
            IF difference MODULO 2 IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
                PRINT currentIndex  // Output the current index
                BREAK  // Exit the loop
            END IF
        END IF

        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        currentIndex INCREMENT BY 1

    END WHILE

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by obtaining an absolute integer from the user.
- **Looping Logic**: An infinite loop continuously calculates triangular numbers while increasing the index.
- **Triangular Number Calculation**: Triangular numbers are calculated using the formula for the sum of the first 'currentIndex' integers.
- **Conditional Checks**: The process involves checking two conditions:
  1. If the triangular number equals the input.
  2. If the triangular number exceeds the input and whether the difference is even.
  
- **Output**: Once either condition is met, the current index is printed, and the loop exits.
- **Incrementing**: The index is incremented with each iteration to explore the next triangular number.

This high-level breakdown allows anyone to grasp the algorithm's flow without needing to understand the original code syntax.
