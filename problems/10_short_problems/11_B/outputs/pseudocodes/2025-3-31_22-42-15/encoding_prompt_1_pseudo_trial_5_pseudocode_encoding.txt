### Explanation:
- The algorithm starts by reading a non-negative integer input from the user.
- It then enters a loop where it calculates the sum of the first 'counter' natural numbers and checks two conditions:
  1. If the sum equals the input, it prints the counter and exits.
  2. If the sum exceeds the input, it checks if the difference is even; if it is, it prints the counter and exits.
- The counter is incremented with each iteration of the loop.
