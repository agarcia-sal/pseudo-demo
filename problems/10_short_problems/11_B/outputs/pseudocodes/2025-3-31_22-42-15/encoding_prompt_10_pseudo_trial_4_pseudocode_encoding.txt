Sure! Below is the pseudocode based on the provided code, structured for clarity and understanding.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set variable `n` to the absolute value of the integer input from the user.
   - Set variable `i` to 0.

2. **Start Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following actions indefinitely:

     a. **Calculate the Sum:**
        - Set variable `s` to the sum of the first `i` natural numbers, calculated as `(i * (i + 1)) / 2`.

     b. **Calculate the Difference:**
        - Set variable `m` to `s - n`.

     c. **Check for Match:**
        - If `s` is equal to `n`:
           - Print the value of `i`.
           - Exit the loop.

     d. **Check for Exceeding Value:**
        - If `s` is greater than `n`:
           - If `m` is divisible by 2 (i.e., `m % 2` equals 0):
              - Print the value of `i`.
              - Exit the loop.

     e. **Increment Loop Counter:**
        - Increase `i` by 1.

**Assumptions:**
- The input provided is an integer.
- The input value can be negative, hence the use of absolute value.
- The operations and comparisons are based on integer arithmetic.

This pseudocode provides a clear step-by-step representation of the logic and purpose of the original code, maintaining readability and structure.
