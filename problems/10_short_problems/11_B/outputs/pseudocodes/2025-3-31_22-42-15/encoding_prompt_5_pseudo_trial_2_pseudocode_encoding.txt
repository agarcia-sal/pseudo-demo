**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose sum of consecutive integers starting from zero either equals a given number or exceeds it by an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Get User Input**
   - Read an integer input from the user.
   - Convert the input to its absolute value and store it as "targetNumber".
   
3. **Initialize Counter**
   - Set "currentIndex" to 0.

4. **Loop Until a Condition is Met**
   - Repeat indefinitely:
     a. Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to "currentIndex" and store it as "currentSum".
     b. Calculate the difference between "currentSum" and "targetNumber" and store it as "difference".

     c. **Check Conditions**
        - If "currentSum" is equal to "targetNumber":
          - Print "currentIndex" (this is the answer).
          - End the program.
        
        - If "currentSum" is greater than "targetNumber":
          - Check if "difference" is even:
            - If it is even, print "currentIndex" (this is also an answer).
            - End the program.
    
     d. Increment "currentIndex" by 1.

5. **End Program**

**Comments Explained:**
- The program calculates the sum of consecutive numbers (0, 1, 2, ...) until either matching the target number or exceeding it while checking if the excess is even.
- The process relies on keeping track of the current index and evaluating sums in a loop until a condition is met for either matching or conditions of evenness.

By breaking down the code in this manner, we ensure each step is easy to follow and gives a clear picture of what the program does without using specific programming syntax.
