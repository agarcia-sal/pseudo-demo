Hereâ€™s the high-level pseudocode that translates the original code while following the provided guidelines:

```
FUNCTION find_integer(n)
    // Convert input to an absolute integer
    SET n TO absolute value of input

    // Initialize a counter
    SET i TO 0

    // Start an infinite loop
    WHILE TRUE DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers
        SET s TO (i * (i + 1)) / 2
        
        // Determine the difference between the sum and n
        SET m TO s - n
        
        // Check if the sum equals n
        IF s EQUALS n THEN
            // Print the current value of i and exit the loop
            PRINT i
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the sum is greater than n
        ELSE IF s GREATER THAN n THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF m MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                // Print the current value of i and exit the loop
                PRINT i
                BREAK
            
        // Increment the counter for the next iteration
        INCREMENT i BY 1

END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the pseudocode:
1. The function starts by taking an absolute integer input which represents a target value `n`.
2. A counter variable `i` is initialized to zero, which will be used to compute the sum of natural numbers.
3. The loop runs indefinitely, calculating the sum `s` of the first `i` natural numbers using the formula for the triangular number.
4. It checks if this sum equals `n`. If so, it prints the index `i` and breaks out of the loop.
5. If `s` is greater than `n`, it calculates the difference `m`. If `m` is even, it means that the excess of `s` over `n` can be evenly split; thus, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
6. Finally, if neither condition is satisfied, `i` is incremented, and the loop continues.

This structured and clear representation allows readers to grasp the code's logic and flow without needing in-depth knowledge of programming.
