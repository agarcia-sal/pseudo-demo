Here is the pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided code snippet:

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Get user input and convert to absolute integer
    SET integerValue TO absolute value of (user input as integer)

    // Step 2: Initialize a counter variable
    SET index TO 0

    // Step 3: Create an infinite loop to find a solution
    WHILE true DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
        SET sum TO (index * (index + 1)) divided by 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the calculated sum and the input value
        SET difference TO sum - integerValue
        
        // Step 4: Check if the calculated sum matches the input value
        IF sum equals integerValue THEN
            // If they are equal, print the current index and exit the loop
            PRINT index
            BREAK
        
        // Step 5: Check if the calculated sum exceeds the input value
        ELSE IF sum greater than integerValue THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference modulus 2 equals 0 THEN
                // If the difference is even, print the current index and exit the loop
                PRINT index
                BREAK
        
        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        INCREMENT index by 1
    END WHILE
END
```

### Explanation:
- The code starts by obtaining an absolute integer from the user.
- It initializes a counter called `index` to iterate over possible triangular numbers.
- An infinite loop is initiated to continuously calculate the sum of the first numbers (triangular number) and check if it meets or surpasses the input value.
- If the sum exactly equals the input, it prints the index and exits.
- If the sum exceeds the input, it checks if the difference is even and prints the index if this condition is met, before exiting.
- The index increments with each iteration of the loop to explore the next triangular number.
