Certainly! Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode translation of the provided code that captures its overall logic and operations.

```
FUNCTION findTriangleNumberPosition(inputNumber)
    // Step 1: Convert input to absolute integer
    SET absoluteValue = absolute(inputNumber)
    
    // Step 2: Initialize index variable
    SET index = 0
    
    // Step 3: Loop indefinitely
    WHILE true DO
        // Step 4: Calculate the triangular number for the current index
        SET triangularNumber = (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Step 5: Calculate the difference between the triangular number and the input number
        SET difference = triangularNumber - absoluteValue
        
        // Step 6: Check if the triangular number matches the input number
        IF triangularNumber == absoluteValue THEN
            PRINT index
            BREAK // Exit the loop if a match is found
            
        // Step 7: Check if the triangular number exceeds the input number
        ELSE IF triangularNumber > absoluteValue THEN
            // Step 8: Check if the difference is even
            IF difference MOD 2 == 0 THEN
                PRINT index
                BREAK // Exit the loop if the conditions are satisfied
            END IF
        END IF
        
        // Step 9: Increment index for the next iteration
        index = index + 1
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling:** The function starts by converting the user input to its absolute integer value.
2. **Looping:** An infinite loop is initiated, which will iterate over increasing indices to calculate triangular numbers.
3. **Triangular Number Calculation:** For each index, it computes the corresponding triangular number.
4. **Condition Checks:** It checks the computed triangular number against the absolute value of the input and determines if it matches or if certain conditions are met to print the index.
5. **Output:** The index is printed if the conditions are satisfied, and the loop breaks.

### Overall Purpose:
The goal of the function is to find and print the smallest index such that the triangular number calculated using that index is either equal to or exceeds the given input number while satisfying specific conditions related to their difference.
