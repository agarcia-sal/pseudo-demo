**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Input:** Read an integer value from the user and take its absolute value. Store this value in a variable called "targetNumber".

3. **Initialize:** Set a variable "index" to 0.

4. **Loop:** 
   - Begin an infinite loop.
   - Calculate the sum "currentSum" as the sum of the first "index" natural numbers. This is found using the formula: 
     - currentSum = (index multiplied by (index + 1)) divided by 2.
   
   - Calculate a difference "difference" as:
     - difference = currentSum - targetNumber.

5. **Conditions:**
   - If "currentSum" is equal to "targetNumber":
     - Print the value of "index".
     - Exit the loop.
   
   - Else if "currentSum" is greater than "targetNumber":
     - Check if "difference" is an even number:
       - If it is even, print the value of "index" and exit the loop.
   
6. **Update:**
   - Increment the "index" by 1.

7. **End of Loop**: Repeat the loop with the updated index.

8. **End**
