Here's the high-level pseudocode based on the provided Python code, which calculates and prints a value based on specific mathematical conditions:

```
FUNCTION FindIntegerBasedOnSum(inputValue)
    // Convert input to an absolute integer
    SET absoluteInput to absolute value of inputValue
    
    // Initialize an index variable
    SET index to 0

    // Continuously loop to find a solution
    WHILE TRUE DO
        
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers
        SET sum to (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and the absolute input
        SET difference to sum - absoluteInput
        
        // Check if the sum is equal to the absolute input
        IF sum is equal to absoluteInput THEN
            PRINT index
            BREAK  // Exit the loop since we have found our answer
            
        // Check if the sum is greater than the absolute input
        ELSE IF sum is greater than absoluteInput THEN
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference is even THEN
                PRINT index
                BREAK  // Exit the loop since we have found our answer
        
        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        INCREMENT index by 1
        
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode Logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single input value, which is converted to its absolute integer form.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The loop calculates the sum of the first `index` integers using the formula \( \text{sum} = \frac{i(i + 1)}{2} \).
3. **Conditional Checks**:
   - The first condition checks if the calculated sum matches the absolute input.
   - If the sum exceeds the absolute input, it checks if the difference between the two is even, which is significant for potentially valid outcomes.
4. **Incrementing Logic**: If none of the conditions are met, the index is incremented, and the loop continues, indefinitely checking new sums until a solution is found. 

This structured approach allows for easy understanding of the logic without delving into low-level code specifics.
