Hereâ€™s a structured pseudocode representation of the provided code, capturing its logic and operations clearly:

```
FUNCTION findMinimumInteger(n)
    // Ensure n is a non-negative integer
    n = absolute value of integer input

    // Initialize counter variable
    Initialize integer i to 0

    // Start an infinite loop
    WHILE True DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first i integers
        s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between sum s and n
        m = s - n
        
        // Check if sum s is equal to n
        IF s equals n THEN
            PRINT i  // Output the current value of i
            BREAK   // Exit the loop
            
        // Check if sum s exceeds n
        ELSE IF s is greater than n THEN
            // Check if the difference m is even
            IF m is even THEN
                PRINT i  // Output the current value of i
                BREAK   // Exit the loop
                
        // Increment counter for the next iteration
        i = i + 1
    END WHILE

END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Code Logic:
1. **Function Purpose:** The function `findMinimumInteger` determines the smallest non-negative integer `i` such that either the sum of the first `i` integers equals `n` or the difference between that sum and `n` is an even number.
2. **Loop Construction:** It continuously calculates the sum of the first `i` integers until it finds a satisfying condition, breaking out of the loop when it does.
3. **Input Handling:** The input is taken as an integer, ensuring it is non-negative with the absolute value function.
4. **Control Flow:** The pseudocode clearly outlines the conditions under which results are printed and the loop is exited. 

This pseudocode is designed to help readers understand the underlying logic without requiring them to decipher the specific programming syntax used in the original code.
