Here's the pseudocode that captures the essence of the provided code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Get the absolute value of the integer input from the user
    SET absoluteValue TO absolute value of user input
    
    // Initialize a counter for triangular numbers
    SET index TO 0

    // Infinite loop to calculate triangular numbers
    WHILE TRUE DO

        // Calculate the triangular number for the current index
        SET triangularNumber TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the triangular number and the user input
        SET difference TO triangularNumber - absoluteValue
        
        // Check if the triangular number equals the user input
        IF triangularNumber EQUALS absoluteValue THEN
            // If they are equal, print the current index
            PRINT index
            // Exit the loop
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the triangular number exceeds the user input
        ELSE IF triangularNumber GREATER THAN absoluteValue THEN
            // If the difference is even
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                // Print the current index
                PRINT index
                // Exit the loop
                BREAK
        
        // Increment the index to check the next triangular number
        INCREMENT index BY 1

END
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode starts by explaining the purpose of taking input from the user and converting it into an absolute value.
- A variable `index` is initialized to start counting triangular numbers.
- An infinite loop is used to calculate triangular numbers based on the current index.
- Conditions check if the triangular number equals the absolute input or if it exceeds it with further conditions to check if the difference is even.
- Clear actions (like printing the index and breaking the loop) are taken based on these conditions, maintaining clarity throughout.
