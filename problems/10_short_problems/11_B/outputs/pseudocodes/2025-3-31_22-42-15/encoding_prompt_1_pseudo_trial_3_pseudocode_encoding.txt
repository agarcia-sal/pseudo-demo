**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read an integer from user input.
   - Store its absolute value in a variable called `targetValue`.

3. **Initialize Counter:**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0.

4. **Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:
   
     a. **Calculate Triangle Number:**
        - Compute the triangular number `triangularNumber` as the sum of integers from 0 to `index`. 
        - This can be done using the formula: `triangularNumber = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`.
       
     b. **Calculate Difference:**
        - Determine the difference `difference` by subtracting `targetValue` from `triangularNumber`.
        
     c. **Check Conditions:**
        - If `triangularNumber` is equal to `targetValue`:
          - Print `index` as the result.
          - Exit the loop.
        
        - Else if `triangularNumber` is greater than `targetValue`:
          - If `difference` is even:
            - Print `index` as the result.
            - Exit the loop.
        
     d. **Increment Counter:**
        - Increase `index` by 1.

5. **End** 

**Output:** The program outputs the value of `index` when a specific condition based on the triangular number and the target value is met.
