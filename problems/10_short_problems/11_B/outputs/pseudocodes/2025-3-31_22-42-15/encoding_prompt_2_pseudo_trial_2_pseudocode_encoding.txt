**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start** 
2. **Input**: Read an integer value from the user and store its absolute value as `targetSum`.
3. **Initialize**: Set a counter `index` to 0.
4. **Loop**: Begin an infinite loop that continues until a break condition is met:
   - **Calculate**: Compute the sum of the first `index` natural numbers and store it as `currentSum` using the formula: currentSum = index * (index + 1) / 2.
   - **Calculate Difference**: Determine the difference between `currentSum` and `targetSum`, and store it as `difference`.
   - **Check for Exact Match**: 
     - If `currentSum` is equal to `targetSum`, then:
       - **Output**: Print the value of `index`.
       - **Terminate Loop**: Exit the loop.
   - **Check for Overshoot**: 
     - If `currentSum` is greater than `targetSum`, then:
       - **Check Parity**: If the `difference` is even:
         - **Output**: Print the value of `index`.
         - **Terminate Loop**: Exit the loop.
   - **Increment**: Increase the value of `index` by 1.
5. **End** 

This structure describes how the code evaluates whether the sum of the first series of natural numbers matches a specified target, and either prints the index of that sum or the index that results in an even difference.
