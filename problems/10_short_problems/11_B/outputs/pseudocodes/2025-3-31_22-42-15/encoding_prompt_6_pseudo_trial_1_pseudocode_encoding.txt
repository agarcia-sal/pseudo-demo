Here's a clear and understandable pseudocode representation of the provided algorithm:

```
FUNCTION FindIntegerSolution
    // Step 1: Read an integer input and take the absolute value of it
    SET targetValue TO absolute value of integer input
    
    // Step 2: Initialize a counter variable
    SET index TO 0
    
    // Step 3: Enter an infinite loop to find the solution
    WHILE True DO
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers
        SET sum TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the sum and the target value
        SET difference TO sum - targetValue
        
        // Step 4: Check if the sum equals the target value
        IF sum EQUALS targetValue THEN
            PRINT index
            BREAK FROM the loop
        
        // Check if the sum exceeds the target value
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN targetValue THEN
            // If the difference is even, we found a valid solution
            IF difference MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                PRINT index
                BREAK FROM the loop
        
        // Increment the index for the next iteration
        INCREMENT index BY 1
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Declaration**: We define a function `FindIntegerSolution` that contains the main logic of the algorithm.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and converted to its absolute value to ensure we work with a non-negative integer.

3. **Initialization**: A counter variable `index` starts at 0. This variable keeps track of the current integer we are checking.

4. **Infinite Loop**: The `while True` loop continues indefinitely until a solution is found.

5. **Sum Calculation**: For each `index`, we calculate the sum of the first `index` integers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

6. **Difference Calculation**: We compute how much larger or smaller the `sum` is than the given `targetValue`.

7. **Conditional Checks**:
   - First, check if the `sum` equals the `targetValue`. If it does, print the index and exit the loop.
   - If `sum` is greater than `targetValue`, we check if the `difference` is even. If it is, print the index and exit the loop.

8. **Increment**: If neither condition is met, we increment the index to check the next integer.

This pseudocode clearly communicates the algorithm's intent and logic, making it accessible to anyone reading it.
