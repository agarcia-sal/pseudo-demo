**Purpose:** The code calculates and prints a specific integer value based on a user's input, where the calculation is determined by a series of mathematical operations related to triangular numbers.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

  // Step 1: Get user input and ensure it is a non-negative integer
  userInput = GET absolute value of integer from user
  set counter = 0

  // Step 2: Start an infinite loop to iterate through possible values
  WHILE true DO
    
    // Step 3: Calculate the current triangular number
    currentTriangularNumber = (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2
    
    // Step 4: Determine the difference between the triangular number and user input
    difference = currentTriangularNumber - userInput
    
    // Step 5: Check conditions to decide what to do next
    IF currentTriangularNumber IS EQUAL TO userInput THEN
        // If the triangular number equals user input, print the counter and stop
        PRINT counter
        BREAK
    
    ELSE IF currentTriangularNumber IS GREATER THAN userInput THEN
        // If the triangular number exceeds user input, check if difference is even
        IF difference MOD 2 IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
            // If the difference is even, print the counter and stop
            PRINT counter
            BREAK

    // Step 6: Increment the counter for the next iteration
    INCREMENT counter by 1

END
```

**Explanation:**
- The program begins by receiving an absolute integer input from a user and initializes a counter to zero.
- It enters a loop where it calculates triangular numbers based on the counter.
- For each triangular number calculated, it checks two conditions:
  1. If it equals the user input.
  2. If it exceeds the user input and whether the difference is even.
- If either of these conditions is satisfied, it prints the counter and exits the loop.
- The counter is incremented on each iteration for the next triangular number calculation. 

This breaks down the original codes into simpler, more conceptual steps without the use of specific programming syntax, making it accessible for a broader audience.
