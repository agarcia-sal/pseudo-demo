Here’s the pseudocode that reflects the provided Python code, following the specified guided steps:

**Pseudocode:**

```
1. START

2. DECLARE integer variable n
3. SET n = absolute value of integer input
4. DECLARE integer variable i and initialize it to 0

5. WHILE true DO
    6. SET variable s to (i * (i + 1)) / 2  // Calculate the sum of the first i natural numbers
    7. SET variable m to s - n               // Calculate the difference between s and n

    8. IF s equals n THEN
        9. PRINT i                            // Output the value of i if the sum equals n
        10. BREAK                            // Exit the loop
    
    11. ELSE IF s is greater than n THEN
        12. IF m is even THEN
            13. PRINT i                      // Output the value of i if m is even
            14. BREAK                        // Exit the loop
    
    15. INCREMENT i by 1                      // Move to the next integer

16. END WHILE

17. END
```

### Assumptions:
- The input is a valid integer.
- The `abs` function is understood to convert negative inputs into positive integers.
- The `/` operator indicates floating-point division, and since we are calculating sums, it effectively results in an integer division in this context.

### Key Components:
- **Variables**: `n` (target value), `i` (iterative counter), `s` (sum of numbers), and `m` (difference).
- **Loop**: A while loop that keeps iterating until a condition is met.
- **Conditionals**: Nested if-else statements that determine the logic flow based on calculated values.

This structure illustrates the intended functionality of the original code without reliance on programming-specific syntax or jargon, ensuring it’s easily interpretable as logical steps.
