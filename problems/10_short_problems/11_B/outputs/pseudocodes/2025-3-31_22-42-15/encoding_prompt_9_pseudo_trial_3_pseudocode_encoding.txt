### Purpose
The goal of this algorithm is to find the smallest non-negative integer (i) such that the sum of the first i integers either equals or can be adjusted to equal a given non-negative integer (n) by removing an even integer from that sum.

### Pseudocode

1. **Get Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter a non-negative integer and store its absolute value as `targetSum`.

2. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set `currentIndex` to 0.

3. **Loop for Calculation:**
   - Repeat indefinitely:
     - Calculate the sum of the first `currentIndex` integers and store it in `currentSum`:
       - `currentSum = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2`
     - Calculate the difference between `currentSum` and `targetSum`, storing this as `difference`:
       - `difference = currentSum - targetSum`
     
     - **Check Conditions:**
       - If `currentSum` is equal to `targetSum`:
         - Print `currentIndex`
         - Stop the process.
       - If `currentSum` is greater than `targetSum`:
         - If the difference is even:
           - Print `currentIndex`
           - Stop the process.

     - Increment `currentIndex` by 1.

### Input and Output Description
- **Input:** A non-negative integer provided by the user.
- **Output:** The smallest non-negative integer (i) that satisfies the conditions described.

### Simplified Steps
- Take input and ignore its sign.
- Use a loop to compute the sum of integers starting from 0.
- Compare this sum with the input.
- Check if the difference from the input is even when the sum exceeds the input.
- Print the integer index when a condition meets and exit the loop.

By following these steps, this pseudocode effectively mirrors the logic of the original code while ensuring clarity and readability for a broader audience.
