**Pseudocode for Finding the Triangular Number**

1. **Input**: Get an integer from the user and convert it to its absolute value.
   - Set `number` to the absolute value of user input.

2. **Initialize**: Start a counter variable.
   - Set `index` to 0.

3. **Loop indefinitely**: Continue checking for conditions related to triangular numbers.
   - Repeat the following steps:
   
   a. **Calculate Triangular Number**: Use the formula for the sum of the first `index` numbers.
      - Set `triangularSum` to the value of (index * (index + 1)) / 2.
   
   b. **Calculate Difference**: Determine how far the triangular number is from the input number.
      - Set `difference` to `triangularSum - number`.
   
   c. **Check Conditions**:
      - If `triangularSum` equals `number`:
        - Print `index` (this indicates that `number` is a triangular number), then exit the loop.
      - Else if `triangularSum` is greater than `number`:
        - If `difference` is even:
          - Print `index` (this indicates that `number` can be represented as a triangular number with an adjustment), then exit the loop.

   d. **Increment Counter**: After each iteration, increase `index` by 1.

4. **End of Pseudocode**: The loop will exit when a print statement has executed, indicating the successful identification of the triangular number condition.
