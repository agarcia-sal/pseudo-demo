**Purpose:** The program aims to find the least non-negative integer whose triangular number is equal to or exceeds a given positive integer, and if the difference is even, it outputs that integer.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set `absoluteValue` to the absolute value of the input number (convert input to an integer).
   - Set `index` to 0 (this will be used to calculate triangular numbers).

2. **Start an Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:
     
     1. **Calculate Triangular Number:**
        - Set `triangularNumber` to the sum of all integers from 0 to `index` (this can be calculated using the formula: `triangularNumber = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`).
        
     2. **Calculate Difference:**
        - Set `difference` to the result of subtracting `absoluteValue` from `triangularNumber`.
        
     3. **Check for Equality:**
        - If `triangularNumber` is equal to `absoluteValue`:
          - Output `index`.
          - Exit the loop.
          
     4. **Check for Greater Value:**
        - If `triangularNumber` is greater than `absoluteValue`:
          - If `difference` is even (when `difference` modulo 2 equals 0):
            - Output `index`.
            - Exit the loop.
          
     5. **Increment Index:**
        - Increase `index` by 1.

**Input:** The program takes an integer input and calculates its absolute value.
**Output:** The program outputs the smallest non-negative integer that meets the specified conditions based on the triangular number calculation.
