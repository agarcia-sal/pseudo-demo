**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start** by getting a number from the user.
   - Convert the input to an integer.
   - Get the absolute value of this integer and store it as `targetNumber`.

2. **Initialize a counter variable** `index` to 0.

3. **Enter an infinite loop** that will keep executing until a break statement is encountered:
   - Calculate the sum of the first `index` natural numbers, which is given by the formula `sumOfFirstIndex = (index * (index + 1)) divided by 2`.
   - Calculate `difference` as the result of subtracting `targetNumber` from `sumOfFirstIndex`.

4. **Check if the current sum equals the target number**:
   - If `sumOfFirstIndex` is equal to `targetNumber`, print the value of `index` and exit the loop.

5. **Check if the current sum exceeds the target number**:
   - If `sumOfFirstIndex` is greater than `targetNumber`, check if `difference` is an even number.
     - If `difference` is even, print the value of `index` and exit the loop.

6. **Increment the counter variable** `index` by 1 and repeat the loop.

7. **End** when the loop is exited via a break statement.
