Below is the pseudocode representing the logic of the provided code snippet. It captures the intent and flow clearly without getting bogged down in specific programming syntax.

```
START

// Step 1: Get user input
SET inputNumber TO absolute value of integer(input from user)

// Step 2: Initialize loop variable
SET index TO 0

// Step 3: Begin an infinite loop to find the solution
WHILE true DO
    // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
    SET sum TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
    
    // Calculate the difference between the sum and inputNumber
    SET difference TO sum - inputNumber

    // Step 4: Check if the current sum equals the input number
    IF sum EQUALS inputNumber THEN
        PRINT index
        BREAK from loop

    // Step 5: Check if the current sum exceeds the input number
    ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN inputNumber THEN
        // Check if the difference is even
        IF difference MOD 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
            PRINT index
            BREAK from loop
        END IF
    END IF

    // Increment the loop variable
    SET index TO index + 1
END WHILE

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Input Handling:** The algorithm starts by reading a user input, converting it to an integer, and ensuring it is positive.
- **Loop Structure:** It uses an infinite loop to continuously calculate the sum of natural numbers up to the current `index`, along with checking necessary conditions to find the required index.
- **Conditional Logic:** The pseudocode checks specific conditions to determine if it has found the correct index to satisfy the problem's requirements. If found, it prints the index and breaks out of the loop.
- **Clarity and Readability:** The use of descriptive names and structured representation aims to make the flow and purpose of the code accessible to readers unfamiliar with the original programming logic.
