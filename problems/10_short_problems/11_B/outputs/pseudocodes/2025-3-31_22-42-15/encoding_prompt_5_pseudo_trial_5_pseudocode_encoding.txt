### Purpose Summary:
The goal of the code is to determine the smallest non-negative integer that meets a specific condition related to triangular numbers and a given input number.

### Pseudocode:

```
START

// Get the absolute value of the input and store it as a number
number = ABSOLUTE_VALUE(STRING_TO_INTEGER(INPUT("Enter a number: ")))

// Initialize a counter variable
counter = 0

// Enter an infinite loop to repeatedly check conditions
WHILE TRUE DO
    // Calculate the triangular number for the current counter value
    triangularNumber = (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2

    // Calculate the difference between the triangular number and the input number
    difference = triangularNumber - number

    // Check if the triangular number is equal to the input number
    IF triangularNumber IS EQUAL TO number THEN
        // Print the current counter as the result
        PRINT("The result is:", counter)
        // Exit the loop since the condition is satisfied
        BREAK

    // Check if the triangular number is greater than the input number
    ELSE IF triangularNumber IS GREATER THAN number THEN
        // Check if the difference is an even number
        IF difference MODULUS 2 IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
            // Print the current counter as the result since the condition is met
            PRINT("The result is:", counter)
            // Exit the loop since the condition is satisfied
            BREAK

    // Increment the counter for the next iteration
    counter = counter + 1

END
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** The user is prompted to enter a number, which is then converted into an integer and its absolute value is taken.
  
2. **Loop Logic:** The program continuously checks whether the triangular number derived from the current counter matches the original number or exceeds it in a way that allows the program to qualify the condition based on the evenness of the difference.

3. **Output Statement:** When either condition is satisfied, the current counter is printed as the result.

4. **Incrementing Counter:** After each check, the counter is incremented to explore the next triangular number.

This structure is straightforward and emphasizes the logic behind the code clearly, making it accessible to readers without a programming background.
