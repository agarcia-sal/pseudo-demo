### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling:** It begins by accepting a user input and converting it into an absolute integer, which is stored as `targetSum`.
2. **Initialization:** A counter `index` is initialized to zero to keep track of the current number being evaluated.
3. **Loop Structure:** A `WHILE true` loop runs indefinitely until a break condition is met.
4. **Sum Calculation:** Inside the loop, the sum of the first `index` natural numbers is calculated.
5. **Condition Checks:** Several conditions check if the current sum matches or exceeds the target sum.
6. **Output and Break:** If conditions are satisfied, the current index is printed, and the loop ends.
7. **Incrementing Index:** If conditions are not met, the index is incremented for the next iteration, leading to the evaluation of the next natural number.
