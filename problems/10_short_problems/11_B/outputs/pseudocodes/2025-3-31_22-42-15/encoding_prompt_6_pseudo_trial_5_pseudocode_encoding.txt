Here is a clear and understandable pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided code:

```
BEGIN

    // Read an integer input and convert it to its absolute value
    SET inputNumber TO absolute value of integer(input())

    // Initialize a variable to keep track of the current index
    SET currentIndex TO 0

    // Infinite loop to evaluate conditions
    WHILE true DO
        
        // Calculate the sum of the first 'currentIndex' natural numbers
        SET sum TO (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2
        
        // Calculate the difference between the 'sum' and the input number
        SET difference TO sum - inputNumber
        
        // Check if the calculated sum equals the input number
        IF sum equals inputNumber THEN
            // If true, print the current index and exit the loop
            PRINT currentIndex
            BREAK
        
        // Check if the calculated sum exceeds the input number
        ELSE IF sum greater than inputNumber THEN
            
            // Check if the difference is even
            IF difference is an even number THEN
                // If true, print the current index and exit the loop
                PRINT currentIndex
                BREAK
        
        // Increment the current index for the next iteration
        INCREMENT currentIndex by 1

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading an integer input and taking its absolute value.
2. **Initialization**: A variable to track the current index is initialized to zero.
3. **Loop Structure**: A while loop continuously evaluates conditions based on the calculated sum.
4. **Calculations**: Within the loop, the sum of the first `currentIndex` natural numbers and the difference from the input number are calculated.
5. **Conditional Checks**: The code checks:
   - If the sum equals the input number, it prints the index.
   - If the sum exceeds the input number, it checks if the difference is even before printing the index.
6. **Index Increment**: The index is increased in each iteration of the loop until one of the conditions is met.

This pseudocode breaks down the original code's logic in a structured way that is easy to follow.
