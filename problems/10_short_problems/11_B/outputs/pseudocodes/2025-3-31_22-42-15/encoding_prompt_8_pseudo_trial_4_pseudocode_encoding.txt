**Purpose**: The code aims to find and print the smallest integer, `i`, such that the sum of the first `i` integers is equal to or exceeds a given positive integer `n`. Additionally, it checks if the difference between this sum and `n` is even before printing the result.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Get Input**:
   - Read a number from the user and store its absolute value in a variable called 'targetNumber'.

2. **Initialize Counter**:
   - Set a variable 'counter' to 0 to keep track of the current integer.

3. **Start Infinite Loop**:
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely:

    a. **Calculate Sum**:
       - Calculate the sum of the first 'counter' integers and store it in a variable called 'currentSum'.
       - The formula for this is: `currentSum = (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2`.

    b. **Calculate Difference**:
       - Determine the difference between 'currentSum' and 'targetNumber' and store it in a variable called 'difference'.
       - This is done by: `difference = currentSum - targetNumber`.

    c. **Check for Matching Sum**:
       - If 'currentSum' equals 'targetNumber':
         - Print the value of 'counter'.
         - Exit the loop.

    d. **Check for Exceeding Sum**:
       - If 'currentSum' is greater than 'targetNumber':
         - If 'difference' is an even number:
           - Print the value of 'counter'.
           - Exit the loop.
        
    e. **Increment Counter**:
       - Increase the value of 'counter' by 1.

**Commented Notes**:
- The loop continues incrementing 'counter' and calculating the sum until the conditions to print 'counter' are satisfied.
- The check for 'difference' being even ensures that the sum matches the forms required by the problem's logic.
