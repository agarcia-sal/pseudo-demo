**Pseudocode Explanation:**

1. **Input Requirement:** 
   - Read an integer value from the user and store its absolute value in a variable called `targetSum`.

2. **Initialize a counter:** 
   - Set a variable `currentIndex` to 0 to keep track of the current index.

3. **Loop Until a Condition is Met:**
   - Begin an infinite loop that will only terminate when a valid output condition is satisfied.

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Within the loop, calculate the sum of the first `currentIndex` integers using the formula for the sum of a series, storing the result in a variable called `sumOfSeries`.

5. **Compute Difference:**
   - Determine the difference between `sumOfSeries` and `targetSum`, and store this in a variable called `difference`.

6. **Check Conditions:**
   - First, check if `sumOfSeries` is equal to `targetSum`. 
     - If it is, output the value of `currentIndex` and stop the loop.
   - If `sumOfSeries` is greater than `targetSum`, check if `difference` is even.
     - If `difference` is even, output the value of `currentIndex` and stop the loop.

7. **Increment the Counter:**
   - Increase `currentIndex` by 1 and repeat the loop.

**Output Requirement:**
- The output will be the value of `currentIndex` that fulfills one of the earlier conditions (either exactly matching `targetSum` or having an even difference when the sum exceeds `targetSum`).
