Here is the pseudocode derived from the provided code, following the guided steps:

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
2. **Declare Variables:**
   - Set variable `n` to the absolute value of the integer input
   - Set variable `i` to 0 
3. **Begin Infinite Loop:**
   - Compute the triangular number `s` as the sum of the first `i` natural numbers: 
     - `s` = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
   - Set variable `m` to `s - n`
  
   4. **Check Conditions:**
     - If `s` equals `n`:
         - Display the value of `i`
         - Exit the loop
     - Else If `s` is greater than `n`:
         - If `m` is an even number:
             - Display the value of `i`
             - Exit the loop

5. **Increment `i` by 1**
6. **Repeat from Step 3**
7. **End**

**Assumptions:**
- Input is a valid integer.
- The absolute function is understood to return the non-negative value of the input.
- The meaning of “display” refers to printing output or logging for user visibility.

This structured pseudocode clearly represents the logic without programming jargon, emphasizing readability and understanding of the flow.
