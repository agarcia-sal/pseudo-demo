**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to find the smallest non-negative integer whose triangular number matches or exceeds a given positive integer, and if it exceeds, to check if the difference is an even number.

---

**Pseudocode**:

```
1. Obtain a positive integer from the user
   - Store the absolute value of this integer in a variable called 'targetValue'

2. Initialize a variable 'currentIndex' to 0

3. Begin an infinite loop to calculate triangular numbers
   - a. Calculate the triangular number for 'currentIndex'
      - This is done by using the formula: triangularNumber = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2

   - b. Calculate the difference between the triangular number and 'targetValue'
      - Store this difference in a variable called 'difference'

   - c. Check if the triangular number equals the targetValue
      - If they are equal:
         - Print the currentIndex (this is the triangular number position)
         - Exit the loop

   - d. Check if the triangular number is greater than the targetValue
      - If it is greater:
         - Check if the difference is an even number (remainder when divided by 2 equals 0)
         - If the difference is even:
            - Print the currentIndex
            - Exit the loop

   - e. Increment 'currentIndex' by 1 to check the next triangular number
```

**Comments**:
- This code repeats the calculation of triangular numbers and checks conditions until it finds a suitable 'currentIndex'.
- A triangular number is the sum of all integers from 1 to 'currentIndex'. The formula used simplifies this calculation.
- The logic ensures that not only does the triangular number need to be equal to or exceed 'targetValue', but it also checks if the excess (the difference) is even before confirming the result.

**Example Structures**: 
- Input can be understood as a user entering a number on the screen.
- Output is the index of the triangular number that meets the specified conditions.
