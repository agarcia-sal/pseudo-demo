Here's the pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```
START

// Read an integer input from the user and take its absolute value.
SET userInput TO ABSOLUTE_VALUE(READ_INTEGER_INPUT())

// Initialize a variable to keep track of the current index.
SET index TO 0

// Continuously loop until a condition is met.
WHILE TRUE DO
    // Calculate the sum of the first 'index' integers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
    SET sum TO (index * (index + 1)) / 2
    
    // Determine the difference between the calculated sum and the user input.
    SET difference TO sum - userInput
    
    // Check if the calculated sum is equal to the user input.
    IF sum IS EQUAL TO userInput THEN
        // If they are equal, print the current index and exit the loop.
        PRINT index
        BREAK
    
    // Check if the calculated sum exceeds the user input.
    ELSE IF sum IS GREATER THAN userInput THEN
        // If the difference is even, print the current index and exit the loop.
        IF difference MODULO 2 IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
            PRINT index
            BREAK
    
    // Increment the index to check the next integer in the next iteration.
    SET index TO index + 1

END
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode starts by accepting user input and ensuring it's non-negative using the absolute value function.
- It initializes an index variable for tracking the sum of the first few integers.
- A loop is established that continues indefinitely until certain conditions are met.
- Inside the loop, it computes the sum of the first `index` integers and compares it to the user input.
- It checks if the sum is exactly equal to the user input or if it exceeds it and whether the difference is even.
- If any of the conditions are met, it prints the index and exits the loop. 
- The index is incremented in each iteration to explore further integers if the conditions are not satisfied yet.
