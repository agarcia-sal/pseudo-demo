**Pseudocode: Find the smallest non-negative integer that meets specific conditions based on a given number**

1. **Input**: 
   - Read an integer value and take its absolute value, store it in a variable named `targetValue`.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - Set a variable `index` to 0. This will be used to iteratively calculate sums.

3. **Loop**: 
   - Continuously perform the following steps until a condition is met:
   
     a. Calculate the sum `currentSum` as the sum of the first `index` integers, using the formula: 
        *currentSum = (index * (index + 1)) divided by 2*.

     b. Compute a variable `difference` by subtracting `targetValue` from `currentSum`:
        *difference = currentSum - targetValue*.

     c. Check if `currentSum` is equal to `targetValue`:
        - If they are equal, print the value of `index` and stop the loop.
        
     d. If `currentSum` is greater than `targetValue`, check if the `difference` is an even number:
        - If the `difference` is even, print the value of `index` and stop the loop.

     e. Increment `index` by 1 to evaluate the next integer in the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Output**: 
   - The output will be the smallest non-negative integer `index` that satisfies one of the conditions above.

This pseudocode summarizes the approach to find the required integer based on the input value while maintaining the overall logic and control flow of the original code.
