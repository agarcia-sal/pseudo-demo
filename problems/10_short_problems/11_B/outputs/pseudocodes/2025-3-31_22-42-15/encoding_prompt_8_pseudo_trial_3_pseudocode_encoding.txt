**Purpose**: The code aims to find a non-negative integer that either exactly equals the sum of the first 'i' integers or, if the sum exceeds a given number 'n', it checks if the difference can be evenly divided by 2 and prints 'i' when this condition is met.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start the Program**

2. **Get User Input**
   - Read an integer value from the user and store it in a variable called `targetValue`
   - Calculate the absolute value of `targetValue`

3. **Initialize Variables**
   - Set a counter variable `currentIndex` to 0

4. **Begin Infinite Loop**
   - While true:
     1. Calculate the sum of the first 'currentIndex' integers and store it in a variable `sumOfIntegers`
        - This is calculated using the formula: **sumOfIntegers = (currentIndex * (currentIndex + 1)) / 2**
     2. Calculate the difference between `sumOfIntegers` and `targetValue` and store it in a variable `difference`
        - **difference = sumOfIntegers - targetValue**
     
     3. **Check Conditions**:
        1. If `sumOfIntegers` is equal to `targetValue`:
           - Print `currentIndex` (this is the required number)
           - Exit the loop (finish the program)
        2. If `sumOfIntegers` is greater than `targetValue`:
           - If `difference` is evenly divisible by 2 (check if the remainder of difference divided by 2 is zero):
             - Print `currentIndex` (this is the required number)
             - Exit the loop (finish the program)
     
     4. Increment `currentIndex` by 1 to check the next integer in the next loop iteration

**End of Program**

**Comments**:
- The loop continues indefinitely until a condition is met to stop it.
- The purpose of calculating the sum of integers is to find a suitable value of 'i' such that the sum either matches or can be adjusted to match the targetValue through an even difference.
- The use of absolute values ensures that negative inputs do not cause issues with the calculations.
