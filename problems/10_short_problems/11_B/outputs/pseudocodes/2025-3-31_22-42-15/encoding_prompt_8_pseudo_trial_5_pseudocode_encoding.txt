**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to find a non-negative integer, denoted as 'i', such that the sum of the first 'i' natural numbers equals a given input number, 'n', or can be adjusted to equal 'n' by removing an even number.

**Pseudocode:**  

1. **Start the process**
   
2. **Get Input:**
   - Prompt the user for a number.
   - Convert the input to an absolute integer and store it in 'desired_sum'.

3. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set 'i' to 0, which will serve as a counter to track the number of terms.

4. **Loop Indefinitely:**
   - Repeat the following steps until a condition is met:
     1. Calculate the sum_of_first_i as the sum of all integers from 1 to 'i':
        - Use the formula: sum_of_first_i = (i * (i + 1)) / 2
     
     2. Determine the difference between the calculated sum and the desired sum:
        - Calculate difference = sum_of_first_i - desired_sum

     3. **Check Conditions:**
        - If sum_of_first_i equals desired_sum:
          - Print the value of 'i' (this is the answer) and exit the loop.
        
        - If sum_of_first_i is greater than desired_sum:
          - If the difference is even:
            - Print the value of 'i' (this is also a potential answer) and exit the loop.
     
     4. **Increment the Counter:**
        - Increase the value of 'i' by 1, moving to the next integer.

5. **End the process**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- This loop continues until an appropriate value for 'i' is found, either matching the desired sum or adjusting for it by disregarding an even part of the total sum.
- The calculation for the sum of the first 'i' integers uses an efficient arithmetic formula to avoid unnecessary loops.
