**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to find the smallest non-negative integer that either represents a triangular number equal to a specified input or can be adjusted by removing an even number to match the input.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Get a number from the user and convert it to its absolute integer value. Let this number be referred to as `targetNumber`.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set an integer variable `currentInteger` to 0 to keep track of the current number being evaluated.

3. **Start an Infinite Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps indefinitely until a valid number is found:

   4. **Calculate Triangular Number:**
      - Calculate the triangular number `triangularNumber` using the formula: 
        - `triangularNumber = (currentInteger * (currentInteger + 1)) / 2`
        
   5. **Determine the Difference:**
      - Calculate `difference` as:
        - `difference = triangularNumber - targetNumber`
        
   6. **Check Conditions:**
      - If `triangularNumber` is equal to `targetNumber`, then:
        - Output `currentInteger`
        - Exit the loop (valid number found).
        
      - Else, if `triangularNumber` is greater than `targetNumber`, then:
        - Check if `difference` is an even number:
          - If it is even, then:
            - Output `currentInteger`
            - Exit the loop (valid adjustment found).
            
   7. **Increment the Integer:**
      - Increase `currentInteger` by 1.

This pseudocode outlines the logic behind iterating through non-negative integers to find a suitable match based on triangular numbers and the given input, emphasizing clarity and interpretability.
