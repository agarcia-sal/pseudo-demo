**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
2. **Get input:** Read an integer value from the user and store its absolute value in a variable called `targetSum`.
3. **Initialize index:** Set a variable `index` to 0.
4. **Repeat indefinitely:** 
    a. Calculate the sum of the first `index` natural numbers using the formula: 
        - `currentSum = (index * (index + 1)) / 2`
    b. Calculate the difference between `currentSum` and `targetSum`:
        - `difference = currentSum - targetSum`
    c. **Check if currentSum equals targetSum:**
        - If they are equal, then:
            - Print the current value of `index`
            - Exit the loop
    d. **Check if currentSum is greater than targetSum:**
        - If it is greater:
            - Check if the difference is an even number:
                - If the difference is even, then:
                    - Print the current value of `index`
                    - Exit the loop
    e. **Increment index:** Increase the value of `index` by 1.
5. **End**
