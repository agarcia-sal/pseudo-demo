### Pseudocode

1. **Set Variables:**
   Initialize `n` to the absolute value of the integer input.
   Initialize `i` to 0.

2. **Start Infinite Loop:**
   Repeat until a break condition is met:
   
   a. **Calculate Sum:**
      Set `s` to the sum of the first `i` natural numbers using the formula `s = (i * (i + 1)) / 2`.

   b. **Calculate Difference:**
      Set `m` to the difference between `s` and `n`, `m = s - n`.

   c. **Check Conditions:**
      - If `s` equals `n`, then:
         - Print the value of `i`.
         - Exit the loop.
         
      - Else If `s` is greater than `n`, then:
         - If `m` is even, then:
            - Print the value of `i`.
            - Exit the loop.
            
   d. **Increment Counter:**
      Increase `i` by 1.

### Assumptions: 
- The input received is an integer value.
- The calculation of the absolute value is valid (i.e., numeric).
- The loop will eventually terminate as `i` continues to increase.

### Example Execution:
- This pseudocode will find and print the smallest integer index `i` such that the sum of the first `i` natural numbers either equals or exceeds `n` in a way that their difference is even.
