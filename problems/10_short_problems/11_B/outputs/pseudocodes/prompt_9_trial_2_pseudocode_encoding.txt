**Purpose:**  
The algorithm aims to find an integer value based on a calculation involving the sum of the first 'i' natural numbers and a given input number. It identifies when the cumulative sum either matches or exceeds the input number.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **START**
2. **DECLARE** inputNumber as an integer
3. **READ** inputNumber from the user and convert it to absolute value
4. **INITIALIZE** index as 0  // This variable will track the current natural number
5. **REPEAT FOREVER**:
   a. **CALCULATE** sum as (index * (index + 1)) divided by 2  // This represents the sum of the first 'index' natural numbers
   b. **SET** difference as sum minus inputNumber
   c. **IF** sum is equal to inputNumber THEN:
      i. **PRINT** index  // The index represents the solution where the sum equals the input number
      ii. **EXIT** the loop
   d. **ELSE IF** sum is greater than inputNumber THEN:
      i. **IF** difference is even THEN:
         - **PRINT** index  // The index is a solution if the difference is an even number
         - **EXIT** the loop
   e. **INCREMENT** index by 1  // Move to the next natural number
6. **END**
