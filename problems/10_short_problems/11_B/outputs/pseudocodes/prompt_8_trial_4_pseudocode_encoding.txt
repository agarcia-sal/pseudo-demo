**Purpose:** The objective of this code is to find and print a specific integer (denoted as `i`) such that the sum of the first `i` integers equals a given non-negative integer `n` or is greater than `n` by an even number.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Prompt the user to enter a number and take the absolute value of it
    INPUT number
    SET absoluteNumber = absolute value of number

    // Step 2: Initialize a counter to zero
    SET counter = 0

    // Step 3: Enter an indefinite loop to calculate the sum
    WHILE TRUE DO

        // Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first 'counter' integers
        SET sum = (counter * (counter + 1)) / 2
        
        // Step 5: Calculate the difference between the sum and 'absoluteNumber'
        SET difference = sum - absoluteNumber
        
        // Step 6: Check if the sum equals the absolute number
        IF sum EQUALS absoluteNumber THEN
            // If they are equal, print the current counter
            PRINT counter
            BREAK     // Exit the loop
            
        // Step 7: Check if the sum is greater than the absolute number
        ELSE IF sum GREATER THAN absoluteNumber THEN
            // Check if the difference is an even number
            IF difference MODULO 2 EQUALS 0 THEN
                // If the difference is even, print the current counter
                PRINT counter
                BREAK     // Exit the loop
                
        // Step 8: Increment the counter for the next iteration
        INCREMENT counter by 1

END
```

**Comments:**
- The program uses a loop to continuously calculate the sum of integers from `0` up to `i` (represented as `counter`).
- It breaks out of the loop and prints `i` when it finds that either the sum equals the input number or exceeds it by an even difference.
- The conditions are straightforward and allow for efficient finding of the integer `i`.
