**Purpose:** The primary goal of the code is to find the largest integer **i** such that the sum of the first **i** natural numbers is equal to or exceeds a given positive number **n**, under specific conditions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
1. Get the absolute value of a user input and store it in a variable named 'targetNumber'.
2. Initialize a variable 'currentIndex' to 0.

3. Start an infinite loop:
    a. Calculate the sum of the first 'currentIndex' natural numbers and store it in a variable 'currentSum'.
    b. Calculate the difference 'remainder' as 'currentSum' minus 'targetNumber'.

4. Check if 'currentSum' is equal to 'targetNumber':
    - If yes, print 'currentIndex' (this is the answer) and exit the loop.

5. Check if 'currentSum' is greater than 'targetNumber':
    - If yes, check if 'remainder' is an even number:
        * If the remainder is even, print 'currentIndex' (this is a valid solution) and exit the loop.

6. Increment 'currentIndex' by 1 and repeat the process from step 3.
```

**Explanation of Key Sections:**

- **Input Handling:** We take a user input, convert it to an absolute integer to ensure it's positive, and store it as 'targetNumber'.
  
- **Sum Calculation:** The sum of numbers is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first **i** natural numbers. This here expands the meaning of `s = (i*(i + 1))//2`.

- **Conditions:** The logic checks:
  - If the calculated sum equals the target.
  - If the sum exceeds the target, it checks if the difference (remainder) is even, which helps decide if 'i' can still be considered within the logic set by the original code.

- **Loop Control:** The process continues until a solution is found, with 'currentIndex' increasing each time to explore higher sums.

This pseudocode is designed to clearly outline the operations without any programming-specific syntax, making it accessible to those unfamiliar with coding while providing a systematic approach to understanding the logic behind the original code.
