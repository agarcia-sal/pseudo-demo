**Purpose**: This program reads a file path from standard input, normalizes the path by removing any unnecessary components, and ensures that the result starts with a single forward slash.

**Pseudocode**:

```
START

// Step 1: Read input from standard input (simulating file path input)
INPUT rawFilePath FROM standard input

// Step 2: Normalize the file path
// This process cleans up the path by removing redundant elements
normalizedFilePath = normalizePath(rawFilePath)

// Step 3: Ensure the path starts with a single forward slash
IF normalizedFilePath starts with one or more slashes THEN
    resultFilePath = removeExtraLeadingSlashes(normalizedFilePath)
ELSE
    resultFilePath = normalizedFilePath // If there are no leading slashes, keep it as is
END IF

// Step 4: Print the final result
OUTPUT resultFilePath

// Function that normalizes the file path using a suitable method
FUNCTION normalizePath(filePath)
    // Implementation that handles path normalization
    RETURN normalizedPath

// Function that removes extra leading slashes from the path
FUNCTION removeExtraLeadingSlashes(filePath)
    // Implementation that ensures the path starts with a single slash
    RETURN modifiedPath

END
```

**Notes**:
1. The `normalizePath` function represents the operation of cleaning up the file path, which might involve removing unnecessary elements like dots or double slashes.
2. The `removeExtraLeadingSlashes` function ensures the final path begins with exactly one slash, regardless of the input.
3. The flow involves reading input, processing it, and then outputting the desired format, emphasizing clarity in each step of the program's logic.
