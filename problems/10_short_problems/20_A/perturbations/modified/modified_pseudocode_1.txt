**Purpose:**  
The goal of the code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it by removing redundant path separators, and then output the cleaned-up path.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:  
   - Use a library to handle file path operations.  
   - Use a library that allows processing of regular expressions.

2. **Read Input**:  
   - Retrieve the entire input from the user or a file.
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.

3. **Normalize the Path**:  
   - Transform the input path to ensure it follows a standard format by removing unnecessary path separators (like multiple slashes) between directories.

4. **Adjust Leading Slashes**:  
   - Change the path so that if it starts with one or more slashes, it should only have a single leading slash. 

5. **Output the Result**:  
   - Print the final, cleaned-up path for the user.

**Detailed Steps:**

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Step 1: Import libraries for path manipulation and regex processing
    IMPORT posixpath
    IMPORT sys
    IMPORT re

    // Step 2: Read input path
    INPUT_PATH = READ input from user (standard input)
    STRIPPED_PATH = REMOVE leading and trailing whitespace from INPUT_PATH

    // Step 3: Normalize the path
    NORMALIZED_PATH = CALL posixpath.normpath with STRIPPED_PATH

    // Step 4: Adjust leading slashes
    CLEANED_PATH = REPLACE all leading slashes in NORMALIZED_PATH with a single slash

    // Step 5: Output the cleaned-up path
    PRINT CLEANED_PATH

END PROGRAM
```

**Comments for Clarity:**  
- The library `posixpath` is used to help clean up the path which allows for proper handling of path strings.
- The `re.sub` function is utilized to simplify any leading slashes in the final output, ensuring only a single slash remains at the start if the path is absolute.
- This pseudocode is designed to be clearly understandable without needing prior programming knowledge, focusing on logic and sequence rather than syntax.
