**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to read a file path input from the user, normalize that path to ensure it has a standard format, and then print the path with any leading slashes removed except for one.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program**

2. **Define a Function to Normalize File Paths**
   - Input: A string representing the file path
   - Output: A normalized version of the input path

3. **Read Input**
   - Read the file path from the standard input (user input or a file)
   - Remove any extra spaces from the beginning and end of the input

4. **Normalize the File Path**
   - Change the file path to a standard format by:
     - Replacing any backslashes with forward slashes
     - Eliminating redundant slashes within the path
   
5. **Adjust Leading Slashes**
   - If the normalized path starts with more than one slash, replace it with a single leading slash

6. **Display the Normalized Path**
   - Print the formatted path to the output

7. **End the Program**

**Detailed Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Input Handling**
   - Read the entire input from the user. This could be a path like "////home/user///documents/"
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input

2. **Normalization Process**
   - Convert multiple consecutive slashes (like '///') into a single slash ('/')
   - Ensure that if the path starts with slashes, it only retains the first one.

3. **Output**
   - Print the final version of the file path which should have one leading slash and normalized slashes throughout.

**Example:**
- If the input is "//home//user//documents//", the output will be "/home/user/documents/". 

**Notes:**
- Ensure that the transformation processes of both normalization and leading slash adjustment are clear and distinct.
- This pseudocode captures the logic without getting into technical programming syntax, making it accessible for readers without a programming background.
