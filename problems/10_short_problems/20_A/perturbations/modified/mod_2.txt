**Pseudocode**

1. **Start Program**

   - Read a sequence of characters from standard input, which is expected to represent a file path.
   - Remove any leading or trailing spaces from the input.

   - Adjust the file path to eliminate redundant slashes and normalize the structure according to standard file path formatting rules.

   - If the normalized path begins with one or more slashes, replace those leading slashes with a single slash.
   - This ensures that the path starts with a single slash, regardless of how many slashes were originally at the start.

   - Display the modified file path.

6. **End Program**
