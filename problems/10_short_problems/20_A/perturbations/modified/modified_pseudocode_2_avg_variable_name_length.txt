**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to normalize a given file path input by removing extra slashes at the beginning and ensuring the format is correct for computational processing.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Read Input**:
   - Get the entire input from the standard input stream.
   - Remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the input.

2. **Normalize the Path**:
   - Convert the input path to a standard format that follows the rules for file paths, eliminating any unnecessary components.

3. **Remove Leading Slashes**:
   - If the normalized path starts with multiple slashes, ensure only a single leading slash is retained.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Display the final normalized path.

**Detailed Steps**:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read the user input
    SET us = READ input from the standard input stream
    TRIM any leading and trailing whitespace from us

    // Step 2: Normalize the path
    SET nor = NORMALIZE the us path

    // Step 3: Remove extra leading slashes
    IF nor starts with one or more slashes THEN
        SET nor = REPLACE multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    END IF

    // Step 4: Output the final result
    PRINT nor

END
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The function `READ` captures input from the user or another source.
- `TRIM` removes spaces from the beginning and end of the string.
- `NORMALIZE` ensures the path format is standardized according to file system rules (like converting backslashes to slashes).
- `REPLACE` is used to handle the leading slashes, making sure only one is present.

This pseudocode structure helps encapsulate the logic without diving into programming specifics, making it easier to follow for readers unfamiliar with the original code's syntax.
