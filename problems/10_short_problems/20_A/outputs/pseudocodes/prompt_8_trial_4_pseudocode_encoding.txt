**Purpose:**
The goal of the code is to read a path from standard input, normalize it by removing unnecessary components, and then adjust the path format to ensure it starts with a single forward slash.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Import Required Libraries:**
   - Import functionality for handling file paths (specifically, `posixpath` for path normalization).
   - Import functionality for reading standard input (`sys` for input handling).
   - Import tools for regular expression search and replacement (`re` for regex operations).

2. **Read Input:**
   - Read a string input from the user (the input represents a file path).
   - Remove any leading or trailing spaces from the input.

3. **Normalize Path:**
   - Normalize the input path to eliminate any redundant components (like `..` or `.`) using the path normalization function.

4. **Adjust Path Format:**
   - Modify the normalized path to ensure there is only one leading forward slash ('/').
   - If the path starts with more than one '/', replace it with a single '/'. If there are no leading slashes, it will remain unchanged.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final adjusted path.

**Detailed Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Import necessary modules
    IMPORT path handling functions FOR POSIX
    IMPORT input reading functions
    IMPORT regular expression functions

    // Step 2: Read input path from user
    SET inputPath TO read from standard input
    REMOVE leading and trailing spaces FROM inputPath

    // Step 3: Normalize the input path
    SET normalizedPath TO normalize inputPath

    // Step 4: Adjust path to start with a single slash
    SET adjustedPath TO replace all leading slashes in normalizedPath WITH one slash

    // Step 5: Output the final adjusted path
    PRINT adjustedPath
END
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The import statements are necessary for handling paths and input.
- Normalization simplifies the path by cleaning up any unnecessary parts.
- The output ensures that the path is formatted correctly for use in POSIX systems.
