**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to read a file path from input, normalize it by eliminating redundant slashes at the beginning, and output the cleaned-up version of that path.

**Pseudocode:**

```
1. Start the program
2. Read input from the standard input source (e.g., user or file)
3. Remove unnecessary leading whitespace from the input
4. Normalize the file path:
   a. If there are multiple consecutive slashes at the beginning, replace them with a single slash
5. Output the normalized file path
6. End the program
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

- **Step 1:** Begin the execution of the program.
- **Step 2:** Capture the input which represents a file path. This can come from user input or from a file that is read by the program.
- **Step 3:** Trim any surrounding whitespace from the captured input to clean it up for further processing.
- **Step 4:** Normalize the file path by ensuring that if the path starts with multiple slashes, they are replaced with a single slash. This helps ensure that the path format is consistent.
- **Step 5:** Display the resulting normalized file path to the output.
- **Step 6:** Conclude the program execution.

This pseudocode captures the essence of the logic in the original code while ensuring clarity and accessibility for readers.
