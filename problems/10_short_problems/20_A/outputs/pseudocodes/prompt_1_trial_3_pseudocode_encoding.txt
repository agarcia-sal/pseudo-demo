**Pseudocode: Normalize File Path Input**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Read Input:**
   - Read a string input from the standard input (e.g., console or file).
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace characters from the input string.

3. **Normalize Path:**
   - Use a function to standardize the file path:
     - Replace any sequences of forward slashes ("/") at the beginning of the path with a single forward slash ("/").
     - Ensure that the path follows the proper format by fixing inconsistencies in its structure.

4. **Output Result:**
   - Display the normalized file path to the standard output.

**End of Program**
