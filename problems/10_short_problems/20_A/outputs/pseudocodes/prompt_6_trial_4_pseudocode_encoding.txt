```
1. Import necessary libraries for handling file paths and reading input.
   
2. Read the entire input from standard input (which may contain a file path).
3. Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.

4. Normalize the file path:
   a. Transform the file path to a standard format, handling any irregularities in slashes (e.g., converting backslashes to forward slashes if needed).
   
5. Process the normalized file path to ensure it starts with a single forward slash:
   a. If the normalized string has multiple leading slashes, replace them with a single forward slash.

6. Output the final processed file path.

# Summary of operations:
# - Read input
# - Normalize file path for consistent format
# - Simplify leading slashes to a single slash
# - Print the final result
