**Pseudocode:**

1. **Begin Program**

2. **Input Handling:**
   - Read a string of text from the standard input, which represents a file path.
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from this input string.
   - Store this cleaned-up string in a variable called `inputPath`.

3. **Normalize File Path:**
   - Apply a normalization process to the `inputPath` to ensure it has a standard structure for file paths. 
   - Store the result in a variable called `normalizedPath`.

4. **Adjust Leading Slashes:**
   - Modify `normalizedPath` to ensure that if it starts with one or more slashes, it should be changed to a single leading slash.
   - Use a substitution method to replace any leading slashes with a single slash and store the final result in a variable called `finalPath`.

5. **Output Result:**
   - Display or print the `finalPath`.

6. **End Program**
