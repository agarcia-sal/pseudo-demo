### Explanation:

1. **Purpose Clarification:** The pseudocode describes a function that normalizes a file path input by removing unnecessary elements and ensuring any leading slashes are standardized to a single slash.

2. **Meaningful Names:** Functions and variable names clearly indicate their purpose, e.g., `normalize_and_sanitize_path`, `normalize`, `replace_leading_slashes`.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** The pseudocode summarizes the operations without specific programming language syntax, focusing on the core logic.

4. **Control Structures:** The pseudocode uses clear conditional statements and function calls to outline the flow of logic.

5. **Input and Output:** It explicitly states that input is read from standard input and outputs a sanitized path.

6. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode maintains a consistent structure, breaking the logic into manageable functions.

7. **Natural Language:** The language is simple and accessible, avoiding technical jargon.

8. **Review for Clarity:** The pseudocode is coherent, reflecting the operations of the original code accurately.

9. **Context for Complexity:** Brief explanations of the normalization and leading slash replacement are included in the respective functions to clarify their purposes.

10. **Final Output Expectations:** The pseudocode outlines expected behavior to process paths cleanly, enhancing understanding for various audiences.
