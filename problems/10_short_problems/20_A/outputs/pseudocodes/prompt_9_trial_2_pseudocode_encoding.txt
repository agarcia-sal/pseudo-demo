**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to normalize a file path by removing any redundant slashes at the beginning and ensuring the path is standardized.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read the entire input from the user which contains a file path.

2. **Normalize the Path:**
   - Strip any whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) from the beginning and end of the input file path.
   - Normalize the path to ensure it uses standard separators (e.g., converting backslashes to forward slashes).

3. **Remove Leading Slashes:**
   - If the normalized path starts with one or more slashes, replace them with a single leading slash.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Display the modified path to the user.

**Detailed Steps:**

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

  // Step 1: Receive User Input
  DEFINE filePath AS INPUT from the user

  // Step 2: Normalize the Path
  SET normalizedPath TO the normalized version of filePath
  REMOVE leading and trailing whitespace from normalizedPath

  // Step 3: Remove Leading Slashes
  IF normalizedPath starts with one or more slashes THEN
    REPLACE leading slashes with a single slash
  END IF

  // Step 4: Display the Final Path
  PRINT the modified normalizedPath

END PROGRAM
```

This pseudocode provides a clear representation of the original code's logic, making it easier for readers to understand the process of normalizing a file path without needing specific programming language knowledge.
