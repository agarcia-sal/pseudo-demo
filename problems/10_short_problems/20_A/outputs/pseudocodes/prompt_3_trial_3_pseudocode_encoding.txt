// Pseudocode for Normalizing File Paths

// Read input from standard input (usually a file or command line)
INPUT: Read the entire input as a single string, which represents a file path or directory

// Normalize the file path
1. Assign the input string to a variable named "inputPath"
2. Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from "inputPath"
3. Normalize "inputPath" by converting it to a standard format:
   a. Replace all occurrences of backslashes with forward slashes
   b. Collapse multiple consecutive forward slashes into a single forward slash
   c. Ensure normalization does not produce a leading slash if unnecessary

// Output the normalized path
OUTPUT: Print the normalized file path
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

- **INPUT** describes the step of reading the file path input. 
- The first step assigns the user-provided path to a variable and trims any unnecessary whitespace.
- The normalization steps detail how to standardize the file path formatting, ensuring that multiple slashes are reduced to a single one.
- **OUTPUT** specifies printing the final normalized file path for the user to see. 

This structure maintains clarity and focuses on the overall algorithm rather than the exact technical syntax, making it understandable for individuals unfamiliar with the original code.
