```pseudocode
// Read input from standard input and normalize the path
normalizedPath = normalizePath(readInput())

// Remove leading slashes from the normalized path
outputPath = removeLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)

// Print the final output path
print(outputPath)

// Function to read input
FUNCTION readInput()
    RETURN user input from standard input, stripped of leading/trailing spaces

// Function to normalize the path
FUNCTION normalizePath(inputPath)
    RETURN normalized version of inputPath using POSIX path conventions

// Function to remove leading slashes
FUNCTION removeLeadingSlashes(path)
    RETURN path with leading slashes replaced by a single slash (if any)
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading input from standard input, representing the original data entry point.
2. **Normalization**: It normalizes the path to ensure it adheres to POSIX standards.
3. **Leading Slash Removal**: The algorithm then processes the normalized path to ensure it does not start with multiple slashes, preserving just one if applicable.
4. **Output**: Finally, the cleaned path is printed as the output, providing a user-friendly result. 

Each function is clearly defined to make the flow and purpose of the code easy to understand.
