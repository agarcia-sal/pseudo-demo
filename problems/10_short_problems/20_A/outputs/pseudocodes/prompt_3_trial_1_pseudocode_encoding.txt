Here is the pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read input from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace
    INPUT rawPath FROM standard input
    TRIM rawPath of whitespace to create normalizedPath
    
    // Step 2: Normalize the path to handle any redundant separators
    NORMALIZE normalizedPath BY replacing multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    
    // Step 3: Output the normalized path
    OUTPUT normalizedPath

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by capturing the input from the user and ensuring that any unnecessary whitespace is removed.
- **Path Normalization**: The logic to normalize the path is expressed in simple terms, indicating that multiple leading slashes should be reduced to a single slash.
- **Output**: Finally, the normalized path is displayed as the output. 

The pseudocode is structured to be easily understandable, focusing on the intent and processes described in the original Python code without specific syntax tied to programming language conventions.
