### Purpose
The main goal of this code is to read a file path from input, normalize it by removing any redundant separators, and ensure it starts with a single leading slash.

### Pseudocode

1. **Define Main Functionality:**
   - Create a function called `NormalizeFilePath` that performs the following actions:

2. **Read Input:**
   - Read the file path from the standard input.
   - Remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the input.

3. **Normalize the Path:**
   - Apply a method to adjust the file path:
     - Replace multiple consecutive leading slashes (//) with a single leading slash (/).
     - This ensures that the path is in a standard format.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the normalized file path.

### Detailed Steps

```
FUNCTION NormalizeFilePath
    # Step 1: Read the input file path
    INPUT rawFilePath FROM standard input

    # Step 2: Strip any leading or trailing whitespace
    normalizedPath = TRIM(rawFilePath)

    # Step 3: Normalize the path
    # Replace multiple leading slashes with a single leading slash
    IF normalizedPath starts with one or more slashes THEN
        normalizedPath = REMOVE_LEADING_SLASHES(normalizedPath)
        normalizedPath = ADD_SINGLE_LEADING_SLASH(normalizedPath)
    ENDIF

    # Step 4: Print the normalized file path
    PRINT normalizedPath
END FUNCTION
```

### Comments for Clarity
- **TRIM**: This function removes any unnecessary whitespace before and after the string.
- **REMOVE_LEADING_SLASHES**: This step checks for multiple slashes at the beginning and reduces them to one.
- **ADD_SINGLE_LEADING_SLASH**: Ensures there is exactly one slash at the start of the filepath.

### Example Input and Output
- **Input**: `//user//documents//file.txt`
- **Output**: `/user/documents/file.txt`

### Review and Refinement
- This pseudocode is structured logically, making it easy to read and understand.
- Each operation is broken down clearly, using simple terms and processes that can be grasped by someone not familiar with programming syntax.
