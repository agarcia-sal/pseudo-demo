Here's the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION NormalizeAndCleanPath(inputString)
    // Step 1: Normalize the input path using the posixpath library
    SET normalizedPath TO normalize the inputString

    // Step 2: Remove any leading slashes from the normalized path
    SET cleanedPath TO remove leading slashes from normalizedPath

    // Step 3: Return the cleaned path
    RETURN cleanedPath
END FUNCTION

// Main process to read input and execute path normalization
READ inputString FROM standard input
SET finalPath TO NormalizeAndCleanPath(inputString)
PRINT finalPath
```

### Input and Output Details:
- **Input:** A string representing a file path, read from standard input.
- **Output:** A cleaned and normalized file path printed to standard output, with leading slashes removed.

### Context for Complexity:
- The function `normalize` refers to the operation of normalizing the file paths to a standard format using derived rules from the `posixpath` module, ensuring the path is suitable for UNIX-like systems.
- The operation of removing leading slashes ensures the path's format aligns with specific requirements, thereby preventing format issues in subsequent operations or applications where the path will be used.
