### Purpose Summary
The primary goal of this code is to read a file path from input, normalize it to remove any unnecessary elements, and print it in a standardized format.

### Pseudocode

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Read Input**
   - Define a variable named `rawInput` to read the input from the standard input source.
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the `rawInput`.

3. **Normalize the Path**
   - Define a variable named `normalizedPath` to apply normalization to the `rawInput`.
   - Normalize the path by removing any redundant path elements.

4. **Format Leading Slash**
   - Use a method to replace any leading slashes in `normalizedPath` with a single leading slash to ensure proper formatting.

5. **Output Result**
   - Print the formatted `normalizedPath` as the final result.

### Detailed Steps
- **Step 1**: Begin the program.
  
- **Step 2**: 
  - Read the entire input as a string.
  - Strip any whitespace from both ends of the input.

- **Step 3**: 
  - Use a normalization function to handle the file path correctly, removing any unnecessary components (e.g., double slashes, relative path indicators like `.` or `..`).

- **Step 4**: 
  - Ensure that if there are any leading slashes, they are reduced to a single leading slash. 

- **Step 5**: 
  - Output the final `normalizedPath` to the user.

### Example Pseudocode Structure
```
BEGIN

    // Step 2: Read input and clean it
    rawInput = READ input from standard input
    cleanedInput = TRIM rawInput

    // Step 3: Normalize the path
    normalizedPath = NORMALIZE cleanedInput

    // Step 4: Format leading slashes
    finalPath = REPLACE leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single leading slash

    // Step 5: Output the result
    PRINT finalPath

END
```

### Comments for Clarity
- The use of `TRIM` helps ensure that extra spaces do not affect the path processing.
- `NORMALIZE` should ensure the path is valid and uniform, following typical filesystem conventions.
- The `REPLACE` operation ensures that unnecessary leading slashes are handled appropriately, making the output consistent.
