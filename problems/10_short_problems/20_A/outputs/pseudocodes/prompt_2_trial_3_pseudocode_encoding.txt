**Pseudocode:**

1. **Begin the Program.**

2. **Read Input:**
   - Obtain a string of text from the standard input and remove any leading and trailing whitespace.

3. **Normalize the Path:**
   - Adjust the input string to correct any irregularities in the path formatting:
     - If the path contains any sequences of multiple slashes at the beginning, replace them with a single slash.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the newly formatted path to the standard output.

5. **End the Program.**

**Note:**
- The input is expected to be a file path or similar text provided by the user.
- The output will be a cleaned-up version of that input with correct path formatting.
