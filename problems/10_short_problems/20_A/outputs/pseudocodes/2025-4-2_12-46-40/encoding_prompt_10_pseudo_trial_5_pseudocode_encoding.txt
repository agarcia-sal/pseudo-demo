Below is the pseudocode that reflects the provided Python code while following the guided steps.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Main Procedure:**
   Begin procedure NormalizePath

2. **Read Input:**
   - Get input from the user through standard input
   - Store the input in variable `inputPath`

3. **Clean the Input Path:**
   - Normalize the `inputPath` to a standard format by:
     - Removing any redundant slashes
     - Store the result in variable `normalizedPath`

4. **Substitute Leading Slashes:**
   - Replace any leading slashes in the `normalizedPath` with a single leading slash
   - Store the final result in variable `finalPath`

5. **Output the Result:**
   - Print `finalPath`

6. **End Procedure**

**Assumptions:**
- It is assumed that `inputPath` is a string representing a file path.
- The process of normalizing the path handles various directory formats and extraneous slashes correctly.

**Explanation of Components:**

- **Input Reading:** This captures the file path from the user.
- **Normalization Function:** This step corrects various path formats by removing unnecessary components.
- **Replacement Logic:** This modifies the path to ensure it starts with a single `/` if it originally had leading slashes.
- **Output:** This displays the cleaned path for user verification.

Each step has been kept intentional and clear to ensure the logic and purpose are evident without detailed coding syntax.
