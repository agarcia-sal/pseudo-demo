**Pseudocode: Normalize File Path and Print Result**

1. **Start of Program**
2. **Read Input:**
   - Read a string from standard input, which represents a file path.
3. **Remove Extra Whitespace:**
   - Trim whitespace from the beginning and end of the input string.
4. **Normalize the File Path:**
   - Use a function to convert the file path into a standard format (removing redundant separators and up-level references).
5. **Adjust Leading Slashes:**
   - Check if the normalized path begins with one or more slashes.
   - If it does, replace these leading slashes with a single slash to ensure the path starts correctly.
6. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final adjusted file path.

**End of Program** 

This pseudocode summarizes the key steps of the original code without detailing the programming language syntax, focusing instead on the logical flow and operations performed.
