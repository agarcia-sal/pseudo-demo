**Purpose Summary**: The goal of this code is to read a file path input from the user, normalize it to remove any unnecessary components, and ensure that it begins with a single leading forward slash.

**Pseudocode**:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read the input file path from standard input
    INPUT userInput AS STRING

    // Step 2: Normalize the input path
    // This means removing any redundant separators or up-level references
    normalizedPath = NormalizePath(userInput)

    // Step 3: Ensure the normalized path starts with a single '/' 
    // If unnecessary leading slashes are present, replace them with a single one
    finalPath = ReplaceMultipleLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)
    
    // Step 4: Print the final normalized path
    OUTPUT finalPath

END

FUNCTION NormalizePath(inputPath AS STRING) AS STRING
    // Implement normalization by retaining relevant parts of the path
    RETURN normalizedInputPath // This removes irrelevant/path elements
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ReplaceMultipleLeadingSlashes(path AS STRING) AS STRING
    // Check for slashes at the start of the path
    // Replace any occurrence of multiple slashes with a single slash
    IF path STARTS WITH '/'' THEN
        RETURN path REPLACE MULTIPLE LEADING SLASHES WITH '/' 
    ELSE
        RETURN '/' + path // Prepend a single slash if none exists
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
- `INPUT` denotes reading data from the user.
- `OUTPUT` indicates displaying results.
- `NormalizePath` is responsible for cleaning up the path by removing unnecessary parts.
- `ReplaceMultipleLeadingSlashes` ensures the final output path format is consistent with a proper leading slash.

By following these steps, the pseudocode effectively captures the logic of the original code while remaining accessible to readers unfamiliar with programming syntax.
