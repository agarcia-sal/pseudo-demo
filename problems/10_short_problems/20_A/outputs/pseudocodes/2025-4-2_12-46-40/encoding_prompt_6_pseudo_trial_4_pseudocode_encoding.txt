**Pseudocode Description: Normalize and Simplify File Path Input**

1. **Start Program**
   - Read input from the user, which is expected to be a file path.

2. **Normalize the File Path**
   - Apply a normalization process to the input file path to ensure a standard format.
   - This includes removing any redundant or unnecessary elements from the path.

3. **Adjust Path Format**
   - Check if the normalized path begins with one or more forward slashes ("/").
   - If it does, replace those leading slashes with a single forward slash.

4. **Output the Result**
   - Display the modified file path to the user.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

  FUNCTION Main
    // Step 1: Read input from the standard input (user)
    INPUT userInput AS STRING
    
    // Step 2: Normalize the input file path
    normalizedPath = NormalizePath(userInput)
    
    // Step 3: Adjust leading slashes
    IF normalizedPath starts with "/" THEN
      normalizedPath = ReplaceMultipleLeadingSlashesWithOne(normalizedPath)

    // Step 4: Output the final normalized path
    OUTPUT normalizedPath

  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION NormalizePath(inputPath AS STRING) RETURNS STRING
    // This function normalizes the given file path
    RETURN a normalized version of inputPath

  FUNCTION ReplaceMultipleLeadingSlashesWithOne(path AS STRING) RETURNS STRING
    // This function replaces multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    RETURN path with leading slashes replaced by a single "/"

END PROGRAM
```

**Key Concepts Included:**
- Reading input and the core operation of normalizing a file path.
- The important step of adjusting how leading slashes are handled.
- Clearly defined functions for each significant task, improving modularity and readability.
