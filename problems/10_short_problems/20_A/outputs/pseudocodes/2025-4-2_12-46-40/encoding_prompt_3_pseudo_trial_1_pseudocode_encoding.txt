Here's the pseudocode that reflects the logic and purpose of the provided code snippet:

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Read input data from standard input (console)
    INPUT rawFilePath

    // Normalize the path to a standard format
    normalizedPath = NormalizePath(rawFilePath)

    // Print the adjusted normalized path
    OUTPUT AdjustedPath(normalizedPath)

END PROGRAM

FUNCTION NormalizePath(inputPath)
    // Remove leading slashes from the path
    adjustedPath = RemoveLeadingSlashes(inputPath)

    // Return the normalized path
    RETURN adjustedPath
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION RemoveLeadingSlashes(path)
    // Replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    RETURN ReplaceMultipleLeadingSlashesWithSingleSlash(path)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ReplaceMultipleLeadingSlashesWithSingleSlash(path)
    // Use a regular expression to perform the replacement
    RETURN Replace '^/+' with '/' in path
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- The program begins by reading a file path input from the standard input (usually the user).
- The path is normalized through multiple steps: first, it removes any leading slashes, and then it is adjusted using a regular expression to ensure only a single leading slash remains if any.
- Finally, the adjusted path is printed as the output.
- Functions are used to encapsulate the normalization logic, improving organization and readability.

This structure allows someone unfamiliar with the original code to grasp the underlying logic and flow of the program.
