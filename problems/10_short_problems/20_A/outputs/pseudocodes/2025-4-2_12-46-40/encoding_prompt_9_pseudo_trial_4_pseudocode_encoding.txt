**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it to remove redundant sections, and ensure the path begins with a single forward slash.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Read Input:**
   - Read the entire input from the user, which is expected to be a file path.

3. **Normalize Path:**
   - Remove any redundant separators in the path.
   - This process ensures that any unnecessary or duplicate sections of the path are eliminated.

4. **Ensure Leading Slash:**
   - Check if the normalized path starts with more than one forward slash.
   - If it does, replace it with a single forward slash.

5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the final normalized path.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

   // Step 1: Read entire file path input
   INPUT filePath FROM standard input

   // Step 2: Normalize the file path
   normalizedPath = normalize_path(filePath)

   // Step 3: Ensure that the normalized path starts with a single forward slash
   IF normalizedPath starts with '/' repeated more than once THEN
       normalizedPath = REPLACE multiple slashes at the start with a single slash
   END IF

   // Step 4: Output the final normalized path
   PRINT normalizedPath

END PROGRAM

// Helper Function
FUNCTION normalize_path(inputPath)
   // Implement normalization logic that removes redundant sections from the path
   RETURN normalizedPath
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Structure:
- **BEGIN PROGRAM / END PROGRAM**: Clearly define the start and end of the program.
- **INPUT**: Describes reading the input from standard input.
- **NORMALIZATION**: Abstracts the details of how normalization is done while emphasizing the end result.
- **CONDITIONAL**: Plainly expresses the logic for ensuring the path adheres to format requirements.
- **PRINT**: Indicates the output of the final result.

### Final Check for Clarity:
The pseudocode is clear and follows an understandable flow, representing the core logic without technical jargon. It captures all significant operations and adheres to a logical sequence that matches the original code's intent.
