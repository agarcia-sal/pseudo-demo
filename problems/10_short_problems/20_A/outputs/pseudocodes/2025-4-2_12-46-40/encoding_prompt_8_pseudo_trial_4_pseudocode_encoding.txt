### Purpose
The objective of this code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it by removing any unnecessary path separators, and ensuring that the path formats correctly with a single leading slash, if applicable.

### Pseudocode
```
DEFINE FUNCTION main
    // Read the input from standard input
    SET inputPath as the normalized version of the path read from input
    
    // Remove leading slashes, ensuring at most one leading slash
    SET normalizedPath as the result of replacing multiple leading slashes with a single leading slash in inputPath
    
    // Print the normalized path to output
    PRINT normalizedPath
END FUNCTION

// Start execution by calling the main function
CALL main
```

### Breakdown of Operations
1. **Reading Input**: Capture the entire input path from standard input and strip any extra whitespace around it.
2. **Normalizing the Path**: Use a method to clean the path, ensuring that it follows a proper format by removing unnecessary parts.
3. **Replacing Leading Slashes**: Implement a rule to manage leading slashes so that only a single leading slash is kept, if any.
4. **Output**: Display the cleaned-up path to standard output.

### Comments for Clarity
- The function `main` is the entry point of the program.
- `inputPath` holds the original path read from standard input after normalization to ensure it adheres to POSIX path standards.
- `normalizedPath` applies a regular expression to ensure the path has a correctly formatted leading slash.

This structure presents the code's functionality clearly, breaking down the logic into understandable steps and variable names, making it accessible for readers with varying programming backgrounds.
