```plaintext
// Read input path from standard input
inputPath ← read input from standard input

// Normalize the input path
normalizedPath ← normalize path using POSIX standards

// Remove leading slashes, ensuring at least one leading slash remains
resultPath ← replace leading slashes with a single leading slash in normalizedPath

// Output the final processed path
print resultPath
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: The pseudocode starts by capturing input from standard input.
2. **Normalization**: It converts the path to a normalized format consistent with POSIX standards.
3. **Leading Slashes Handling**: It replaces any leading slashes with one leading slash for formatting purposes.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the processed path to standard output. 

This captures the essential logic of the original code without delving into specific programming language constructs.
