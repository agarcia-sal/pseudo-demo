**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it by removing any unnecessary segments, and ensure that it starts with a single forward slash.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: 
   - Import a library for handling file path operations.
   - Import a library for reading from the system input.
   - Import a library for pattern matching and text replacement.

2. **Read Input Path**:
   - Read a string from system input.
   - Remove any surrounding whitespace from the read input.

3. **Normalize the Path**:
   - Use a function to standardize the format of the path, correcting any irregularities in how the path is represented.

4. **Ensure Leading Slash**:
   - Modify the path to ensure it begins with exactly one forward slash. If the path starts with multiple slashes, change it to a single slash.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - Print or return the modified path to the user, showing the normalized version.

**Detailed Steps**:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Initialize environment
    IMPORT posixpath
    IMPORT sys
    IMPORT re

    // Step 2: Read input path
    STRING inputPath = READ from system input and strip extra whitespace

    // Step 3: Normalize the path
    STRING normalizedPath = NORMALIZE using posixpath library(inputPath)

    // Step 4: Ensure leading forward slash
    STRING finalPath = REPLACE any leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single '/'

    // Step 5: Output the final path
    PRINT finalPath

END
```

**Notes**:
- The function `NORMALIZE` represents the action of normalizing the path, provided by the `posixpath` library, which cleans up the path according to filesystem rules.
- The `REPLACE` action is made simpler to reflect the regular expression operation used in the original code to substitute any leading slashes with a single slash.
- The program uses standard input to receive data, which aligns with many command-line applications where file paths are provided at execution.
