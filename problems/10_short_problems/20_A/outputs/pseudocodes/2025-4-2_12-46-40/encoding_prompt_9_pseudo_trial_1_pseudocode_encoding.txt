**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to read a file path input from the user, normalize the path by removing any unnecessary segments, and ensure that the path has a leading slash if it starts with multiple slashes.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read input data as a string from the standard input (e.g., user input or file).

3. **Normalize Path:**
   - Remove any redundant segments from the path:
     - Use a method to clean up the path which may include resolving any ".." or "." within the path.

4. **Ensure Single Leading Slash:**
   - Check if the normalized path starts with multiple slashes:
     - If yes, replace the beginning with a single slash.
   
5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the final normalized path to the standard output.

6. **End Program**

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Read the user's input and remove any extra spaces from both ends of the input.
2. Normalize the path to ensure:
   - It does not include any unnecessary components that might confuse the file system.
3. If the normalized path begins with more than one slash:
   - Replace them with a single slash to maintain a proper format.
4. Display this corrected path to the user. 

This structure captures the essential logic and flow of the original code in a clear and accessible manner.
