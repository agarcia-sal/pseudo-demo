```
# Read input from the standard input (stdin)
Input: a string representing a file path

# Normalize the file path
normalizedPath = normalizePath(Input)

# Remove leading slashes from the normalized file path
finalPath = removeLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)

# Output the final modified file path
Output: finalPath

# Function to normalize the file path
Function normalizePath(path):
    Return the path with normalized separators (e.g., convert '\' to '/')

# Function to remove leading slashes from the path
Function removeLeadingSlashes(path):
    Return the path with leading '/' characters replaced by a single '/'
``` 

This pseudocode summarizes the key operations involved in reading, normalizing, and modifying a file path string, clearly presenting the flow and the transformations applied.
