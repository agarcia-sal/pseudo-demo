**Pseudocode: Normalize and Clean Path Input**

1. **Input:** 
   - Read a string input representing a file path from standard input.

2. **Process:**
   - **Step 1:** Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input path.
   - **Step 2:** Normalize the file path to ensure that it uses the correct directory separator and resolves any symbolic links or relative components.
   - **Step 3:** Replace any instances of multiple consecutive leading slashes ("/") in the normalized path with a single leading slash.

3. **Output:**
   - Print the cleaned and normalized file path to standard output.

**Detailed Steps:**
```
BEGIN
    INPUT pathString FROM standard input
    
    // Step 1: Trim whitespace from the path
    trimmedPath = REMOVE whitespace FROM pathString

    // Step 2: Normalize the path
    normalizedPath = NORMALIZE, using file system conventions FROM trimmedPath

    // Step 3: Replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    cleanedPath = SUBSTITUTE leading slashes such that:
        if there are multiple "/" at the start of normalizedPath
            change them to a single "/"
    
    // Step 4: Output the final cleaned path
    PRINT cleanedPath TO standard output
END
``` 

This pseudocode outlines the logical flow and operations of the original code, focusing on how it handles a file path input to produce a cleaned output.
