**Pseudocode: Normalize File Path**

1. **Start** the process.

2. **Read Input**:
   - Obtain a string input from the standard input, which represents a file path.
   - Remove any leading and trailing spaces from the input.

3. **Normalize the File Path**:
   - Modify the file path by replacing any sequence of slashes at the beginning of the path with a single slash.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Display the modified file path.

5. **End** the process. 

**Input Requirements**:
- The input should be a string representing a file path, which may contain extra spaces and leading slashes.

**Output Requirements**:
- The output will be a single normalized file path with any excess leading slashes removed and displayed as a single leading slash.
