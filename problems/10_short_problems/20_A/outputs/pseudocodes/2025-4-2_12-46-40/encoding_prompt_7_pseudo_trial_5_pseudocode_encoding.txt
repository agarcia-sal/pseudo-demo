### Explanation:
1. **Purpose Clarification:** The function reads a file path input, normalizes it to a standard format, and formats any leading slashes appropriately before printing it.

2. **Meaningful Names:** Variable names and function names describe their purpose clearly.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** The pseudocode summarizes the primary operations without going into the low-level details of how string manipulation is performed in code.

4. **Control Structures:** The pseudocode highlights logical flow with clear instructions, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

5. **Input and Output:** The input is taken from standard input and is expected to be a file path. The output is a formatted version of that path.

6. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode follows a structured approach for easy readability and understanding.

7. **Natural Language:** Actions are described in straightforward language, ensuring accessibility to readers of all programming backgrounds.

8. **Review for Clarity:** The pseudocode has been reviewed for coherence and clarity, effectively representing the logic of the original code.

9. **Context for Complexity:** While there are not many complex portions in this simple code, string replacements have been briefly explained.

10. **Final Output Expectations:** The pseudocode conveys the logical procedure accurately, showing the steps to normalize and print the file path.
