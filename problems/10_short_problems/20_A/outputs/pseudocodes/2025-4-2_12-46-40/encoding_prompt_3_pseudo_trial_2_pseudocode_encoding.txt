Here is the pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the given Python code snippet:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Read input from standard input
    INPUT rawPath  // This will receive the raw path string

    // Normalize the path
    normalizedPath = NormalizePath(rawPath)

    // Remove leading slashes from the normalized path
    finalPath = RemoveLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)

    // Print the resulting path
    OUTPUT finalPath

END

FUNCTION NormalizePath(pathString)
    // Replace the path with a normalized version
    RETURN normalized version of pathString

FUNCTION RemoveLeadingSlashes(pathString)
    // Replace any leading slashes at the start of the string with a single slash
    RETURN pathString after removing leading slashes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts with reading an input, which is a path string.

2. **Normalization:** It then normalizes the path using a function to ensure it has a proper format.

3. **Leading Slashes Removal:** The pseudocode defines a separate function to handle the removal of any excessive leading slashes from the normalized path.

4. **Output:** Finally, it outputs the cleaned-up version of the path.

This structured approach keeps the logic clear without delving into specific programming language syntax, making it understandable for someone unfamiliar with the original code.
