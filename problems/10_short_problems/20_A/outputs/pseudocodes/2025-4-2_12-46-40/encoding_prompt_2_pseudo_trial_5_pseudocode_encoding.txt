**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Accept input as a string from the standard input, and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Normalize Path:**
   - Convert the input string into a normalized file path format, ensuring that the path uses the correct separators and resolves any redundancies.

3. **Modify Leading Slashes:**
   - Check if the normalized path begins with one or more forward slashes.
   - If it does, replace the leading slashes with a single forward slash, ensuring there is only one at the beginning of the path.

4. **Output Result:**
   - Display the modified path as the output.

**Overall Logic Flow:**

- Begin by capturing the input from the user or system.
- Normalize the captured input to tidy it up.
- Adjust the beginning of the path to meet specific formatting rules related to leading characters.
- Finally, return or display the cleaned and standardized file path.
