**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it by removing any unnecessary symbols, and ensure it begins with a single forward slash.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Read Input**: 
   - Obtain the entire text input from the standard input device.
   - Remove any extra whitespace from the beginning and end of the input.

2. **Normalize File Path**: 
   - Apply a normalization process to the input path to format it correctly:
     - Convert the path to a format that eliminates any redundant separators and up-level references.
  
3. **Adjust Leading Slashes**: 
   - Modify the normalized path to ensure it starts with only one forward slash (if it starts with multiple slashes).

4. **Output Result**: 
   - Print the adjusted path to the standard output.

**Pseudocode Representation**:

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Read input
    originalPath = READ input from standard input
    trimmedPath = REMOVE extra spaces from both ends of originalPath

    // Step 2: Normalize the file path
    normalizedPath = NORMALIZE(trimmedPath)

    // Step 3: Ensure the path starts with a single forward slash
    finalPath = REPLACE multiple leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single slash

    // Step 4: Output the final result
    PRINT finalPath to standard output
END
```

**Additional Comments**:
- The function `NORMALIZE` represents a process that would typically involve resolving any navigation symbols such as `..` or `.` that are used in file paths.
- The `REPLACE` function used here indicates a transformation in which multiple occurrences of the forward slash are condensed to a single slash only at the beginning of the path.
- This pseudocode presents a simplified view of the logic, and real implementations may involve error handling which is not explicitly mentioned here for clarity.
