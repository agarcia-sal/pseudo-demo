**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to normalize a file path by removing redundant slashes (for example, converting multiple leading slashes to a single slash) before outputting the final cleaned path.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Read the entire input from standard input (assumed to be a file path)
    INPUT rawPath FROM standard input
    
    // Normalize the file path by removing redundant path separators
    normalizedPath = NORMALIZE_PATH(rawPath)

    // Output the cleaned path
    PRINT normalizedPath

END

FUNCTION NORMALIZE_PATH(pathString):
    
    // Use the built-in functionality to normalize the path
    // This will convert the path to a standard format, cleaning up any redundant separators
    cleanedPath = standardize(pathString)

    // Replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash at the start of the path
    cleanedPath = REPLACE_LEADING_SLASHES(cleanedPath)
    
    RETURN cleanedPath

FUNCTION standardize(pathString):
    // This function would perform internal path normalization (like converting backslashes to slashes)
    // Here, we let it assume the shaping of the path based on the platform-specific requirements
    RETURN pathString   // Placeholder for actual internal standardization logic

FUNCTION REPLACE_LEADING_SLASHES(cleanedPath):
    // Check if the path starts with one or more slashes
    // Replace all occurrences of multiple slashes at the beginning with a single slash
    WHILE cleanedPath starts with two or more slashes:
        cleanedPath = REMOVE_ONE_SLASH_FROM_START(cleanedPath)
    
    RETURN cleanedPath

FUNCTION REMOVE_ONE_SLASH_FROM_START(path):
    // Remove one leading slash from the given path
    RETURN path without the first character

END
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- Each function has a specific responsibility: normalizing the entire path, standardizing format, and replacing leading slashes.
- The `normalization` involves converting path separators consistent with the operating system's standards, while `leading slashes` are specifically handled to avoid redundancy.
- This structure keeps the logic clear and allows for easy understanding of how each part contributes to the overall goal of cleaning the file path.
