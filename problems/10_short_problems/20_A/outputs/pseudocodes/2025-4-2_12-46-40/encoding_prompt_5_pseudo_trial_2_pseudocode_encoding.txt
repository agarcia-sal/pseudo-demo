### Purpose
The code is designed to read a file path from the standard input, normalize it to ensure it uses the correct format, and then print a modified version of the path that removes any leading slashes.

### Pseudocode

1. **Define Function to Normalize File Path**
   - Create a function named `normalize_file_path` which will process a user-provided file path.

2. **Input Handling**
   - Read the input from the user:
     - **Input**: A file path received as a string.

3. **Normalize the Path**
   - Normalize the input file path to a standard format:
     - Use a method that converts any path format to a POSIX-compliant format.

4. **Remove Leading Slashes**
   - Transform the normalized path by:
     - Replacing any leading slashes (`/`) with a single slash (`/`).
     - If the path starts with more than one slash, turn it into one leading `/`.

5. **Output the Result**
   - Print the modified file path.

### Detailed Pseudocode

```plaintext
FUNCTION normalize_file_path
    // Step 1: Read the input
    SET inputPath TO read file path from standard input

    // Step 2: Normalize the path
    SET normalizedPath TO convert inputPath to POSIX format

    // Step 3: Remove leading slashes
    SET finalPath TO replace leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single leading slash

    // Step 4: Print the resulting path
    OUTPUT finalPath
END FUNCTION

// Main execution
CALL normalize_file_path
```

### Comments
- **Normalization** refers to adjusting the file path into a consistent format.
- **Leading Slashes** are removed to ensure the path starts in a standard manner.
- **Output** will display the formatted file path to the user.

### Example of Input/Output
- Input: `///user//docs//file.txt`
- Output: `/user/docs/file.txt` 

This pseudocode provides a clear and comprehensible representation of the program's logic, suitable for readers unfamiliar with the original code structure.
