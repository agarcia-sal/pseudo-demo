Here's the pseudocode that represents the original algorithm clearly and understandably:

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Read input from standard input and remove extra spaces
    SET inputPath TO read input from the standard input
    REMOVE leading and trailing whitespace from inputPath

    // Normalize the file path
    SET normalizedPath TO normalize the path (inputPath)
    
    // Replace any sequence of leading slashes with a single slash
    SET finalPath TO replace leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single slash

    // Output the final normalized path
    PRINT finalPath

END PROGRAM

FUNCTION normalize the path(inputPath):
    // This function transforms the file path to a standard format
    // Implementation details depend on specific requirements for normalization
    RETURN normalized path version of inputPath

FUNCTION replace leading slashes(path):
    // This function replaces sequences of leading slashes at the start of the path
    WHILE path starts with one or more slashes do
        REMOVE leading slash from path
    END WHILE
    RETURN path with a single leading slash
```

### Key Components Explained:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode explicitly states that it reads input from standard input and manages whitespace.

2. **Path Normalization**: The normalization step is represented as a function, allowing for flexibility in how this process is defined or implemented.

3. **Leading Slash Handling**: A separate function dynamically handles the leading slashes, ensuring clarity in the logic used to modify the path.

4. **Output**: The program concludes with the printing of the final processed path, making it clear what the end result will be. 

This structure should be understandable to someone without programming experience, while still clearly outlining the logic behind the original code.
