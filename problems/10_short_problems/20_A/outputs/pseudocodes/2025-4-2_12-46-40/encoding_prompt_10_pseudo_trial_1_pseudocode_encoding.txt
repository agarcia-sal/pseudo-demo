Hereâ€™s the pseudocode based on the provided code, incorporating the steps outlined:

**Pseudocode: Normalize and Clean File Path**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Define a string variable `inputString` to hold the input from the user.

2. **Read Input:**
   - Set `inputString` to the content read from the standard input, removing any leading or trailing whitespace.

3. **Normalize Path:**
   - Set `normalizedPath` to the result of normalizing `inputString` using the path normalization method.
   - (*Assumption: The normalization method adjusts the path format to a standard representation.*)

4. **Clean Up Path:**
   - Set `cleanedPath` to a modified version of `normalizedPath` where all leading slashes are replaced with a single slash.
   - (*Assumption: The regex operation replaces multiple leading slashes at the beginning of the path with a singular slash.*)

5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the `cleanedPath`.

---

**Explanation of Main Components:**
- **Input Reading:** Handles user input and prepares it for processing.
- **Normalization:** Adjusts the path for uniform formatting.
- **Regular Expression Substitution:** Cleans up the path to ensure proper leading format.
- **Output:** Displays the final cleaned path to the user.

---

**Assumptions:**
- Input is a string representing a file path.
- Leading whitespace is irrelevant and should be stripped out.
- The normalization method is assumed to be part of standard path handling utilities.

This pseudocode maintains clarity and presents the steps logically, making it easy to understand the intended process without relying on specific programming language syntax.
