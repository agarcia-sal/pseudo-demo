### Purpose
The goal of the following code is to normalize a given file path by removing any leading slashes and ensuring the path conforms to a standard format.

### Pseudocode
```
DEFINE FUNCTION normalizeFilePath
    INPUT: A string representing a file path

    STEP 1: Read the file path from standard input
    SET filePath TO the input string with any extra spaces removed

    STEP 2: Normalize the file path
    SET normalizedPath TO the normalized version of filePath using system path conventions

    STEP 3: Remove leading slashes
    SET finalPath TO the normalizedPath with all leading slashes replaced by a single slash

    STEP 4: Output the result
    PRINT finalPath
END FUNCTION
```

### Detailed Breakdown
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a file path from standard input and removes unnecessary spaces.
   
2. **Normalization Process**:
   - The `normalizedPath` is created by using a function that ensures the file path follows system-specific conventions (such as resolving parent directory references).

3. **Leading Slash Handling**:
   - The `finalPath` is derived by replacing multiple leading slashes at the start of the `normalizedPath` with a single slash to maintain a standard file structure.

4. **Output**: Finally, the cleaned-up file path is printed as the output.

### Example of Input/Output
- **Input**: "///home/user//documents///file.txt"
- **Output**: "/home/user/documents/file.txt"

### Comments for Clarity
- The function primarily focuses on ensuring that the file path is neatly formatted for further processing or usage.
- The use of regular expressions helps simplify the task of removing extra leading slashes.

### Structure Overview
- Organize into clearly defined steps that can be followed easily, helping readers to understand the logic without needing code-specific syntax.
