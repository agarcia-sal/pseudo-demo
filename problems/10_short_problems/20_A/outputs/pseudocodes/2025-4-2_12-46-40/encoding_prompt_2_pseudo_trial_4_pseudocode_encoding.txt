**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Get the entire input from the standard input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. 
   - Store this cleaned input in a variable called `inputPath`.

2. **Normalize Path:**
   - Normalize the `inputPath` to ensure it follows the correct format for a filesystem path. 
   - This will adjust any irregularities in the path format and store the result in a variable called `normalizedPath`.

3. **Remove Leading Slashes:**
   - Modify the `normalizedPath` to replace any leading slashes with a single slash. 
   - To achieve this, search for occurrences of one or more slashes at the beginning of the path and replace them with a single slash.

4. **Output Result:**
   - Display the modified path as the final output.

**Clarifications:**
- The input is assumed to be a string representing a file or directory path.
- The final output will be a properly formatted path with all leading slashes condensed into one.
