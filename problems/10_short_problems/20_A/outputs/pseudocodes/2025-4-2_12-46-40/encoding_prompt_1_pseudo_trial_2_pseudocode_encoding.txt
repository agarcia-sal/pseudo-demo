**Pseudocode: Normalize and Clean File Path Input**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Get Input:**
   - Read the entire input from the standard input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - Store the cleaned input in a variable called `inputString`.

3. **Normalize Path:**
   - Use a function to normalize the file path:
     - Convert the input string into a normalized path format which resolves any relative path components.
     - Store the normalized path in a variable called `normalizedPath`.
   
4. **Clean Path:**
   - Use a function to modify the normalized path:
     - Replace any sequence of leading forward slashes ("/") at the beginning of `normalizedPath` with a single forward slash ("/").
     - Store the result in a variable called `cleanedPath`.
   
5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the `cleanedPath`.

6. **End Program** 

This pseudocode captures the essential steps of reading a file path input, normalizing it, cleaning up the format, and then outputting the final path.
