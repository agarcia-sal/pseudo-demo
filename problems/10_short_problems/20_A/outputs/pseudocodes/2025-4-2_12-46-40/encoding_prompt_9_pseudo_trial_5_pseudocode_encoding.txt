**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this code is to read a file path from the standard input, normalize it to a standard format, and remove any leading slashes.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Obtain a string input representing a file path from the user.

2. **Normalize the File Path:**
   - Transform the input file path into a canonical form. 
   - This involves cleaning up the path by resolving any redundant separators.

3. **Remove Leading Slashes:**
   - Check the normalized path for any leading slashes.
   - If any leading slashes are present, remove them to ensure the final output starts with a single slash.

4. **Output the Resulting Path:**
   - Display or print the final file path after normalization and removal of leading slashes.

**Detailed Steps:**

- **Step 1: Read Input**
  - Input the file path from the user via standard input.
  
- **Step 2: Normalize the File Path**
  - Use a method to standardize the format of the input path.
    - This may include removing unnecessary dots and extra slashes.

- **Step 3: Remove Leading Slashes**
  - Check if the normalized path starts with more than one slash.
  - If it does, replace it with a single slash at the beginning.
  
- **Step 4: Output the Final Path**
  - Print the cleaned file path to the standard output.

**Example of Input and Output:**
- **Input:** `////home/user///documents//file.txt`
- **Output:** `/home/user/documents/file.txt`
