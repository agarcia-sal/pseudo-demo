**Purpose:** This algorithm processes a file path input, normalizes it by removing redundant components, and ensures it begins with a single root slash.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read the entire input from standard input (usually the command line).
   - Remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the input.

2. **Normalize the File Path:**
   - Take the cleaned input and convert it into a normalized format.
   - This means resolving any redundant or unnecessarily represented path elements.

3. **Adjust the Path:**
   - If the normalized path has multiple root slashes at the beginning, replace them with a single root slash.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the final path to the standard output.

**Detailed Steps:**

- START
  - DECLARE variable `filePath`
  - SET `filePath` to the result of reading input from standard input and removing extra whitespace
  - SET `normalizedPath` to the normalized version of `filePath` (removing unnecessary path elements)
  - SET `finalPath` to `normalizedPath`, ensuring it starts with a single root slash
    - IF `finalPath` starts with more than one root slash
      - REPLACE multiple leading slashes with a single root slash
  - PRINT `finalPath`
- END

This pseudocode maintains the logic of the original code while being straightforward and easy to understand. Each step is described to convey the flow of operations clearly.
