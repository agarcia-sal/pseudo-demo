**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it to a standard format, and then modify it by ensuring that it starts with a single forward slash, removing any leading slashes that come before the first one.

**Pseudocode:**  

```
1. Define a function called NormalizeFilePath that performs the following actions:
    
    1.1. Read the input file path from the user.
    
    1.2. Remove any unnecessary elements from the path to standardize its format:
        - This involves converting the path to a normal form where redundant separators are eliminated.
    
    1.3. Modify the path to ensure it begins with exactly one forward slash:
        - If the path starts with multiple slashes, replace them with a single slash.
    
    1.4. Output the modified path to the user.

2. Call the NormalizeFilePath function to execute the normalization process.
```

**Detailed Steps:**  

```
1. Function NormalizeFilePath:
   
   1.1. Input: Read a string from standard input which represents the file path.
       - Example: "/some//folder//file.txt"

   1.2. Process the input to eliminate redundant parts:
       - Normalize the path using a method that standardizes the format.
       - Normalize means that every sequence of slashes should be reduced to a single slash.
       - For example, "/some//folder//" becomes "/some/folder/".

   1.3. Ensure the output starts with a single forward slash:
       - Check if the normalized path starts with more than one slash.
       - If it does, replace all leading slashes (if present) with exactly one slash.
       - For instance, "////some/folder/file.txt" becomes "/some/folder/file.txt".

   1.4. Output: Print the finalized normalized file path.
       - Example Output: "/some/folder/file.txt"
```

**Comments for Clarity:**  
- The `sys.stdin.read()` function is used to allow the user to input a path through standard input.
- The `posixpath.normpath()` function is responsible for normalizing the file path by removing redundant slashes and backtracking.
- The `re.sub()` function is used to apply the regular expression that ensures only one leading slash remains.

**Example Structure of Use:**
- When the user provides an input like "///directory/file.txt", the function first normalizes it to "/directory/file.txt" and then ensures it remains as "/directory/file.txt" before printing it as output.

This pseudocode is designed to be easily understandable and provides a clear overview of the logic without delving into programming-specific syntax.
