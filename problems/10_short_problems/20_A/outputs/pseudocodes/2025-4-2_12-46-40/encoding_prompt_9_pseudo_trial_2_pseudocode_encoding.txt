**Purpose:** The aim of this code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize the path by removing any redundant segments, and ensure it starts with a single forward slash.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize System:**
   - Import necessary libraries for handling file paths and regular expressions.

2. **Read Input:**
   - Get a file path from the standard input and remove any extra spaces around it.

3. **Normalize Path:**
   - Adjust the file path to ensure it follows standard formatting rules for file paths.
     - This includes converting the path into a normalized version which eliminates any unnecessary segments.

4. **Adjust Forward Slashes:**
   - Replace instances where there are multiple forward slashes at the beginning of the path with a single forward slash.

5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the final processed file path.

**Detailed Steps:**

- Begin the program and ensure necessary tools are ready for use.
  
- Step 1: **Get Input**
  - Read the file path from the user, ensuring any surrounding whitespace is removed.

- Step 2: **Normalize the Path**
  - Use a method to standardize the path by collapsing any redundant segments, such as `./` or `../`, and resolving it into a clear format.

- Step 3: **Ensure Proper Format**
  - Check if the path begins with a forward slash (`/`). If it has multiple forward slashes at the start, reduce them to a single forward slash.

- Step 4: **Display Result**
  - Output the final normalized path to the user.

**Summary of Input and Output:**
- **Input:** A raw file path string from the user.
- **Output:** A cleaned and normalized file path with only a single leading forward slash, presented to the user.
