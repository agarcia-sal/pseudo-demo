**Pseudocode for the given code:**

1. **Start**  

2. **Define Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user or system.

3. **Process Input:**
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.
   - Normalize the file path by resolving any relative components (like ".." or ".") to create a standard path format.

4. **Adjust Path Format:**
   - If the normalized path starts with one or more forward slashes ("/"), replace these with a single forward slash. 

5. **Output Result:**
   - Display the modified file path to the user.

6. **End**  

**Summary of Functionality:**
- The program takes an input file path, normalizes it, and ensures that it starts with a single forward slash if it is a valid path that includes slashes. This is useful for standardizing paths in a system where path format consistency is important.
