Here is the pseudocode representation of the given code snippet:

```plaintext
START

// Read input from the user
SET userInput AS read from standard input
// Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the input
SET trimmedInput AS remove whitespace from userInput

// Normalize the path by eliminating redundant separators and up-level references
SET normalizedPath AS normalize the file path from trimmedInput

// Replace multiple leading slashes with a single leading slash
SET finalPath AS replace occurrences of multiple leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single leading slash

// Output the final normalized path
PRINT finalPath

END
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by indicating that we are reading input data from the standard input, which is clarified by describing it as user input.
  
2. **Trimming Whitespace:** It highlights that whitespace should be removed from the beginning and end of the input string.

3. **Path Normalization:** The process of normalizing the file path conveys clearly that we're simplifying the path by removing excess separators and any up-level directory references.

4. **Leading Slash Replacement:** The action of replacing multiple leading slashes emphasizes that it ensures the path starts with only one leading slash.

5. **Output:** Finally, the pseudocode concludes with the act of printing the processed path, clearly stating that this is the end of the operation.

This pseudocode retains the high-level logic of the original code while avoiding specific programming language syntax, ensuring clarity and comprehensibility.
