```
# Read a file path input from standard input
INPUT_PATH = READ input from standard input

# Normalize the file path by removing redundant separators
NORMALIZED_PATH = NORMALIZE the INPUT_PATH

# Replace any leading slashes with a single leading slash
CLEANED_PATH = SUBSTITUTE the beginning of NORMALIZED_PATH
                   with a single slash if it has multiple leading slashes

# Output the cleaned path
PRINT CLEANED_PATH
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** We read the input path from standard input.
2. **Normalization:** The path is normalized to ensure it uses the correct format.
3. **Cleaning Up:** Leading slashes are standardized to only one.
4. **Output:** The final cleaned path is printed. 

This pseudocode captures the essential logic and flow without delving into specific language syntax, aiming for clear and concise readability.
