```
FUNCTION normalizeAndPrintPath()
    // Read input from standard input and remove any leading/trailing whitespace
    SET inputPath TO read the entire input from the user

    // Normalize the file path to remove unnecessary components
    SET normalizedPath TO normalize the inputPath

    // Replace any leading slashes with a single slash
    SET finalPath TO replace any occurrences of multiple leading slashes with a single slash in normalizedPath

    // Output the final formatted path
    PRINT finalPath
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION normalize(inputPath)
    // Normalize the file path by converting it to a standard format
    // This could involve resolving any '..' or '.' references in the path
    RETURN the normalized version of inputPath
END FUNCTION
```

### Context and Explanation:
- The main purpose of the code is to read a file path from the standard input, normalize it by removing extraneous parts (like redundant slashes), and then print it in a clean format.
- The functionality is broken down into two main tasks: normalizing the path and formatting it to replace multiple slashes.
- The pseudocode structure and variable names aim to provide clarity on what each part of the code does without getting into specific programming language syntax.
