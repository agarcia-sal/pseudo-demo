### Explanation:
1. **Purpose:** The code processes a file path read from standard input, normalizes it, and reformats it by ensuring that there is a single leading slash.
  
2. **Variable Names:** Descriptive names like `inputPath`, `normalizedPath`, and `finalPath` clarify their roles.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** The pseudocode focuses on the function names and their high-level purpose without detailing implementation specifics.

4. **Control Structures:** The logical flow of operations is made clear, outlining how input is read, processed, and output.

5. **Input and Output:** The code reads from standard input and outputs a processed string representing the file path.

6. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode adheres to a clear structure highlighting function definitions and their internal logic.

7. **Natural Language:** The pseudocode uses simple terms like "normalize" and "remove" rather than technical jargon.

8. **Clarity Review:** Overall structure and language aim for clarity, making it accessible to individuals with varying programming backgrounds.

9. **Complexity Context:** The operations on strings are complex but represented simply in the pseudocode for easy understanding.

10. **Final Output Expectations:** The expected output is a well-formatted path string that begins with a single slash, following the processing rules defined in the original code.
