### Explanation of Components:

1. **Input and Output:** The code reads a file path from standard input, normalizes it, and prints the modified path. It handles leading slashes by ensuring only one is present at the start.

2. **Meaningful Names:** Functions and variables are named descriptively (e.g., `NormalizeAndPrintPath`, `normalizePath`, `replaceLeadingSlashes`) to clarify their purpose.

3. **Control Structures:** The flow of the function is outlined straightforwardly using high-level constructs, avoiding specific implementation details.

4. **Complexity Clarification:** The `normalizePath` function briefly mentions standard path normalization, implying additional logic would be needed to resolve path components.

This pseudocode captures the intent and functionality of the original code while being clear and approachable for readers unfamiliar with programming.
