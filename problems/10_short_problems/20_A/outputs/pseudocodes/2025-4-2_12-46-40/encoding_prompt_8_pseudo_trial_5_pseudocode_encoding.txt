### Purpose Summary
The main objective of this code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it to ensure a proper format, and then adjust the path by removing any leading slashes while preserving a single leading slash if applicable.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read the input from the user
    // This input represents a file path
    input_path = Read the entire input from the standard input and remove any extra spaces around it

    // Step 2: Normalize the file path
    // This ensures that the path is formatted correctly according to POSIX standards
    normalized_path = Normalize the input_path using standard path normalization rules

    // Step 3: Adjust the path
    // Replace any occurrence of multiple leading slashes with a single leading slash
    output_path = Replace all sequences of leading slashes in normalized_path with a single slash

    // Step 4: Print the result
    // Display the final adjusted path to the user
    Print output_path

END
```

### Comments for Clarity
- The function `Read` simulates reading from the standard input to gather user input.
- Normalization of the path includes actions like removing unnecessary components or resolving references like `..` or `.`.
- The operation of replacing leading slashes ensures the path starts with only one slash if it begins with multiple slashes.

### Example Structure
The above pseudocode emphasizes clarity with its structured approach, providing step-by-step logic that represents the code's functionality while utilizing clear, descriptive names for its variables and operations.
