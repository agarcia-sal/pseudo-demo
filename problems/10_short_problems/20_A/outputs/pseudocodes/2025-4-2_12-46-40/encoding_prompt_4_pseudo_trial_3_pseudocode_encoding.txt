```pseudocode
// Read input from standard input and normalize the file path
READ rawInput FROM standard input

// Normalize the file path to remove any redundant separators
normalizedPath = NORMALIZE PATH(rawInput)

// Use a regular expression to ensure the path starts with a single '/' if it contains any leading slashes
finalPath = REMOVE LEADING SLASHES FROM normalizedPath, KEEP ONLY ONE

// Output the final formatted file path
PRINT finalPath

// FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
FUNCTION NORMALIZE PATH(input):
    // Convert the input to a normalized form (e.g., resolve relative paths, remove unnecessary separators)
    RETURN normalized version of input

FUNCTION REMOVE LEADING SLASHES FROM(path, retainCount):
    // Replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    RETURN path with multiple leading slashes replaced by one slash
``` 

### Note:
- The pseudocode includes meaningful function and variable naming for clarity.
- Control structures such as functions are clearly indicated.
- The overall logic is captured without unnecessary detail, focusing on the major steps involved in the code.
