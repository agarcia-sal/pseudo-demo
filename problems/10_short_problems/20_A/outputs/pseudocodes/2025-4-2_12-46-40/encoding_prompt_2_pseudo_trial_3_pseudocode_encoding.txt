**Pseudocode**

1. **Input:** Read a string from the standard input, which represents a file path that may contain extra slashes at the beginning.

2. **Process:**
   - Normalize the input string to clean up any irregular path formatting. This may involve converting the input path into a standard form by removing unnecessary elements.
   - Search for any occurrence of one or more forward slashes at the beginning of the normalized path.
   - Replace these leading slashes with a single forward slash to ensure that the resulting path starts with exactly one forward slash.

3. **Output:** Display the modified path to the standard output. 

**Detailed Steps:**
- Read the input path and remove any extra spaces surrounding it.
- Normalize the path to handle different formatting cases and standardize its representation.
- Identify if the normalized path starts with multiple forward slashes.
- If multiple forward slashes are found at the start, replace them with a single forward slash.
- Print the cleaned-up path to the console. 

By following these steps, the final output will provide a well-formatted file path that adheres to the expected structure.
