```plaintext
// Read input from the standard input and normalize the path
function normalizePath() 
    // Read the input and remove extra spaces
    input_path = read input from standard input 
    normalized_path = normalize the input path

    // Replace any leading slashes with a single slash
    final_path = replace leading slashes in normalized_path with a single slash

    // Output the resulting normalized path
    print(final_path)
end function

// Call the function to execute
normalizePath()
``` 

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode captures the main operations: reading input, normalizing a file path, replacing leading slashes, and printing the final result.
- Meaningful function and variable names enhance readability.
- Details about specific libraries or syntax from a programming language are abstracted away to focus on the logic.
