**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it by removing unnecessary segments, and then print a simplified version of the path with leading slashes adjusted.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a string of text from standard input which represents a file path.
   - Remove any surrounding whitespace from the input.

2. **Normalize the File Path:**
   - Adjust the file path to remove redundant segments:
     - If the path starts with multiple slashes (e.g., "//"), replace them with a single slash ("/").
     - Use a method to ensure the path is in its simplest form according to the filesystem rules.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the modified file path to the output.

**Detailed Steps:**

- Initialize a variable **input_path** to store the file path read from standard input.
- Remove any extra spaces around **input_path**.
- Normalize **input_path**:
  - Use a function to convert the path into its correct form, ensuring it follows the standard format (e.g., normalizing any backslashes or removing trailing segments).
- Replace leading slashes within **input_path**:
  - Check if **input_path** starts with more than one slash.
  - If so, replace any sequence of slashes at the start with a single slash.
- Store the result in a variable **normalized_path**.
- Print **normalized_path** as the final output.

**Example Flow:**

- User inputs: "///my//folder//file.txt"
- Internal processing:
  - Stripped whitespace: "///my//folder//file.txt"
  - Normalization performed results in: "/my/folder/file.txt"
  - Leading slashes adjusted to: "/my/folder/file.txt"
- Final output: "/my/folder/file.txt"

This pseudocode provides a clear, high-level overview of the algorithm, maintaining the original logic while ensuring clarity and accessibility for readers.
