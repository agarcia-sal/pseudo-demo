// Pseudocode to normalize a file path from standard input

FUNCTION main
    // Read input path from standard input and trim whitespace
    INPUT_PATH = read from standard input
    NORMALIZED_PATH = normalize path(INPUT_PATH)
    
    // Print the normalized path
    OUTPUT NORMALIZED_PATH
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION normalize path(inputPath)
    // Normalize the path by removing redundant slashes
    TRIMMED_PATH = remove leading slashes from inputPath
    RETURN FINAL_PATH that starts with a single leading slash
END FUNCTION

// Helper function to remove leading slashes
FUNCTION remove leading slashes(path)
    WHILE path starts with '/'
        REMOVE the leading slash from path
    END WHILE
    RETURN path
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode outlines the key components and flow of the original code while abstracting away specific language syntax.
- The `main` function handles input and output operations, focusing on reading from standard input and printing the normalized path.
- The `normalize path` function is responsible for normalizing the input path, utilizing a helper function to manage slash removal.
- Descriptive names are used for clarity, ensuring that someone unfamiliar with the original code can understand the algorithm's purpose and structure.
