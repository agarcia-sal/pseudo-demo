**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it to ensure a standard format, and then clean up leading slashes from that path before outputting the result.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a file path from the user input.

2. **Normalize the Path:**
   - Convert the file path to a standard format by removing any unnecessary up-level references and resolving any relative references.

3. **Remove Leading Slashes:**
   - If the normalized path begins with one or more slashes, replace them with a single leading slash.

4. **Display Output:**
   - Output the cleaned-up file path.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Read the Input:**
   - Get the file path from the userâ€™s input.
   - Store this value in a variable called `inputPath`.

2. **Normalize the File Path:**
   - Create a variable `normalizedPath` and set it to the normalized version of `inputPath` using a normalization function.

3. **Clean Up Leading Slashes:**
   - If `normalizedPath` starts with one or more slashes:
     - Replace the beginning of `normalizedPath` with a single slash.
   - Store this cleaned path back in `normalizedPath`.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the value of `normalizedPath`.

### Summary of Control Structures:

- **Conditional Statement:** 
  - Check if the normalized path starts with one or more slashes.
  
- **Output Operation:**
  - Print the final result to the console.

This pseudocode abstracts the program's logic, breaks down its essential functions, and provides clear steps for understanding without requiring technical knowledge of specific programming languages or syntax.
