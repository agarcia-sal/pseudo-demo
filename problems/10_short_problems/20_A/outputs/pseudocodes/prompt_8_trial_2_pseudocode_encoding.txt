**Purpose:** The code reads a file path, normalizes it to remove redundant slashes and then prints the processed path.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Read Input:**
   - Read a line of text from standard input (e.g., the console or a file).
   - Store this input as a "file path".

3. **Normalize File Path:**
   - Convert the file path to a standard format to eliminate any unnecessary "." or ".." segments.
   - Adjust the file path such that multiple consecutive slashes (e.g., "///") are reduced to a single slash ("/").
   
4. **Prepare Output:**
   - Create a new version of the normalized file path where any leading slashes (slashes at the start) are replaced with a single slash.

5. **Display Result:**
   - Print the cleaned-up file path to the standard output (e.g., the console).

**Detailed Steps:**

- **Reading the File Path:**
  - Input: A string representing a file path (example: "///folder//subfolder/").
  
- **Normalizing the Path:**
  - Use a method to normalize the path:
    - Remove excess slashes.
    - This means that any sequence of slashes should be replaced with a single slash.
  
- **Cleaning Leading Slashes:**
  - If the normalized path starts with one or more slashes, replace them with just a single slash.

- **Outputting the Final File Path:**
  - Print the result to the console.

**Example:**
- Input: `"///folder//subfolder/"`
- Normalization Results in: `"/folder/subfolder/"`.
- Final Output printed: `"/folder/subfolder/"`.

**End Program** 

This structure captures the overall functionality of the original code while being easy to understand for a reader unfamiliar with programming specifics.
