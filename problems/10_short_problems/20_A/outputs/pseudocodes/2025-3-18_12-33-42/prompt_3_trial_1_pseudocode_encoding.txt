```pseudocode
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read input from standard input
    DEFINE inputString AS read input from standard input
    
    // Step 2: Normalize the input path string
    NORMALIZE inputString BY removing any redundant path elements
        // This operation cleans up the path, ensuring proper formatting
        SET normalizedPath AS normalized version of inputString
    
    // Step 3: Remove leading slashes
    // This ensures that there's at most one leading slash in the final output
    DEFINE finalPath AS replace leading slashes in normalizedPath WITH a single slash
    
    // Step 4: Output the final normalized path
    PRINT finalPath

END
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:** The pseudocode begins with reading the input, which is expected to be a string representing a file path.
   
2. **Normalizing the Path:** The normalization step removes unnecessary parts of the path (like `..` or duplicate slashes), making sure the path is properly formatted.

3. **Handling Leading Slashes:** The code further processes the normalized path to ensure that it has only one leading slash if present.

4. **Displaying Output:** Finally, the normalized path is printed.

This structure provides a clear flow of the logical steps, focusing on the intent while decluttering the specifics of programming syntax.
