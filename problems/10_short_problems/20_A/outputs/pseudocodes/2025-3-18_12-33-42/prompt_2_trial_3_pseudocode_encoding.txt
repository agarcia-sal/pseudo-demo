**Pseudocode:**

**Begin Program**

**Input:**
- Read a line of text from standard input. This text represents a file path that may contain extra slashes.

**Process:**
1. Normalize the file path:
   - Take the input text and remove any leading and trailing spaces.
   - Apply a normalization process to the file path to ensure that it follows the correct format for a file system. This involves collapsing redundant slashes and resolving any relative path elements.

2. Clean the beginning of the path:
   - Search the normalized file path for one or more consecutive leading slashes at the start of the string. 
   - Replace any occurrences of these leading slashes with a single slash. This ensures that the path begins correctly with just one slash.

**Output:**
- Print the resulting cleaned and normalized file path to the standard output.

**End Program**
