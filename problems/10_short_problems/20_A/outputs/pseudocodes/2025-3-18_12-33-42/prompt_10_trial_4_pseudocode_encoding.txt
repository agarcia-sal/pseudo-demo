Here is the pseudocode following the instructed steps:

1. **Identify the Main Components:**
   - Import necessary modules (`posixpath` for path manipulation and `sys` for standard input).
   - Use `re` for regular expression operations.
   - Read input from standard input, normalize the path, and then print a modified version of the path.

2. **Break Down Complex Elements:**
   - Normalize the path to handle any irregularities in the input (e.g., redundant separators).
   - Remove leading slashes from the normalized path, ensuring only a single leading slash remains.

3. **State Assumptions Clearly:**
   - Assume that the input is a valid string representing a file path.
   - Assume that the input may contain leading slashes that need to be corrected.

4. **Maintain Clarity and Readability:**
   - Use descriptive variable names like `inputPath` and `normalizedPath`.
   
5. **Choose Appropriate Verb Tenses:**
   - Utilize present tense for actions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Import necessary modules (assumed)
    IMPORT posixpath
    IMPORT sys
    IMPORT re

    // Read input from standard input and store it in a variable
    SET inputPath TO sys.stdin.read().strip()

    // Normalize the file path to handle irregularities
    SET normalizedPath TO posixpath.normpath(inputPath)

    // Replace leading slashes with a single leading slash
    SET finalPath TO re.sub('^/+', '/', normalizedPath)

    // Print the modified path
    PRINT finalPath

END
``` 

This pseudocode emphasizes a structured way of approaching the problem while maintaining clear logic and readability.
