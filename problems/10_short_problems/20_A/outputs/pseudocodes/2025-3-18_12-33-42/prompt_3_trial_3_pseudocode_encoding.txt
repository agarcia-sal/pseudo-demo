**Pseudocode: Normalize File Path**

**Inputs:**
- Read a file path from standard input.

**Output:**
- Print the normalized file path.

**Steps:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Capture the input path string from standard input.
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.

2. **Normalize Path:**
   - Use a method to normalize the path. This should adjust the format of the path according to standard filesystem conventions, such as:
     - Removing duplicate or unnecessary slashes (e.g., converting "///" to "/").
     - Adjusting relative path components (e.g., resolving ".." and "." if applicable).

3. **Adjust Leading Slashes:**
   - Search the normalized path for occurrences of one or more leading slashes.
   - Replace occurrences of leading slashes with a single leading slash to ensure the path starts correctly.

4. **Output Result:**
   - Print the modified path.

**Example of Logic in Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION NormalizeFilePath:
    INPUT: string inputPath
    OUTPUT: string normalizedPath

    SET trimmedPath = TRIM(inputPath)              // Remove whitespace from the input
    SET normalizedPath = NORMALIZE(trimmedPath)    // Normalize the path using a standard method
    SET finalPath = SUBSTITUTE_LEADING_SLASHES(normalizedPath) // Replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    PRINT finalPath                                 // Output the final normalized path

END FUNCTION
```

In this pseudocode, we describe the overall goal of normalizing a file path while clarifying the steps without resorting to programming language-specific syntax. The processes of reading, normalization, and outputting are distinctly laid out for better understanding.
