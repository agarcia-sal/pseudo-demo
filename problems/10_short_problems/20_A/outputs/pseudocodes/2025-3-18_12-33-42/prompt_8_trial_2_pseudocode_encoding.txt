**Purpose**: The code reads a file path from the standard input, normalizes it by removing redundant slashes, and then prints the cleaned-up path.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Define the Main Functionality**:
   - Read a file path from the standard input.
   - Normalize the file path by removing unnecessary slashes at the beginning and ensuring a standard format.
   - Output the cleaned file path.

2. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Read the file path as a string from the user input.
   - **Step 2**: Normalize the file path:
     - Eliminate any redundant leading slashes so that the path starts with a single slash if it exists.
   - **Step 3**: Print the normalized file path to the standard output.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Read input
    filePath = Read input from user

    // Step 2: Normalize the file path
    normalizedPath = Normalize filePath by removing redundant leading slashes

    // Step 3: Output the result
    Print normalizedPath
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION Normalize(filePath)
    // Remove additional leading slashes
    IF filePath starts with more than 1 slash THEN
        RETURN filePath starting with a single slash
    ELSE
        RETURN filePath
END FUNCTION
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The `Normalize` function is designed to ensure that the output always complies with the expected format for file paths, making it easier for further operations or for other systems to handle.
- This approach abstracts away the complexities of string manipulation by using clear functional blocks, which can be easily followed or adapted without requiring familiarity with specific programming language syntax.
