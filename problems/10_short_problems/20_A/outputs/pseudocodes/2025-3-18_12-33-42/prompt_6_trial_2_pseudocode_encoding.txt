**Pseudocode for Normalizing File Paths**

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:
   - Import modules for handling file path operations and regular expressions.

2. **Read Input**:
   - Read the entire input from the standard input.
   - Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.

3. **Normalize the File Path**:
   - Apply a function to normalize the structure of the file path:
     - Convert the path to a standard format, handling slashes appropriately.

4. **Remove Extra Leading Slashes**:
   - Replace any sequence of leading slashes at the start of the normalized path with a single slash.

5. **Output Result**:
   - Print the final normalized and cleaned file path.

### Pseudocode:

```plaintext
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // IMPORT necessary modules for path and regex handling
    IMPORT posixpath
    IMPORT sys
    IMPORT re

    FUNCTION NormalizeFilePath
        // Read the entire input from the standard input
        DECLARE rawPath AS STRING
        rawPath = Read input from standard input
        
        // Trim leading and trailing whitespace
        DECLARE trimmedPath AS STRING
        trimmedPath = Remove leading and trailing whitespace from rawPath
        
        // Normalize the path using posixpath
        DECLARE normalizedPath AS STRING
        normalizedPath = Normalize the path structure using posixpath
        
        // Replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash
        DECLARE cleanedPath AS STRING
        cleanedPath = Replace any sequence of leading slashes with a single slash in normalizedPath
        
        // Output the final cleaned path
        Print cleanedPath
    END FUNCTION

END PROGRAM
```

### Summary of Main Operations:
- The pseudocode describes a program that reads a file path from input, normalizes it to a standard format, and cleans up excessive leading slashes before displaying the final result. Each step is clearly articulated for ease of understanding.
