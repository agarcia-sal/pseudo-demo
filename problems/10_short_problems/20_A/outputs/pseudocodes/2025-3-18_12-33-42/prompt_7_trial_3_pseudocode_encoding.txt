```  
FUNCTION processInputPath()
    // Read input from standard input
    INITIALIZE inputPath AS the result of reading from standard input
    // Normalize the path to remove redundant separators and up-level references
    SET normalizedPath AS normalizePath(inputPath)
    // Remove leading slashes from the normalized path, replacing them with a single leading slash
    SET finalPath AS removeLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)
    // Print the final cleaned path
    OUTPUT finalPath
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION normalizePath(path)
    // Normalize the path based on POSIX rules
    RETURN the normalized version of the input path
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION removeLeadingSlashes(path)
    // Replace any leading slashes in the path with a single slash
    RETURN the path after ensuring it starts with a single '/', removing excessive leading slashes
END FUNCTION
```

### Input and Output Expectations:
- **Input:** A string representing a file path read from standard input.
- **Output:** A cleaned and normalized version of the file path that ensures a single leading slash and resolves any redundant separators.

### Explanation of Logic:
1. **Reading Input:** The function begins by reading a file path from standard input.
2. **Normalization:** It normalizes the path to consolidate any redundant slashes or directory references.
3. **Cleaning the Path:** It ensures that the result starts with a single leading slash, removing any additional slashes at the beginning.
4. **Output:** Finally, it outputs the cleaned and properly formatted file path.
