**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to normalize a file path read from the input and format it by replacing leading slashes with a single slash.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a file path from standard input.
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input.

2. **Normalize the Path:**
   - Use a method to convert the file path to its standard form, ensuring any redundant separators are handled appropriately.

3. **Replace Leading Slashes:**
   - If the normalized path starts with one or more slashes, change it to start with a single slash.

4. **Display the Result:**
   - Print the updated file path.

**Detailed Steps:**

- Step 1: 
    - Define a variable `inputPath` to hold the input read from the user.
    - Use a function to read from the standard input and store the result in `inputPath`.
    - Trim any excess whitespace from `inputPath`.

- Step 2:
    - Define a variable `normalizedPath` to store the processed file path.
    - Apply the normalization function to `inputPath` to convert it into standard format, where all redundant path elements are consolidated.

- Step 3:
    - Check if `normalizedPath` begins with one or more slashes.
    - If it does, replace the leading slashes in `normalizedPath` with a single slash.

- Step 4:
    - Print the final version of `normalizedPath` to the output.

This structure ensures clarity in the overall logic of the program while abstracting details specific to programming syntax, thus making it accessible to a wider audience.
