Sure! Below is a high-level pseudocode implementation based on the provided Python code. The goal of the code is to normalize a given file path while ensuring that any leading slashes are reduced to a single slash.

```plaintext
FUNCTION normalizeFilePath()
    // Read input from standard input (keyboard or other source)
    READ inputPath FROM standard input
    
    // Normalize the file path by removing redundant separators
    SET normalizedPath TO normalizePath(inputPath)
    
    // Remove leading slashes and replace them with a single slash if present
    SET finalPath TO replaceLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)
    
    // Print the resulting file path
    PRINT finalPath
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION normalizePath(inputPath)
    // Normalize the input path format to remove redundant path separators
    RETURN result of normalizing inputPath
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION replaceLeadingSlashes(path)
    // Replace any occurrence of multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    RETURN result of removing leading slashes from path and replacing with single slash
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **Function Structure:** The overall process is encapsulated in a `normalizeFilePath` function, which manages reading the input, normalizing the path, and printing the result.
  
2. **Normalize Path:** A separate function `normalizePath` is defined to handle the normalization of the input path.

3. **Replace Leading Slashes:** Another function `replaceLeadingSlashes` is defined to specifically address the task of reducing multiple leading slashes to a single one.

4. **Input and Output:** The pseudocode explains that the input is read from the standard input and the normalized output is printed directly.

5. **Clarity and Flow:** Control structures like functions are used to improve organization and clarity, making the pseudocode easily digestible and understandable for users with various programming backgrounds.
