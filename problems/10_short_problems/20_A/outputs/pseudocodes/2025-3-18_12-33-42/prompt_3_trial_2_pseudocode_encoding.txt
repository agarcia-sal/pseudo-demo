Here's a structured pseudocode representation of the provided code snippet that maintains clarity while capturing the logical flow:

```
BEGIN MAIN

    // Step 1: Read input from standard input, ensuring there are no leading or trailing spaces
    SET inputString TO READ from standard input and TRIM spaces

    // Step 2: Normalize the path to ensure it uses the correct format for POSIX file paths
    SET normalizedPath TO NORMALIZE the inputString to a POSIX path

    // Step 3: Remove any leading slashes from the normalized path
    // Replace every sequence of one or more leading slashes with a single slash
    SET cleanedPath TO REPLACE leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single slash

    // Step 4: Output the cleaned path
    PRINT cleanedPath

END MAIN
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The first step is to read an input string, stripping any unnecessary spaces to clean up the input.
2. **Normalization:** The next step normalizes the path to conform to POSIX standards, which simplifies the representation of file paths (e.g., converting ".." and "." segments).
3. **Clean-Up:** After normalization, leading slashes from the path are consolidated into one single leading slash to maintain a standard appearance.
4. **Output:** Finally, the cleaned path is printed as the result.

This pseudocode provides a clear understanding of the operations performed in the original code without delving into specific programming syntax.
