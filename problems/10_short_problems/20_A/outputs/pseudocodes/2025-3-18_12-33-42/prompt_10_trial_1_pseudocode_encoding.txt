**Pseudocode: Normalize and Clean File Path Input**

1. **Start:**
   Begin the execution of the program.

2. **Input Handling:**
   Read the input from the standard input source and store it in a variable `inputString`.

3. **Process Input:**
   - **Remove Leading/Trailing Whitespaces:** 
     Set variable `trimmedPath` to the result of removing any leading or trailing white spaces from `inputString`.
   - **Normalize File Path:**
     Set variable `normalizedPath` to the result of normalizing `trimmedPath` to a standard format.

4. **Clean Path:**
   - **Substitute Leading Slashes:**
     Set variable `cleanedPath` to the result of replacing multiple leading slashes (if present) in `normalizedPath` with a single slash `/`.

5. **Output Result:**
   Print `cleanedPath` as the final output.

6. **End:**
   Complete the execution of the program.

**Assumptions:**
- `inputString` can be a file path provided by the user.
- The normalization process handles the specific requirements of file paths (e.g., converting separators).
- The cleaning process is concerned only with leading slashes and not other potential errors in the path.

**Note:**
- "Normalize" means converting the input path into a standard format, making it easier to work with.
- The `print` function is used solely for outputting the final cleaned path.
