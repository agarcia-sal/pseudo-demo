**Summary of Purpose:**
The main goal of this code is to normalize a given file path by removing redundant components, ensuring it starts with a single forward slash.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Define Function to Normalize Path**
   - **Input:** A string representing a file path (read from standard input).
   - **Output:** A normalized file path that begins with one forward slash.

3. **Read Input:**
   - Read the entire input from the user.
   - Remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the input string.

4. **Normalize the Path:**
   - Convert the input path into a standardized format (e.g., resolving segments to remove redundant slashes and dots).
   - Replace any instances of multiple leading slashes with a single leading slash.

5. **Generate Output:**
   - Print the normalized file path.

**Detailed Steps:**

```
FUNCTION NormalizePath:
    START
        // Read the file path input from the user
        filePath = Read entire input from standard input

        // Trim whitespace from the edges of the input string
        trimmedPath = Remove leading and trailing whitespace from filePath

        // Normalize the path
        normalizedPath = Normalize the path using standard normalization rules
        
        // Ensure path starts with a single forward slash
        finalPath = Replace multiple leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single slash

        // Output the final normalized path
        PRINT finalPath
    END
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The function `NormalizePath` takes a string input representing the file path, cleans it up, and ensures that it is correctly formatted for further use.
- Whitespace trimming is essential to avoid errors from unexpected leading or trailing spaces.
- Path normalization handles redundant slashes and ensures a consistent format that can be utilized in other file system operations. 

**Example Structures:**
- Utilizing clear function names such as `NormalizePath` makes it understandable at a glance.
- Using descriptive variable names like `filePath`, `trimmedPath`, `normalizedPath`, and `finalPath` conveys their purpose effectively. 

**Iterate for Improvement:**
- Review the steps to ensure logical progression and clarity, making adjustments to enhance readability where necessary.
