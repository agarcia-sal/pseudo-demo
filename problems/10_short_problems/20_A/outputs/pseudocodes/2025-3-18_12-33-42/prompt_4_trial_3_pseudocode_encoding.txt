```
# Read input from standard input
inputPath = read from standard input

# Normalize the input path to remove any redundant separators
normalizedPath = normalize the inputPath

# Replace any leading slashes in the normalized path with a single slash
finalPath = replace leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single slash

# Output the final cleaned path
output finalPath
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **Input handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading input, which would come from the standard input.
2. **Normalization**: The path normalization is expressed simply as a function that handles redundant separators.
3. **Leading Slashes**: The pseudocode clearly states that leading slashes should be replaced with a single slash.
4. **Output**: Finally, the cleaned path is printed or output. 

This maintains the logic while being concise and easy to understand.
