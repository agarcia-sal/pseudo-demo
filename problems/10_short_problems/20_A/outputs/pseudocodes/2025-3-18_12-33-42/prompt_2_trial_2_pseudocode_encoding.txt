**Pseudocode:**

1. **Begin Main Program**  
   - Define a variable to store a normalized file path.

2. **Input Handling**  
   - Read input from the user via standard input, which is expected to be a file path string.
   - Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string.

3. **Normalize Path**  
   - Use a method to convert the input path to its canonical form, resolving any relative components (like '..', '.', etc.) and ensuring the path is in a standard format.

4. **Remove Leading Slashes**  
   - Replace any sequence of leading slashes at the beginning of the normalized path with a single slash.

5. **Output Final Path**  
   - Display the transformed file path as the final output of the program.

6. **End Main Program**
