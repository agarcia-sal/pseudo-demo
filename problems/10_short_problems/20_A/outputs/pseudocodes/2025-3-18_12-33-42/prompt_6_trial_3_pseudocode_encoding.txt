Here's a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided Python code:

```
BEGIN

    // Read input from the standard input
    READ inputString FROM standard input

    // Normalize the path by removing any redundant separators
    normalizedPath = NormalizePath(inputString)
    
    // Replace any leading slashes with a single slash
    finalOutput = ReplaceLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)

    // Print the final output
    PRINT finalOutput

END


FUNCTION NormalizePath(path)
    // This function normalizes the path by removing redundant separators
    RETURN normalized path using existing functionality

END FUNCTION


FUNCTION ReplaceLeadingSlashes(path)
    // This function ensures that the path starts with a single slash
    IF path starts with two or more slashes THEN
        REPLACE leading slashes with a single slash
    ENDIF
    RETURN modified path

END FUNCTION
```

### Summary of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling**: The code starts by reading a string from the standard input.
2. **Normalization**: It normalizes the path, which involves cleaning up redundant separators.
3. **Leading Slash Replacement**: It ensures that the processed path begins with just one leading slash, regardless of how many were in the original input.
4. **Output**: Finally, it outputs the cleaned and formatted path. 

This pseudocode uses descriptive functions and variable names to clearly convey the logic and flow of the original code while remaining accessible and easy to understand.
