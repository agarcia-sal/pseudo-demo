**Purpose:** The primary goal of the code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it by removing any redundant or unnecessary path segments, and then output a cleaned-up version of that path.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read a path input from the user
    INPUT rawPath FROM standardInput
    
    // Step 2: Normalize the file path
    normalizedPath = NormalizePath(rawPath)
    
    // Step 3: Clean up the path by replacing multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    cleanedPath = CleanLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)
    
    // Step 4: Output the cleaned path
    OUTPUT cleanedPath TO standardOutput

END


// Function to remove redundant elements and normalize the path
FUNCTION NormalizePath(inputPath)
    // Use the standard library to normalize the path
    RETURN normalizedPath FROM pathLibrary.Normalize(inputPath)
END FUNCTION


// Function to replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash
FUNCTION CleanLeadingSlashes(path)
    // Use a regular expression to substitute one or more leading slashes with a single slash
    RETURN UpdateLeadingSlashes(path)
END FUNCTION
```

**Comments for Clarity:**

1. **Input Handling:** The path is read directly from the standard input, which means it expects the user or another program to provide a path.
2. **Normalization Process:** The function `NormalizePath` simplifies the path by removing redundancies and correcting any inconsistencies.
3. **Leading Slashes Cleanup:** The function `CleanLeadingSlashes` ensures that regardless of how many slashes are present at the start of the path, only one remains.
4. **Outputting the Result:** The cleaned path is printed as the final step, allowing the user to see the normalized path.

**Iteration for Improvement:** The pseudocode clearly outlines the operations without relying on programming language syntax. The functions are broken down logically, and the naming conventions enhance readability, ensuring that even readers with minimal coding experience can understand the program's flow.
