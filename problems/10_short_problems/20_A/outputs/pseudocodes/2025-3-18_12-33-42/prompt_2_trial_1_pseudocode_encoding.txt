**Pseudocode**

**Input:** Read a string representing a file path from the standard input.

1. **Normalize the File Path:**
   - Create a variable named `rawFilePath` and assign it the value of the input string, ensuring to remove any leading and trailing whitespace.
   - Create a variable named `normalizedFilePath` and assign it the normalized version of `rawFilePath`. Normalization is performed by converting any platform-specific path representations to a standard format.

2. **Remove Leading Slashes:**
   - Create a variable named `finalFilePath`.
   - Using a regular expression, revise `normalizedFilePath` to remove any leading slashes (multiple slashes at the beginning of the string) and replace them with a single slash.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the value of `finalFilePath` as the final, processed file path.

**Output:** The final, clean file path with a standard format and a single leading slash if applicable.
