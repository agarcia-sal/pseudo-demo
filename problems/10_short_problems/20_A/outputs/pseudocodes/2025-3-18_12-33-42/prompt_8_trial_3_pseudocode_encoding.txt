### Purpose
The primary goal of this code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it to ensure it follows a consistent format, and then modify the path by removing any leading slashes before outputting the result.

### Pseudocode

1. **Start Program**

2. **Read Input**
   - Obtain a file path from the user's input via standard input.
   - Remove any unnecessary leading or trailing whitespace from the input.

3. **Normalize File Path**
   - Use a method to standardize the format of the file path, ensuring that it properly represents directory structures. For instance, convert any mixed separators to a standard format.

4. **Remove Leading Slashes**
   - Use a regular expression to search for one or more leading slashes at the beginning of the normalized file path.
   - Replace the leading slashes with a single slash.

5. **Output Result**
   - Print the modified file path to the standard output.

### Detailed Steps
```plaintext
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Step 1: Read the input path from standard input
    INPUT file_path FROM standard input
    REMOVE leading and trailing whitespace FROM file_path

    // Step 2: Normalize the path
    normalized_path = normalize(file_path)

    // Step 3: Remove any leading slashes
    // Check for one or more leading '/' and replace with a single '/'
    modified_path = replaceLeadingSlashes(normalized_path)

    // Step 4: Output the modified path
    PRINT modified_path

END PROGRAM
```

### Annotations
- **normalize(file_path)**: This function takes the input path and returns a standard format (e.g., replacing backslashes with forward slashes).
- **replaceLeadingSlashes(normalized_path)**: This function uses a regular expression to identify and replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash, ensuring the output is tidy.

### Example Structures
- This pseudocode mirrors high-level logic similar to these control structures:
  - A sequence of operations (steps) from start to finish.
  - Use of functions to abstract complex operations into understandable components.

### Review
The pseudocode maintains logical flow and accurately represents the original code's intention while ensuring clarity for readers who may not be familiar with programming syntax.
