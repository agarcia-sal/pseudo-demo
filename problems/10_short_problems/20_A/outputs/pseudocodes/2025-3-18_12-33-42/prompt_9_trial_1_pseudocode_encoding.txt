**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to read a file path from standard input, normalize it to a manageable format, and then clean up any leading slashes.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Receive a file path as input from the user or system.
   - Store this input as a string in a variable called `inputPath`.

2. **Normalize the File Path:**
   - Use a method to normalize the `inputPath` by transforming it into a standard format.
   - Store the normalized path in a variable named `normalizedPath`.

3. **Remove Leading Slashes:**
   - Create a new string called `cleanedPath` that will contain only the leading slash if the `normalizedPath` starts with one.
   - Replace any series of leading slashes in `normalizedPath` with a single leading slash.
   - Store this result in `cleanedPath`.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Display the `cleanedPath` to the user or system.

**Detailed Steps:**

- Read a string input from the user that represents a file path.
- Normalize the file path to eliminate any unnecessary or irregular components, such as redundant slashes or directory indicators.
- Check if the normalized path begins with one or more slashes. If it does, replace those leading slashes with just one.
- Print the resulting cleaned-up file path to the output.

**Final Review:** This pseudocode represents the logic of the original code effectively, maintaining clarity while ensuring that each significant operation is easily understandable. The names for variables and steps reflect their purposes without using technical jargon, making the process accessible to a broader audience.
