Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided code, following the guidelines outlined:

```
FUNCTION NormalizeFilePathFromInput()
    // Read the entire input from the standard input stream
    SET inputPath TO Read input from the standard input

    // Normalize the input path by removing redundant path separators
    SET normalizedPath TO Normalize the input path (remove redundant separators)

    // Adjust the normalized path to ensure it does not start with multiple leading slashes
    SET finalPath TO Replace leading slashes with a single slash in normalizedPath

    // Output the final normalized path
    OUTPUT finalPath
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION Normalize(inputPath)
    // This function applies normalization to the input path
    // by converting backslashes to slashes and removing redundant separators
    RETURN normalized path using file system rules
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Purpose:** The main function, `NormalizeFilePathFromInput`, reads a file path from input, normalizes it by removing redundant separators, and outputs a properly formatted path.
   
2. **Reading Input:** The pseudocode states the action of reading input from the standard input.

3. **Path Normalization:** It specifies the normalization of the path and hints at the underlying implementation, such as adjusting path separators and cleaning up the path.

4. **Output:** Clearly indicates that the function will output the final normalized path. 

5. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode adheres to a structured format, making it easy to follow and understand.

6. **High-Level Abstraction:** The logic of the operations is presented without delving into specific programming constructs, maintaining a high-level overview suitable for readers with varying levels of experience in programming.
