**Purpose:** The code reads a file path from standard input, normalizes it by eliminating redundant slashes, and then outputs the cleaned path.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Read the input path from the user
    INPUT rawPath FROM standard input
   
    // Step 2: Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input
    trimmedPath = TRIM(rawPath)
    
    // Step 3: Normalize the path to remove any redundant slashes
    // This will also convert any backslashes to forward slashes for consistency
    normalizedPath = NORMALIZE_PATH(trimmedPath)
    
    // Step 4: Substitute the beginning of the path if it starts with multiple slashes
    // This converts occurrences of one or more leading slashes to a single leading slash
    cleanedPath = SUBSTITUTE_LEADING_SLASHES(normalizedPath)

    // Step 5: Output the final cleaned path
    PRINT cleanedPath
END

// Helper Functions

FUNCTION NORMALIZE_PATH(path)
    // Replace backslashes with forward slashes
    RETURN REPLACE_BACKSLASHES_WITH_FORWARD(path)

FUNCTION SUBSTITUTE_LEADING_SLASHES(path)
    // Replace occurrences of one or more leading slashes with a single leading slash
    RETURN REPLACE_REGEX(path, '^/+','/')
```

**Comments:**
- `TRIM(rawPath)` ensures that any whitespace around the input path is removed.
- `NORMALIZE_PATH(path)` takes care of converting the path into a standard format, addressing filesystem differences.
- `SUBSTITUTE_LEADING_SLASHES(path)` uses a regular expression to ensure only one leading slash is used, if any.

**Additional Notes:**
- This pseudocode uses clear function names and comments to help readers understand underlying logic without needing programming expertise.
- The pseudocode structure promotes clarity by separating concerns, outlining how to manipulate the path step by step.
