**Pseudocode:**

BEGIN

    // Import necessary libraries for file path manipulation and regular expression functionality
    IMPORT path manipulation library
    IMPORT regular expression library
    
    // Read input from the standard input
    SET inputString AS read entire input from standard input
    // Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the input
    SET trimmedInputString AS remove whitespace from the beginning and end of inputString
    
    // Normalize the file path to a standard format
    SET normalizedPath AS normalize path using path manipulation library, with input being trimmedInputString
    
    // Replace any occurrences of multiple leading slashes with a single leading slash
    SET cleanedPath AS replace occurrences of one or more leading slashes at the start of normalizedPath with a single '/'
    
    // Output the final cleaned and normalized file path
    PRINT cleanedPath

END
