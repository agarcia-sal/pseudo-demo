Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that captures the intent and flow of the provided code snippet, while maintaining clarity and structure:

```
BEGIN

    // Read input from standard input, which is expected to be a path string
    SET inputPath TO getInputFromStandardInput()

    // Normalize the input path to remove any redundant separators and up-level references
    SET normalizedPath TO normalizePath(inputPath)

    // Remove leading slashes from the normalized path
    SET cleanedPath TO removeLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)

    // Output the cleaned path
    PRINT cleanedPath

END


FUNCTION getInputFromStandardInput()
    // Read all input from standard input, and trim any leading or trailing whitespace
    RETURN readInput().strip()
END FUNCTION


FUNCTION normalizePath(path)
    // Use a library function to normalize the path
    RETURN normalizePathUsingLibrary(path)
END FUNCTION


FUNCTION removeLeadingSlashes(path)
    // Use a regular expression to replace any sequence of leading slashes with a single slash
    RETURN replaceLeadingSlashesWithSingleSlash(path)
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts by reading the input path from the standard input which is expected to be a string representing a file path. 

2. **Path Normalization:** It then normalizes this path using a function that utilizes built-in library methods to handle any irregularities present in the path structure.

3. **Cleaning Up the Path:** After normalization, it removes leading slashes from the path to ensure that the output conforms to specific formatting rules.

4. **Output the Result:** Finally, the cleaned and normalized path is printed as the output.

Each function is defined to encapsulate specific tasks, making it easy to understand the flow of data and the purpose of each operation without diving into syntactical details of a programming language.
