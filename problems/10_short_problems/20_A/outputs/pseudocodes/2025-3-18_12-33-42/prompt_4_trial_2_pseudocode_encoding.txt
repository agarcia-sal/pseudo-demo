```
# Pseudocode to normalize a file path and ensure it starts with a single slash

# Read input from standard input
input_path = read entire input from standard input

# Normalize the file path
normalized_path = remove unnecessary path separators from input_path

# Ensure the path starts with a single slash
if normalized_path starts with multiple slashes:
    normalized_path = replace with single slash

# Output the final normalized path
print(normalized_path)

# Function definitions:
# - read entire input from standard input: reads all text input until EOF
# - remove unnecessary path separators from input: replaces any '//' with '/' and trims leading/trailing separators
# - replace with single slash: adjusts the beginning of the path to ensure only one leading '/'
