**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Requirement:**
   - Read a line of text from standard input, which represents a file path.

2. **Process the Input:**
   - Normalize the file path to a standard format by removing any unnecessary components (like redundant or trailing slashes).

3. **Clean the File Path:**
   - Ensure that the normalized file path does not start with multiple forward slashes.
   - Replace any occurrence of one or more forward slashes at the beginning of the path with a single forward slash.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Display the modified file path as the final output.

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
- Start by reading the file path input from the user.
- Normalize the input path, which could involve adjusting the format to ensure consistency.
- Check if the normalized path begins with more than one forward slash.
   - If it does, replace all but the first forward slash with a single forward slash.
- Finally, output the cleaned and formatted file path to the user.
