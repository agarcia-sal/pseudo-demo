Hereâ€™s the high-level pseudocode based on the provided code, following the instructions you've outlined:

```
FUNCTION processInputPath()
    INITIALIZE inputPath AS STRING
    INITIALIZE normalizedPath AS STRING
    
    // Read input from the standard input and trim whitespace
    inputPath = READ input from standard input
    
    // Normalize the input path to eliminate redundant separators and up-level references
    normalizedPath = NORMALIZE the inputPath to a standard format

    // Replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    normalizedPath = SUBSTITUTE leading slashes with a single slash in normalizedPath
    
    // Output the final processed path
    PRINT normalizedPath
END FUNCTION
```

### Context and Explanation:
1. **Purpose:** The code reads a file path from standard input, normalizes it, and cleans up excessive leading slashes before printing it.
  
2. **Meaningful Names:** The function `processInputPath()` clearly indicates the purpose of handling input paths. Variables like `inputPath` and `normalizedPath` help clarify what they represent.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** The pseudocode summarizes the primary operations (reading input, normalizing the path, substituting slashes, and printing the output) without getting into implementation specifics like using modules or functions from libraries.

4. **Control Structures:** The pseudocode does not involve complex loops or conditionals but clearly outlines processes in sequence.

5. **Input and Output:** Specifies the input is read from standard input and mentions the output will be the processed path.

6. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode follows a consistent structure with clear indentation to enhance readability.

7. **Natural Language:** Actions are articulated in simple terms to make the pseudocode accessible to a broad audience.

8. **Clarity Review:** The pseudocode effectively captures the logic of the original code in a clear and structured manner.

9. **Complexity Context:** Although the operations are straightforward, they involve string manipulation which might require further explanation in a more advanced context.

### Final Output Expectations:
This pseudocode presents a coherent representation of the original code, detailing its intent and operations in an understandable format.
