**Objective:** The purpose of this code is to read a path from standard input, normalize it to a standard format, and then output the corrected version of the path.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION NormalizeFilePath:
    // Step 1: Read input from the user
    INPUT rawPath FROM standard input

    // Step 2: Normalize the input path
    normalizedPath = NormalizePath(rawPath)

    // Step 3: Clean up the normalized path by ensuring it does not start with multiple slashes
    cleanedPath = RemoveLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)

    // Step 4: Output the final cleaned path
    PRINT cleanedPath


FUNCTION NormalizePath(path):
    // Replace any backslashes with forward slashes
    RETURN ReplaceBackslashesWithForwardslashes(path) 


FUNCTION RemoveLeadingSlashes(path):
    // Use a regular expression to replace any occurrences of multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    RETURN ReplaceMultipleLeadingSlashesWithSingleSlash(path)


FUNCTION ReplaceBackslashesWithForwardslashes(path):
    // This function takes a path and replaces all backslashes with forward slashes
    RETURN path with backslashes replaced by forward slashes


FUNCTION ReplaceMultipleLeadingSlashesWithSingleSlash(path):
    // This function takes a path and uses a regular expression to replace any leading slashes
    // that appear more than once at the beginning of the string with just one leading slash
    RETURN path with leading slashes cleaned up
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **NormalizeFilePath** serves as the main function, orchestrating the reading, normalizing, cleaning, and final output of the file path.
2. The **NormalizePath** function focuses on transforming the path format to ensure it uses a consistent style (forward slashes).
3. The **RemoveLeadingSlashes** function handles any extra slashes at the beginning of the path string.
4. Each helper function is clearly named to indicate its specific task, making the overall process easy to follow.

### Comments:
- Each function is modularized for clarity and reusability.
- The normalization and cleaning processes are divided for easier understanding, allowing someone unfamiliar with the original code to grasp its functionality.
