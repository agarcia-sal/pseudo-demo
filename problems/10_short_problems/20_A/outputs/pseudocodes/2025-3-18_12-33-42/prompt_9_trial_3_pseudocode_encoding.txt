### Purpose
The goal of this algorithm is to normalize a file path by cleaning up any redundant slashes at the beginning of the path before displaying the cleaned version.

### Pseudocode

1. **Read Input:**
   - Receive a file path as input from the user, ensuring any extraneous spaces at the beginning or end are removed.

2. **Normalize the File Path:**
   - Convert the file path to a standard format by removing any redundant path separators.

3. **Remove Leading Slashes:**
   - If the normalized file path begins with one or more slashes, replace this with a single slash.

4. **Display Output:**
   - Print the cleaned file path.

### Detailed Steps in Pseudocode

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read the input file path
    SET rawFilePath TO read user input and trim spaces

    // Step 2: Normalize the file path
    SET normalizedPath TO normalize the file path using standard normalization method

    // Step 3: Remove leading slashes
    IF normalizedPath starts with one or more slashes THEN
        SET cleanedPath TO replace leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single slash
    ELSE
        SET cleanedPath TO normalizedPath
    
    // Step 4: Display the cleaned file path
    print cleanedPath

END
```

### Summary of Key Components:
- **Input Handling:** The program reads a file path, trimming unnecessary whitespace.
- **Normalization:** Utilizes a method to standardize the file path format.
- **Conditional Logic:** Checks for leading slashes and adjusts the path accordingly.
- **Output:** The final cleaned path is displayed to the user. 

### Final Review
The pseudocode effectively abstracts the original coding structure while preserving the logic of normalizing a file path, making it accessible and clear for readers.
