**Purpose:** The goal of the code is to read a string representing a file path, normalize it by removing unnecessary elements like redundant slashes, and ensure that it starts with a single leading slash.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    FUNCTION normalizeFilePath(inputString):
        // Remove leading and trailing white spaces from the input
        trimmedInput = TRIM(inputString)

        // Normalize the path, removing unnecessary components
        normalizedPath = REMOVE_REDUNDANT_PATH_ELEMENTS(trimmedInput)

        // Ensure the path starts with a single leading slash
        finalPath = ENSURE_SINGLE_LEADING_SLASH(normalizedPath)

        RETURN finalPath

    FUNCTION REMOVE_REDUNDANT_PATH_ELEMENTS(path):
        // Replace multiple consecutive slashes with a single slash
        pathWithSingleSlashes = REPLACE_CONSECUTIVE_SLASHES_WITH_SINGLE(path)

        // Return the modified path
        RETURN pathWithSingleSlashes

    FUNCTION ENSURE_SINGLE_LEADING_SLASH(path):
        // If path starts with multiple slashes, replace with a single leading slash
        IF path starts with '/' THEN
            RETURN the path with leading slashes reduced to a single '/'
        ELSE
            RETURN '/' + path

    // Read input from standard input
    inputFromUser = READ_FROM_STANDARD_INPUT()

    // Normalize the file path
    outputPath = normalizeFilePath(inputFromUser)

    // Print the output path
    PRINT outputPath

END
```

### Key Concepts Explained:

1. **Input Handling:** The program starts by reading a file path input from the user.
2. **Path Normalization:**
   - **Trimming Whitespace:** Leading and trailing spaces are removed from the file path.
   - **Removing Redundant Slashes:** Any occurrences of multiple consecutive slashes in the path are replaced with a single slash.
3. **Correct Leading Slash:** If the normalized path contains multiple leading slashes, it ensures only a single leading slash is retained.
4. **Output:** Finally, it prints the normalized path.

### Comments:
- Each function is responsible for a specific part of the path normalization process.
- The structure allows for easy readability and understanding of what each part of the code is doing.
