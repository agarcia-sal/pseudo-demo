**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**

2. **Read Input:**
   - Read the entire input from the standard input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - Store the result in a variable called `inputPath`.

3. **Normalize Path:**
   - Normalize the `inputPath` to eliminate any redundant separators or up-level references.
   - Store the normalized path in a variable called `normalizedPath`.

4. **Reduce Leading Slashes:**
   - Replace any occurrence of two or more consecutive leading slashes in the `normalizedPath` with a single leading slash.
   - Store the modified path in a variable called `finalPath`.

5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the `finalPath`.

6. **End**  

### Summary:

- The process involves reading a filesystem path, normalizing it, reducing multiple leading slashes to just one, and then outputting the cleaned-up path.
