FUNCTION normalize(inputPath)
    // This function will normalize the input path using platform-specific rules

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by reading the input from the user, mirroring the standard input reading function of the original code.
   
2. **Path Normalization**: The `normalize` function is assumed to take care of normalizing paths, much like the `posixpath.normpath()` function.

3. **Leading Slashes Replacement**: The pseudocode includes the replacement of multiple leading slashes with a single one, functioning similarly to the regular expression operation in the original code.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the cleaned path, ensuring the output matches the result of the original code's `print` function.

The structure is kept simple and logical, making it easily understandable for anyone, regardless of their familiarity with the original programming language.
