**Pseudocode for Normalizing File Paths**

1. **Start** the program.
2. **Read** input from the standard input (e.g., user input or a file).
3. **Remove** any leading and trailing whitespace from the input.
4. **Normalize** the file path:
   - Replace any sequences of forward slashes ("/") at the beginning of the path with a single forward slash ("/").
5. **Print** the normalized file path.

**Detailed Steps**:
- **Input**: Receive a raw file path string.
- **Process**:
  - Clean the file path by standardizing itâ€”ensure that it does not have redundant or multiple slashes at the beginning.
  - Specifically, convert any leading slashes that are excessive (more than one) into a single slash.
- **Output**: Display the final cleaned and normalized file path.

**End** of the program.
