**Purpose:** 
The goal of this code is to read a system path from standard input, normalize it to eliminate redundant path elements, and then format it to ensure it begins with a single forward slash.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program:**
   - Read the input path from the user.
   
2. **Normalize Input Path:**
   - Remove any unnecessary elements from the input path to simplify it.

3. **Format Path:**
   - If the normalized path starts with one or more forward slashes, replace it with a single forward slash.

4. **Display Result:**
   - Output the formatted path to the user.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Get the input path from the user.

2. **Process Input:**
   - Normalize the path by eliminating any extraneous components or redundancies.

3. **Ensure Proper Formatting:**
   - Check if the path begins with multiple forward slashes:
     - If it does, change it so that it starts with only one forward slash.
  
4. **Output the Final Path:**
   - Print the resultant formatted path.

**End Program.** 

This pseudocode conveys the algorithm's core logic and workflow while using straightforward language and structure to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.
