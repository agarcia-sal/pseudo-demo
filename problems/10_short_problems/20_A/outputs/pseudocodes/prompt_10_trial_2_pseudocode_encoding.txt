Here's a clear and concise pseudocode representation of the provided Python code, following the guided steps:

```plaintext
// Pseudocode for normalizing and formatting a file path input

// Step 1: Start the program
BEGIN

    // Step 2: Declare variables
    DECLARE inputPath AS STRING
    DECLARE normalizedPath AS STRING

    // Step 3: Read the input from the standard input (presumed to be a file path)
    SET inputPath TO READ input from standard input

    // Step 4: Normalize the file path to remove redundant separators
    SET normalizedPath TO normalizePath(inputPath)

    // Step 5: Print the normalized file path, ensuring it starts with a single '/'
    PRINT formatPath(normalizedPath)

END

// Helper Functions
FUNCTION normalizePath(path AS STRING) RETURNS STRING
    // Replace multiple consecutive slashes with a single slash
    // Assumption: Path may start with or have multiple slashes
    RETURN path.replace('//', '/')   // Repeat until no more double slashes

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION formatPath(path AS STRING) RETURNS STRING
    // Ensure the path starts with a single '/'
    IF path starts with '/' THEN
        RETURN path
    ELSE
        RETURN '/' + path
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Breakdown of Components:
1. **Variables**: `inputPath` for the raw input and `normalizedPath` for the processed path.
2. **Input Handling**: Read from standard input.
3. **Functionality**: Two helper functions that handle normalization and formatting of paths.
4. **Conditionals**: Check if the path starts with a '/', and adjust accordingly.
5. **Outputs**: Print the formatted path.

### Assumptions:
- Input is expected to be a string representing a file path.
- The path may have leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive slashes that need to be normalized.

### Clarity:
The pseudocode is structured, easy to read, and avoids technical jargon, making it accessible for those familiar with basic programming concepts.
