### Purpose
The goal of the code is to normalize a file path, making it cleaner by removing redundant characters and ensuring it follows a standard format.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION normalizeFilePath:
    // Read the input directly from the user
    inputPath = get user input from standard input

    // Clean up the input by removing unnecessary spaces and normalizing slashes
    cleanedPath = normalize path by removing redundant parts

    // Ensure that the cleaned path starts with a single forward slash
    finalPath = replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    
    // Output the final normalized path
    print finalPath

FUNCTION get user input from standard input:
    // Read the input, strip away any leading or trailing whitespace
    RETURN read input from standard input and remove extra spaces

FUNCTION normalize path by removing redundant parts:
    // This function will convert mixed slashes and resolve any redundant directory symbols
    RETURN path with normalized slashes and resolved navigation symbols

FUNCTION replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash:
    // Check if the path starts with one or more slashes
    IF the path has leading slashes:
        REMOVE all leading slashes EXCEPT one
    RETURN path

// Begin execution
CALL normalizeFilePath
```

### Comments Explanation
- Each function has a clearly defined purpose, such as reading user input, normalizing file paths, and ensuring that the output is formatted correctly.
- High-level actions such as reading input and outputting the result are described plainly.
- Control structures are simplified, explaining the decision-making process without diving into technical syntax.
- Functions allow for modularity, making it easier to understand each piece of the process independently. 

### Iteration Process
This pseudocode has been reviewed to ensure clarity in the steps taken, the organization of functions, and the naming of variables to enhance overall understanding for users who may not be familiar with programming concepts.
