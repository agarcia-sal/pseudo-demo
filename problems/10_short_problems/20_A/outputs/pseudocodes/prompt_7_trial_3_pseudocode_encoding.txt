Below is the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided code snippet.

```
FUNCTION processInputPath()
    // Read the input from standard input and eliminate leading/trailing whitespace
    SET inputPath TO read standard input and strip whitespace

    // Normalize the path to ensure it's in a canonical format
    SET normalizedPath TO normalize the inputPath using posixpath.normpath

    // Substitute any leading slashes with a single slash
    SET finalPath TO replace all occurrences of leading slashes in normalizedPath with a single slash

    // Output the final processed path
    PRINT finalPath
END FUNCTION
```

### Breakdown of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The function reads an input path from standard input and cleans it up by removing unnecessary whitespace.

2. **Path Normalization:**
   - Normalized paths are created in a standard format using `posixpath.normpath`, which helps simplify the path structure (e.g., resolving '..' or '.' components).

3. **Leading Slash Substitution:**
   - The leading slashes of the normalized path are replaced with a single slash using a regular expression.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the processed path is printed.

### Expected Input and Output Context:
- **Input:** A potentially messy file path string entered via standard input (e.g., multiple leading slashes, dot-segments).
- **Expected Output:** A cleaned up and normalized path string with single leading slash (e.g., converting '///folder///file' into '/folder/file'). 

### Clarity Review:
This high-level pseudocode provides a structured understanding of the original code's functionality without delving into the specific programming syntax, making it accessible to readers with varying levels of programming experience.
