**Pseudocode: Normalize and Adjust File Path**

1. **Start** the process.
2. **Read Input:**
   - Obtain a string input from the user, which represents a file path. 
   - Remove any leading and trailing whitespace from this input.
3. **Normalize Path:**
   - Adjust the input path to use the correct format by resolving any '..' or '.' components and simplifying redundant separators.
4. **Modify Leading Slashes:**
   - If the normalized path starts with one or more slashes, replace those leading slashes with a single slash to ensure there is only one at the beginning.
5. **Output the Result:**
   - Display the modified file path.

**End of Process**
