**Purpose Statement:**  
The primary goal of this code is to take a raw path input from the user, normalize it to a standard format, and remove any unnecessary leading slashes before outputting it.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# FUNCTION: Normalize and Clean Input Path
FUNCTION normalize_and_clean_path

    # STEP 1: Read user input
    INPUT: raw_path_string from standard input

    # STEP 2: Normalize the path
    # Normalize means to convert the path into a standard, platform-compatible form
    normalized_path = normalize_path(raw_path_string)

    # STEP 3: Remove unnecessary leading slashes
    # This uses a regular expression to replace one or more leading slashes with a single slash
    cleaned_path = remove_leading_slashes(normalized_path)

    # STEP 4: Print the cleaned path as output
    OUTPUT: cleaned_path
END FUNCTION

# FUNCTION: Normalize path
FUNCTION normalize_path(path)
    # This process involves standardizing the path format
    RETURN: standardized_path
END FUNCTION

# FUNCTION: Remove leading slashes
FUNCTION remove_leading_slashes(path)
    # Use a pattern to find one or more leading slashes and replace them with a single slash
    RETURN: path with leading slashes replaced
END FUNCTION

# MAIN EXECUTION
CALL normalize_and_clean_path
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Input**: The code starts by reading a string representing a file path from user input.
2. **Normalization**: It calls a function to transform the path into a standardized format that fits the operating system's requirements.
3. **Cleanup**: Another function is invoked to clean the path by removing multiple leading slashes, ensuring the output begins with only a single slash.
4. **Output**: Finally, the cleaned path is printed as the final result.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- Each major step has a corresponding function that describes its action, making the code modular and easier to follow.
- Function names clearly indicate their tasks, contributing to the overall readability and comprehension of the code structure.

By structuring the pseudocode in this manner, we ensure that it communicates the intended logic clearly, even to readers who may not be familiar with programming syntax.
