Here's the pseudocode that captures the logic and processes of the provided code:

```
BEGIN

    // Read the input from the standard input
    INPUT rawInput

    // Normalize the input path by removing any redundant separators and up-level references
    normalizedPath = NormalizePath(rawInput)

    // Replace any leading slashes with a single slash
    finalPath = ReplaceLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)

    // Output the processed path
    OUTPUT finalPath

END

FUNCTION NormalizePath(inputPath):
    // Normalize the path by converting it to use the appropriate format for the operating system
    RETURN normalPathUsingSystemRules(inputPath)

FUNCTION ReplaceLeadingSlashes(path):
    // If the path starts with multiple slashes, replace them with a single slash
    IF path STARTS WITH ONE OR MORE '/' THEN
        RETURN '/' + RestOfPath(path)
    ELSE
        RETURN path
    END IF

FUNCTION RestOfPath(path):
    // Return the path excluding the leading slashes
    RETURN path AFTER REMOVING LEADING '/'

END FUNCTION
```

### Breakdown of the Pseudocode:
- The `BEGIN` and `END` keywords indicate the start and end of the logic.
- The input is read from standard input, and unnecessary whitespace is trimmed.
- The `NormalizePath` function simplifies the path according to system rules, similar to the normalization performed by `posixpath.normpath()`.
- The `ReplaceLeadingSlashes` function ensures that if there are multiple leading slashes, they are reduced to a single slash.
- The final processed path is then printed as output. 

This pseudocode presents the structure and intent of the original code in a clear and descriptive manner.
