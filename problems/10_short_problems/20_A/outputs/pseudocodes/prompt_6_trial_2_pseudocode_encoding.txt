```
BEGIN

    // Read input from user and store it as a string
    INPUT userInput AS STRING FROM standard input
    
    // Normalize the file path by removing redundant separators
    normalizedPath = NormalizeFilePath(userInput)
    
    // Print the resulting normalized path
    OUTPUT normalizedPath TO standard output

END

FUNCTION NormalizeFilePath(filePath AS STRING) RETURNS STRING
    
    // Remove leading forward slashes from the file path
    IF filePath STARTS WITH forward slash THEN
        REMOVE leading forward slashes FROM filePath
    END IF

    // Normalize the file path by replacing any sequences of forward slashes with a single forward slash
    normalizedPath = REPLACE multiple forward slashes IN filePath WITH a single forward slash

END FUNCTION
``` 

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode begins with a clear outline of what the program does: it reads a file path from the input, normalizes it, and then outputs the normalized path.
- Each operation is broken down into simple steps, with an emphasis on the logic rather than syntax.
- The `NormalizeFilePath` function is detailed, illustrating how the leading slashes are removed and how multiple slashes are condensed.
- Control structures such as conditionals are described using clear wording to indicate their purpose.
- Descriptive variable and function names enhance understandability.
