### Purpose Summary:
The primary goal of the code is to read a file path input from the user, normalize the path to remove unnecessary characters, and then ensure that the path starts with a single forward slash before outputting the clean path.

### Pseudocode:

1. **Read Input**: 
   - Obtain the string input representing a file path from the user.

2. **Normalize Path**:
   - Use a method to clean up the path, which may include removing any unnecessary separators or adjusting the format to a standard representation of file paths.

3. **Adjust Leading Slashes**:
   - Check if the normalized path starts with one or more leading slashes.
   - If it does, ensure that it only has a single leading slash.

4. **Output Final Path**:
   - Display the cleaned-up file path to the user.

### Detailed Steps:
```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Get user input
    SET inputPath TO read input from the user

    // Step 2: Normalize the input path
    SET normalizedPath TO normalize(inputPath)

    // Step 3: Ensure only one leading slash
    IF normalizedPath starts with one or more slashes THEN
        REMOVE all slashes from the beginning of normalizedPath
        ADD a single slash before the remaining path
    END IF

    // Step 4: Display the final cleaned path
    PRINT normalizedPath

END
```

### Comments:
- **normalize**: This function adjusts the file path format, removing redundant components while maintaining the correct structure.
- **leading slashes**: This step corrects paths that may have excessive leading separators, ensuring the final output is standardized.

### Example Structures:
- The pseudocode utilizes clear variable names and structured logic to follow the flow of the program, which enhances readability and understanding for those unfamiliar with the original programming context.
