```pseudocode
FUNCTION processFilePath(inputFilePath)
    // Normalize the input file path
    normalizedPath = normalizePath(inputFilePath)
    
    // Remove leading slashes from the normalized path
    resultPath = removeLeadingSlashes(normalizedPath)
    
    // Print the final processed path
    PRINT resultPath
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION normalizePath(path)
    // Normalize the given path to a standard format
    RETURN standard format of path
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION removeLeadingSlashes(path)
    // Substitute leading slashes with a single leading slash
    RETURN path with leading slashes replaced by a single slash
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
INITIALIZE inputPath as the input read from the standard input
CALL processFilePath(inputPath)
```

### Context for Complexity:
1. **normalizePath**: This function uses a standard library (posixpath) method to ensure the file path is in a consistent format, handling things like redundant separators or relative components.
2. **removeLeadingSlashes**: This function utilizes a regular expression to ensure that if there are multiple leading slashes, they are replaced with just one, which maintains a clean and uniform output path.

### Input and Output:
- **Input**: A file path read from standard input (e.g., "/something//else").
- **Output**: The normalized file path with only a single leading slash (e.g., "/something/else").
