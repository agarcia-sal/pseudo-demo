```plaintext
BEGIN

  // Read input from the standard input
  INPUT rawInput
  
  // Normalize the file path to standard format
  normalizedPath = NormalizePath(rawInput)

  // Clean up the path to ensure it starts with a single forward slash
  cleanedPath = CleanUpPath(normalizedPath)

  // Output the finalized cleaned path
  OUTPUT cleanedPath

END

FUNCTION NormalizePath(inputPath)
  // Replace any backslashes with forward slashes
  RETURN Replace Backslashes with Forward Slashes in inputPath
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CleanUpPath(path)
  // Remove any leading slashes, leaving only one if present
  IF path starts with multiple slashes THEN
    RETURN a single forward slash followed by the rest of the path
  ELSE
    RETURN path
  END IF
END FUNCTION
``` 

### Explanation:
1. The pseudocode begins by defining the high-level process of reading and normalizing a file path.
2. It describes the flow of input and output.
3. Two functions, `NormalizePath` and `CleanUpPath`, are defined to handle specific tasks. 
4. Conditional logic is clearly outlined for handling leading slashes in the path.
