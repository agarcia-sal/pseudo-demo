### Explanation:

- **Input Processing:** The pseudocode begins by reading a string input representing a file path that may contain unnecessary elements.
  
- **Normalization and Cleaning:** The main logic is structured in functions that handle:
  - Normalizing the path to ensure consistent formatting.
  - Cleaning up multiple leading slashes to always have just one.

- **Output:** Finally, the cleaned-up path is printed. 

Each function serves a distinct purpose, reinforcing clarity and modularity. The pseudocode emphasizes intention without delving into programming-specific details, making it accessible to a broader audience.
