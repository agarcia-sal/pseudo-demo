Hereâ€™s the translation of the provided code into clear and concise pseudocode:

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Assume the input is a string representing a file path
    DECLARE inputPath AS STRING
    
    // Read input from standard input (stdin)
    SET inputPath TO READ_FROM_STANDARD_INPUT()
    
    // Normalize the file path to remove redundant separators
    DECLARE normalizedPath AS STRING
    SET normalizedPath TO NORMALIZE_PATH(inputPath)
    
    // Substitute leading slashes in the normalized path with a single slash
    DECLARE finalPath AS STRING
    SET finalPath TO SUBSTITUTE_LEADING_SLASHES(normalizedPath)
    
    // Output the final processed path
    PRINT finalPath

END PROGRAM


FUNCTION NORMALIZE_PATH(path AS STRING) RETURNS STRING
    // This function normalizes the given path
    RETURN NORMALIZED_PATH

END FUNCTION


FUNCTION SUBSTITUTE_LEADING_SLASHES(path AS STRING) RETURNS STRING
    // This function replaces multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    RETURN REGULAR_EXPRESSION_REPLACE(path, '^/+', '/')

END FUNCTION
```

**Assumptions:**
- The input is expected to be a string that represents a file path, read from standard input.
- The function `REGULAR_EXPRESSION_REPLACE` is assumed to utilize regular expressions for pattern matching and is defined in an environment that supports such operations.

**Key Components Explanation:**
1. **Reading Input:** The program begins by obtaining a string input representing a file path.
2. **Normalization:** It normalizes the path using a function, which likely cleans up the path from unnecessary segments.
3. **Substitution:** It processes the normalized path to replace any leading sequences of slashes with a single slash.
4. **Output:** Finally, the program prints the resulting path in a clear format. 

This structured approach clarifies the process and breaks down the tasks while remaining legible to the reader.
