**Purpose:** This program takes a file path as input, normalizes it to a standard format by removing extra leading slashes, and then outputs the cleaned path.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read input from the user
    FUNCTION readInput()
        // Read the entire input and trim any extra spaces from the beginning and end
        INPUT rawPath FROM user
        RETURN rawPath
    END FUNCTION

    // Step 2: Normalize the file path
    FUNCTION normalizePath(inputPath)
        // Replace any multiple leading slashes with a single leading slash
        normalizedPath = REMOVE_EXTRA_LEADING_SLASHES_OF(inputPath)
        RETURN normalizedPath
    END FUNCTION

    // Step 3: Clean the file path by removing extra leading slashes
    FUNCTION REMOVE_EXTRA_LEADING_SLASHES_OF(path)
        // Use a regular expression to replace all occurrences of one or more slashes at the beginning of the path with a single slash
        cleanedPath = SUBSTITUTE_ONE_OR_MORE_LEADING_SLASHES_WITH_SINGLE_SLASH(path)
        RETURN cleanedPath
    END FUNCTION

    // Step 4: Output the normalized path to the user
    FUNCTION outputNormalizedPath(normalizedPath)
        PRINT normalizedPath
    END FUNCTION

    // Main execution flow
    DECLARE inputPath AS readInput()
    DECLARE normalizedPath AS normalizePath(inputPath)
    outputNormalizedPath(normalizedPath)

END
```

**Notes:**
1. `readInput()` reads the user input, ensuring any surrounding whitespace is removed.
2. `normalizePath()` is responsible for the main normalization process of the input path.
3. `REMOVE_EXTRA_LEADING_SLASHES_OF()` handles the specifics of using a regular expression to clean the path.
4. `outputNormalizedPath()` prints the final result.

**Commentary for Clarity:** 
- The use of descriptive function names and intermediate steps enhances understanding, especially for those who may not be familiar with regular expressions or path normalization.
- The modular design allows readers to understand the program's actions at each level of the process.
