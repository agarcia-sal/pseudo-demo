```pseudocode
BEGIN

    // Read input from standard input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace
    SET inputString TO read from standard input and strip whitespace

    // Normalize the input string to remove redundant path separators
    SET normalizedPath TO normalize the path represented by inputString

    // Replace any sequences of leading slashes with a single slash
    SET finalOutput TO replace all sequences of leading slashes with a single slash in normalizedPath
    
    // Output the final processed path
    PRINT finalOutput

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** It indicates that the program reads an input string from the standard input, and any extra spaces around the input are removed.

2. **Normalization:** The path string is normalized, which typically involves fixing any inconsistencies in path formatting.

3. **Leading Slash Replacement:** It transforms multiple leading slashes into a single slash, ensuring that the path's formatting is clean.

4. **Output:** Finally, it prints the cleaned-up path for the user. 

This structured approach helps clarify the intent and functionalities of the code without the complexities of specific programming syntax.
