Here's a pseudocode representation of the provided code that captures its logic and operations using clear and descriptive language:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Read the entire input from standard input and remove leading and trailing whitespace
    INPUT rawInput FROM standardInput
    normalizedPath = REMOVE_WHITESPACE(rawInput)

    // Normalize the path by converting it to a standard format
    normalizedPath = NORMALIZE_PATH(normalizedPath)

    // Replace multiple leading slashes with a single slash
    modifiedPath = REPLACE_MULTIPLE_LEADING_SLASHES(normalizedPath)

    // Output the final modified path
    OUTPUT modifiedPath TO standardOutput

END


FUNCTION REMOVE_WHITESPACE(inputString)
    RETURN inputString WITH leading and trailing whitespace removed
END FUNCTION


FUNCTION NORMALIZE_PATH(inputString)
    // Convert any path separators to the standard format
    RETURN inputString USING standard path normalization rules
END FUNCTION


FUNCTION REPLACE_MULTIPLE_LEADING_SLASHES(inputString)
    // Using regular expression, replace any sequence of slashes at the start of the string with a single slash
    RETURN inputString AFTER replacing multiple leading slashes with a single slash
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading input, which will be processed.
2. **Whitespace Removal**: It includes a function to remove unnecessary whitespace from the input.
3. **Path Normalization**: A function is used to normalize the path, indicating typical operations like converting slashes to a standard format.
4. **Leading Slash Replacement**: This function uses a concept similar to regex to ensure only a single leading slash remains.
5. **Output**: Finally, the modified path is outputted, demonstrating the algorithmâ€™s result. 

The structure of the pseudocode is clear, modular, and outlines the major steps in the logic while being easy to follow, even for those unfamiliar with programming syntax.
