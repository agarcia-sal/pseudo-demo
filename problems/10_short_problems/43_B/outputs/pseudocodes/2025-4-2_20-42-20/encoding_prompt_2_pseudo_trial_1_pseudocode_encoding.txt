**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read a line of input and store it as **first_string**.
   - Read a second line of input and store it as **second_string**.

2. **String Preprocessing:**
   - Remove all spaces from **first_string** and store the result in **cleaned_first_string**.
   - Remove all spaces from **second_string** and store the result in **cleaned_second_string**.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Initialize an empty list called **character_frequencies** to hold the frequency differences.
   - For each character in the range from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count how many times this character appears in **cleaned_first_string**.
     - Count how many times this character appears in **cleaned_second_string**.
     - Calculate the difference between the count from **cleaned_first_string** and the count from **cleaned_second_string**.
     - Append this difference to **character_frequencies**.

4. **Result Evaluation:**
   - Count how many elements in **character_frequencies** are less than zero.
   - If the count of negative values is zero, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

**Output Requirement:**
- The program should print "YES" if all character frequencies are non-negative, indicating that there are enough characters in the first string to match the second string. Otherwise, it should print "NO".
