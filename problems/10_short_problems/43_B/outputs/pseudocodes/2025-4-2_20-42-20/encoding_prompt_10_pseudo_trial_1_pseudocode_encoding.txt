### Pseudocode

```
BEGIN Main
    // Step 1: Accept two lines of input from the user
    DECLARE firstLine AS STRING
    DECLARE secondLine AS STRING
    READ firstLine
    READ secondLine

    // Step 2: Remove spaces from both lines
    DECLARE cleanedFirstLine AS STRING
    DECLARE cleanedSecondLine AS STRING
    SET cleanedFirstLine = REMOVE_SPACES(firstLine)
    SET cleanedSecondLine = REMOVE_SPACES(secondLine)

    // Step 3: Initialize frequency count for characters
    DECLARE frequencyCounts AS LIST OF INTEGER
    INITIALIZE frequencyCounts WITH LENGTH 58 // Assuming 'A' to 'z' includes 58 characters

    // Step 4: Calculate frequency differences
    FOR each charValue FROM ASCII('A') TO ASCII('z')
        COUNT firstLine IF character EQUALS ASCII(charValue) AND IN cleanedFirstLine
        SET frequencyCounts[charValue - ASCII('A')] = COUNT - NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES IN cleanedSecondLine
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Check for negative frequency counts
    DECLARE isValid AS BOOLEAN
    SET isValid = TRUE
    FOR each count IN frequencyCounts
        IF count < 0 THEN
            SET isValid = FALSE
            BREAK // Exit loop early if any count is negative
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Print result based on frequencies
    IF isValid THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END Main

// Helper Function to Remove Spaces from String
FUNCTION REMOVE_SPACES(inputString AS STRING) RETURNS STRING
    DECLARE result AS STRING
    SET result = ""
    FOR each character IN inputString
        IF character IS NOT ' ' THEN
            APPEND character TO result
        END IF
    END FOR
    RETURN result
END FUNCTION
```

### Assumptions:
- The input consists of valid strings.
- The character 'A' is represented by ASCII value 65 and 'z' by 122, hence the size of frequencyCounts is calculated as 58.
- The REMOVE_SPACES function processes the string to exclude spaces, creating a cleaned string for further analysis.
