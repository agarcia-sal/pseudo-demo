Hereâ€™s a structured pseudocode representation of the provided code snippet:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read input
    DECLARE firstString AS STRING
    DECLARE secondString AS STRING
    firstString = GET user input for the first string
    secondString = GET user input for the second string

    // Step 2: Remove spaces from both strings
    DECLARE filteredFirstString AS LIST OF CHARACTERS
    DECLARE filteredSecondString AS LIST OF CHARACTERS

    FOR EACH character IN firstString DO
        IF character IS NOT a SPACE THEN
            ADD character TO filteredFirstString
        END IF
    END FOR

    FOR EACH character IN secondString DO
        IF character IS NOT a SPACE THEN
            ADD character TO filteredSecondString
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 3: Count character frequency differences
    DECLARE frequencyDifferences AS LIST OF INTEGERS

    FOR EACH characterCode FROM ASCII value of 'A' TO ASCII value of 'z' DO
        DECLARE character AS CHARACTER
        character = CONVERT characterCode TO corresponding CHARACTER
        countInFirstString = COUNT occurrences of character IN filteredFirstString
        countInSecondString = COUNT occurrences of character IN filteredSecondString
        difference = countInFirstString - countInSecondString
        ADD difference TO frequencyDifferences
    END FOR

    // Step 4: Check if any frequency difference is negative
    DECLARE hasNegativeDifference AS BOOLEAN
    hasNegativeDifference = FALSE

    FOR EACH difference IN frequencyDifferences DO
        IF difference < 0 THEN
            hasNegativeDifference = TRUE
            BREAK the loop
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Output the result
    IF hasNegativeDifference IS FALSE THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts by getting inputs from the user twice, storing them as strings.
2. **Space Removal:** It then filters out spaces from both input strings, creating lists that only contain non-space characters.
3. **Character Counting:** It iterates over a range representing ASCII values from 'A' to 'z', counting how many times each character appears in both filtered strings, calculating the difference in occurrences.
4. **Negative Difference Check:** It checks if there are any negative differences indicating that a character appears more in the second string than in the first.
5. **Output Result:** Finally, based on whether any negative differences were found, it prints "YES" or "NO". 

This structured pseudocode captures the intent and flow of the original code while maintaining clarity.
