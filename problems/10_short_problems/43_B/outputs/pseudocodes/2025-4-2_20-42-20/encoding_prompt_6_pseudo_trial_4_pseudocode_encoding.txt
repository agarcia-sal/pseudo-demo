Here is the pseudocode that conveys the logic of the provided code in an understandable format:

```
BEGIN

    // Read two input strings from the user
    STRING firstInput
    STRING secondInput
    firstInput = GET user input for the first string
    secondInput = GET user input for the second string

    // Remove spaces from both input strings
    LIST firstProcessedString
    LIST secondProcessedString
    firstProcessedString = CREATE a new list of characters from firstInput excluding spaces
    secondProcessedString = CREATE a new list of characters from secondInput excluding spaces

    // Initialize a frequency list to hold character count differences
    LIST characterFrequencyDifferences
    characterFrequencyDifferences = CREATE a list of zeroes for each ASCII character from 'A' to 'z'

    // Calculate the differences in character frequencies between the two strings
    FOR each ASCII value from 'A' (65) to 'z' (122):
        CHARACTER currentCharacter = CHARACTER corresponding to ASCII value
        INTEGER countInFirstString = COUNT occurrences of currentCharacter in firstProcessedString
        INTEGER countInSecondString = COUNT occurrences of currentCharacter in secondProcessedString
        INTEGER frequencyDifference = countInFirstString - countInSecondString
        SET characterFrequencyDifferences at current ASCII index to frequencyDifference

    // Check if there are any negative differences in the frequency
    INTEGER negativeCount = COUNT occurrences of negative values in characterFrequencyDifferences

    // Determine the final output based on negative counts
    IF negativeCount equals 0 THEN
        PRINT "YES"  // There are no negative frequency differences
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"   // There are negative frequency differences

END
```

### Summary of Key Operations:

- **Input Handling**: The program starts by receiving two strings from the user.
- **Processing Inputs**: Spaces are removed from both strings for accurate character counting.
- **Character Frequency Calculation**: The code compares the frequency of each character in both strings, storing the differences.
- **Evaluation**: Finally, the program checks for any negative frequency differences and prints "YES" if there are none, or "NO" if there are any. 

This pseudocode provides a clear breakdown of the original algorithm, maintaining the same logical flow while ensuring readability and understanding for anyone unfamiliar with programming syntax.
