Here's a clear and concise pseudocode version of the given Python code, following the provided guidelines:

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - PROMPT user to input the first string (s1)
   - PROMPT user to input the second string (s2)
   
2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - SET cleaned_s1 as the string formed by removing spaces from s1
   - SET cleaned_s2 as the string formed by removing spaces from s2

3. **Initialize Frequency List:**
   - CREATE an empty list called freqs

4. **Calculate Character Frequencies:**
   - FOR each character code (x) from the ASCII value of 'A' (65) to the ASCII value of 'z' (122):
     - SET freq_difference as the count of character represented by x in cleaned_s1 minus the count of that character in cleaned_s2
     - APPEND freq_difference to freqs

5. **Check for Negative Frequencies:**
   - SET negative_count as the number of negative values in freqs

6. **Output Result:**
   - IF negative_count equals 0 THEN
     - PRINT "YES"
   - ELSE
     - PRINT "NO"

---

**Assumptions:**
- The input strings (s1 and s2) consist of alphabetic characters and spaces.
- The comparison is case-sensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' are treated as different characters.
- The count method can handle strings and returns the number of occurrences for each specified character.

This pseudocode maintains clarity and is structured to make the logic easily understandable while highlighting main components and their functions.
