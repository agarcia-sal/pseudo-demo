Here's the pseudocode that follows the outlined steps:

```
1. Begin Program

2. Initialize a list s1
3. Initialize a list s2

4. Read first input and store it in variable 'first_input'
5. Read second input and store it in variable 'second_input'

6. For each character in 'first_input':
    a. If the character is not a space:
        i. Add the character to list s1

7. For each character in 'second_input':
    a. If the character is not a space:
        i. Add the character to list s2

8. Initialize a list freqs to store frequency differences
9. For each integer x from the ASCII value of 'A' to the ASCII value of 'z':
    a. Count the occurrences of the character corresponding to x in s1
    b. Count the occurrences of the character corresponding to x in s2
    c. Subtract the count from s2 from the count from s1
    d. Store the result in freqs

10. Count the number of elements in freqs that are less than 0
11. If the count is equal to 0:
    a. Output "YES"
12. Else:
    a. Output "NO"

13. End Program
```

### Assumptions:
- The inputs consist of strings that may contain space characters.
- The data type of the strings allows for character iteration and counting occurrences.
- The ASCII values for characters between 'A' and 'z' cover the relevant range for this computation.
