**Summary of Purpose:**  
The code compares two input strings to determine if the number of each character in the first string is equal to or greater than the number in the second string, ignoring spaces.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define the Functionality:**
   - The program compares character frequencies between two user-provided strings.

2. **Input the Strings:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first string.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second string.
  
3. **Process the Strings:**
   - For both input strings, create lists of characters that exclude any spaces.
      - **For each string:** 
        - Create a list of characters by checking if each character is not a space.

4. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - Initialize a list called 'frequencyDifference' to store the difference in counts of each character from the first and second strings.
   - For each character in the range of valid character codes (from 'A' to 'z'):
     - Count how many times that character appears in the first string.
     - Count how many times that character appears in the second string.
     - Calculate the difference: count from the first string minus count from the second string, and store it in 'frequencyDifference'.

5. **Check the Conditions:**
   - Count how many values in 'frequencyDifference' are negative (indicating the second string has more of that character than the first).
   - If there are no negative values, it means the first string can match or exceed the counts in the second string; otherwise, it cannot.

6. **Output the Result:**
   - Display "YES" if there are no negative values; otherwise, display "NO".

**Detailed Pseudocode:**
```
BEGIN PROGRAM

  // Step 1: Input the two strings
  PROMPT "Enter the first string" AND STORE INPUT in firstString
  PROMPT "Enter the second string" AND STORE INPUT in secondString

  // Step 2: Remove spaces and create character lists
  REMOVE SPACES from firstString AND STORE in list1
  REMOVE SPACES from secondString AND STORE in list2

  // Step 3: Initialize frequency difference list
  INITIALIZE frequencyDifference as an empty list

  // Step 4: Calculate frequency differences for each character A to z
  FOR each characterCode from ASCII value of 'A' to ASCII value of 'z' DO
      characterCountInFirst = COUNT of character in list1
      characterCountInSecond = COUNT of character in list2
      difference = characterCountInFirst - characterCountInSecond
      APPEND difference to frequencyDifference

  // Step 5: Check for negatives in frequency difference
  negativeCount = COUNT of values in frequencyDifference that are less than 0

  // Step 6: Output the result
  IF negativeCount is 0 THEN
      PRINT "YES"
  ELSE
      PRINT "NO"

END PROGRAM
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The input step captures user strings.
- Spaces are ignored in the comparison by removing them from the lists.
- The frequency of each character is counted and compared between the two strings.
- The condition checks whether the first string's characters can cover those in the second.
