Here's the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION compareCharacterFrequencies()
    // Read input strings from the user
    INITIALIZE firstInputString AS input from user
    INITIALIZE secondInputString AS input from user
    
    // Remove spaces from both input strings and store the results
    INITIALIZE firstStringCharacters AS list of characters from firstInputString excluding spaces
    INITIALIZE secondStringCharacters AS list of characters from secondInputString excluding spaces
    
    // Initialize a list to hold frequency differences for each ASCII character
    INITIALIZE frequencyDifferences AS empty list

    // Loop through ASCII values for characters from 'A' to 'z'
    FOR each ASCII value x FROM ord('A') TO ord('z') DO
        // Calculate the frequency of character and add to frequencyDifferences
        INITIALIZE difference AS count of firstStringCharacters for character chr(x) minus count of secondStringCharacters for character chr(x)
        APPEND difference TO frequencyDifferences
    END FOR

    // Check if all frequency differences are non-negative
    IF there are no negative values in frequencyDifferences THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The function begins by reading two strings from user input.
2. **Space Removal:** It creates lists of characters for both input strings while removing any spaces.
3. **Frequency Calculation:** It computes the frequency difference for each ASCII character from 'A' to 'z'. This involves counting how many times each character appears in both strings and computing the difference (first string count minus second string count).
4. **Result Evaluation:** It checks if all differences are non-negative and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the evaluation.

### Context for Complexity:
- The code utilizes a list comprehension and ASCII character manipulation, which is straightforward but may require a brief understanding of character encoding and list operations.
- By defining operations in simple terms, the pseudocode aims to be accessible to readers with various levels of programming experience while capturing the essence of the original code logic.
