Here is a structured pseudocode translation of the provided code snippet, focusing on clarity and intent:

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Get user input
    DISPLAY "Enter the first string:"
    string1 = GET user input
    
    DISPLAY "Enter the second string:"
    string2 = GET user input

    // Step 2: Clean the input strings by removing spaces
    cleanString1 = REMOVE spaces from string1
    cleanString2 = REMOVE spaces from string2

    // Step 3: Initialize an array to hold frequency differences
    frequencyDifferences = ARRAY of size (number of characters in range 'A' to 'z')

    // Step 4: Calculate the frequency of each character
    FOR each character in range from 'A' to 'z' DO
        countInString1 = COUNT occurrences of character in cleanString1
        countInString2 = COUNT occurrences of character in cleanString2
        frequencyDifferences[character] = countInString1 - countInString2
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Check if all frequency differences are non-negative
    negativeFrequencyCount = 0

    FOR each difference in frequencyDifferences DO
        IF difference < 0 THEN
            negativeFrequencyCount = negativeFrequencyCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Output the result based on frequency check
    IF negativeFrequencyCount == 0 THEN
        DISPLAY "YES"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "NO"
    END IF
END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Input Section**: Captures user input for two strings.
- **Cleaning Step**: Removes spaces from the input strings to ensure character counts are accurate.
- **Frequency Calculation**: Initializes an array to store the difference in character frequencies between the two strings.
- **Looping through Characters**: Iterates through all characters from 'A' to 'z', calculating the count of each character in both strings and updating the frequency array.
- **Non-negative Check**: Counts how many frequencies are negative, signaling that the first string has fewer occurrences than the second.
- **Output**: Final result checked through a simple condition to print "YES" if all character counts are non-negative, else "NO".

This structured approach maintains focus on the logic and flow of the original code while providing meaningful names and clarity.
