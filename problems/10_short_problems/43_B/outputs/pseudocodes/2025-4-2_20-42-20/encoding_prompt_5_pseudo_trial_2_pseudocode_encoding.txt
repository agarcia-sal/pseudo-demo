### Purpose
The primary goal of this code is to compare the frequency of each character in two input strings and determine if all characters in the first string occur at least as many times as they do in the second string.

### Pseudocode

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Receive two input strings from the user, removing any spaces.
    SET first_input_string TO remove_spaces(GET_USER_INPUT())
    SET second_input_string TO remove_spaces(GET_USER_INPUT())

    // Step 2: Create two variables to hold the character counts for the input strings.
    SET first_string_character_counts TO count_characters(first_input_string)
    SET second_string_character_counts TO count_characters(second_input_string)

    // Step 3: Compare the character counts between the two strings.
    SET frequency_differences TO calculate_frequency_differences(first_string_character_counts, second_string_character_counts)

    // Step 4: Check if all frequency differences are zero or positive.
    IF all_counts_are_non_negative(frequency_differences) THEN
        PRINT "YES"  // The first string has equal or more characters than the second.
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"   // The first string does not have enough of some characters.
    END IF

END


// Helper function to remove spaces from a string.
FUNCTION remove_spaces(input_string)
    RETURN string_without_spaces  // Remove each space from the input string.
END FUNCTION

// Helper function to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
FUNCTION count_characters(string)
    INITIALIZE character_count_array WITH zero_values  // Create an array of size 256 (for ASCII characters).
    FOR each character IN string DO
        INCREMENT character_count_array[character]  // Count the occurrences.
    END FOR
    RETURN character_count_array
END FUNCTION

// Helper function to calculate the frequency differences for all characters.
FUNCTION calculate_frequency_differences(counts1, counts2)
    INITIALIZE differences_array
    FOR each character_code FROM 0 TO 255 DO 
        DIFFERENCE = counts1[character_code] - counts2[character_code]
        ADD DIFFERENCE to differences_array
    END FOR
    RETURN differences_array
END FUNCTION

// Helper function to check if all counts in the differences array are non-negative.
FUNCTION all_counts_are_non_negative(differences_array)
    FOR each count IN differences_array DO
        IF count < 0 THEN
            RETURN FALSE  // Found a count that is negative.
        END IF
    END FOR
    RETURN TRUE  // All counts are non-negative.
END FUNCTION
```

### Comments 
- The pseudocode provides a step-by-step breakdown of the code's logic while clearly defining operations with straightforward language.
- Each helper function is described, enabling better understanding of complex operations like counting characters or checking conditions.
- The organization of the pseudocode adheres to a logical flow, from user input to output decision, making it accessible to readers not familiar with programming syntax.
