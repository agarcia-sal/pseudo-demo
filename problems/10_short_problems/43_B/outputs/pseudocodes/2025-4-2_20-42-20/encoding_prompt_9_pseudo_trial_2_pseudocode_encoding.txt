**Purpose:** This program compares two strings, checking if the second string can be constructed from the characters of the first string, ignoring spaces. It outputs "YES" if this is possible, otherwise "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Strings:**
   - Receive two strings from the user (let's call them `firstString` and `secondString`).

2. **Process Input:**
   - Remove any spaces from `firstString`.
   - Remove any spaces from `secondString`.

3. **Initialize Frequency Count:**
   - Create a list called `characterDifferences` to hold the count of character differences between the two strings.
   - For each character in the range from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count how many times this character appears in `firstString` and how many times it appears in `secondString`.
     - Calculate the difference: the count in `firstString` minus the count in `secondString`.
     - Store this difference in `characterDifferences`.

4. **Check Feasibility:**
   - Count how many values in `characterDifferences` are negative.
   - If there are no negative values, it means `secondString` can be created using characters from `firstString`. Otherwise, it cannot.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - If all values in `characterDifferences` are non-negative, print "YES". 
   - If there are any negative values, print "NO".

This pseudocode abstracts away the specific syntax of the programming language, focusing instead on the logical flow and processes involved in the algorithm.
