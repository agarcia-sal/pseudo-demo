**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input:**
   - Read a line of input and store it as the first string, named `firstString`.
   - Read a second line of input and store it as the second string, named `secondString`.

2. **Process Input:**
   - Create two lists named `processedFirstString` and `processedSecondString`.
   - For each character in `firstString`:
     - If the character is not a space, add it to `processedFirstString`.
   - For each character in `secondString`:
     - If the character is not a space, add it to `processedSecondString`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Create a list named `frequencyDifferences` to store the differences in character frequencies.
   - For each character code from the ASCII value of 'A' to the ASCII value of 'z':
     - Count how many times the character appears in `processedFirstString`.
     - Count how many times the character appears in `processedSecondString`.
     - Calculate the difference between the two counts (first string's count minus second string's count) and add this difference to `frequencyDifferences`.

4. **Condition Check and Output:**
   - Check if there are any negative values in `frequencyDifferences`.
     - If there are no negative values, output "YES".
     - If there is at least one negative value, output "NO". 

**Input Requirements:**
- Two strings, which may contain spaces.

**Output Requirements:**
- A single word: "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions checked.
