**Purpose:** This code checks whether the characters in the first string are sufficient to match the characters in the second string, ignoring spaces. It will output "YES" if this is true and "NO" otherwise.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Main Function:** Start the main process.
   
2. **Get User Input:** 
   - Prompt the user to enter the first string and store it as `firstString`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second string and store it as `secondString`.

3. **Prepare Strings:**
   - Remove all spaces from `firstString` and `secondString`:
     - Create a variable `cleanedFirstString` containing all characters in `firstString` that are not spaces.
     - Create a variable `cleanedSecondString` containing all characters in `secondString` that are not spaces.

4. **Initialize Frequency List:**
   - Create a list named `characterFrequency` with 52 elements (for uppercase 'A'-'Z' and lowercase 'a'-'z'), all initially set to 0.

5. **Count Characters:**  
   - For each character in `cleanedFirstString`:
     - Increment the corresponding index in `characterFrequency` based on the character's ASCII value.
   - For each character in `cleanedSecondString`:
     - Decrement the corresponding index in `characterFrequency` based on the character's ASCII value.

6. **Check Character Sufficiency:** 
   - Set a variable `isSufficient` to `True`.
   - For each count in `characterFrequency`:
     - If the count is negative, set `isSufficient` to `False` and break out of the loop.

7. **Output Result:**
   - If `isSufficient` is `True`, print "YES".
   - Else, print "NO".

**Comments:**
- The algorithm relies on counting the characters from both strings to ensure that the first string has enough occurrences of each character that exists in the second string.
- It uses ASCII values to map characters into a fixed-size frequency list, which simplifies character comparison and counting.
