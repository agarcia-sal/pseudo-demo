**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input:** Read two strings from the user, representing the two sets of characters (let's call them `firstString` and `secondString`).
2. **Process Input:**
   - Remove all spaces from `firstString` and store the result in `cleanedFirst`.
   - Remove all spaces from `secondString` and store the result in `cleanedSecond`.
3. **Initialize Frequency Difference List:** Create an empty list called `frequencyDifferences`.
4. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - For each character (from 'A' to 'z'):
     - Count how many times this character appears in `cleanedFirst` and store it in a variable called `countInFirst`.
     - Count how many times this character appears in `cleanedSecond` and store it in a variable called `countInSecond`.
     - Calculate the difference between `countInFirst` and `countInSecond` and append this difference to `frequencyDifferences`.
5. **Check Frequency Differences:** 
   - Count how many values in `frequencyDifferences` are less than zero.
6. **Output Result:**
   - If there are no negative values in `frequencyDifferences`, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO". 

This pseudocode outlines the logic of counting character frequencies from two inputs, comparing their counts, and determining if one string has characters that the other doesn't by checking for any negative frequency differences.
