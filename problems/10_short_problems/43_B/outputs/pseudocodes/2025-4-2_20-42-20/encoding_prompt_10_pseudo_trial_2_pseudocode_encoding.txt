Here's the pseudocode based on the provided instructions:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Accept input
    DECLARE firstString AS STRING
    DECLARE secondString AS STRING
    PRINT "Please enter the first string:"
    READ firstString
    PRINT "Please enter the second string:"
    READ secondString

    // Step 2: Remove spaces from both strings
    DECLARE cleanedString1 AS LIST OF CHAR
    DECLARE cleanedString2 AS LIST OF CHAR
    FOR EACH character IN firstString DO
        IF character IS NOT ' ' THEN
            ADD character TO cleanedString1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    FOR EACH character IN secondString DO
        IF character IS NOT ' ' THEN
            ADD character TO cleanedString2
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 3: Calculate frequency differences of characters
    DECLARE frequencyDifferences AS LIST OF INTEGER
    FOR each ASCII-value FROM ASCII('A') TO ASCII('z') DO
        DECLARE currentChar AS CHAR = CHAR(ASCII-value)
        DECLARE countInFirst AS INTEGER = countOccurrences(currentChar, cleanedString1)
        DECLARE countInSecond AS INTEGER = countOccurrences(currentChar, cleanedString2)
        ADD (countInFirst - countInSecond) TO frequencyDifferences
    END FOR

    // Step 4: Check if there are any negative frequency differences
    DECLARE hasNegativeFrequency AS BOOLEAN = FALSE
    FOR EACH difference IN frequencyDifferences DO
        IF difference < 0 THEN
            SET hasNegativeFrequency TO TRUE
            BREAK
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 5: Output result
    IF NOT hasNegativeFrequency THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END

// Helper function to count occurrences of a character in a character list
FUNCTION countOccurrences(targetChar AS CHAR, characterList AS LIST OF CHAR) RETURNS INTEGER
    DECLARE count AS INTEGER = 0
    FOR EACH character IN characterList DO
        IF character IS targetChar THEN
            INCREMENT count
        END IF
    END FOR
    RETURN count
END FUNCTION
```

### Assumptions:
- Input strings can contain spaces which should be ignored.
- Characters are compared in a case-sensitive manner.
- The strings are expected to be in a format that can be processed as individual characters.
- The ASCII values between 'A' and 'z' are being considered for frequency counting (inclusive).
