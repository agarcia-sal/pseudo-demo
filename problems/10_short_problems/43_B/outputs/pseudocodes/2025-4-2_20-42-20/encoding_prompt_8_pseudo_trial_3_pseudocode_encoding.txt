**Purpose**: The goal of this program is to compare two input strings and determine if the first string contains at least as many occurrences of each character (ignoring spaces) as the second string.

**Pseudocode**:

```
BEGIN

    // Get input from the user, two separate strings
    STRING firstInput = GET user input
    STRING secondInput = GET user input

    // Remove spaces from both input strings
    LIST firstStringCharacters = CREATE list of characters from firstInput without spaces
    LIST secondStringCharacters = CREATE list of characters from secondInput without spaces

    // Initialize a list to store frequency differences
    LIST frequencyDifferences = CREATE an empty list

    // For each character in the range from 'A' to 'z'
    FOR each characterCode FROM ASCII value of 'A' TO ASCII value of 'z' DO
        // Convert character code to character
        CHARACTER currentCharacter = CHARACTER from characterCode
        
        // Count occurrences of currentCharacter in firstStringCharacters
        INTEGER countInFirstInput = COUNT of currentCharacter in firstStringCharacters
        
        // Count occurrences of currentCharacter in secondStringCharacters
        INTEGER countInSecondInput = COUNT of currentCharacter in secondStringCharacters
        
        // Calculate the difference in counts and add to the list
        INTEGER difference = countInFirstInput - countInSecondInput
        ADD difference to frequencyDifferences

    END FOR

    // Check if there are any negative differences
    INTEGER negativeCount = COUNT of elements in frequencyDifferences that are less than zero

    // Output "YES" if there are no negative differences, otherwise "NO"
    IF negativeCount is equal to 0 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END
```

### Comments for Clarity:
- The program first collects two strings from the user input.
- Spaces are ignored when counting character occurrences in both strings.
- By comparing the counts of characters between the two strings, the program determines whether the first string has enough of each character to match the second string.
- The output is conditional, providing feedback based on whether all character counts meet the necessary criteria.
