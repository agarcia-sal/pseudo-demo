**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input**  
   - Read two separate lines of input strings, representing `String1` and `String2`.

2. **Remove Spaces**  
   - Create a new list `CleanedString1` by iterating through each character in `String1`, adding only the characters that are not spaces.
   - Create a new list `CleanedString2` by iterating through each character in `String2`, adding only the characters that are not spaces.

3. **Initialize Frequency Difference List**  
   - Create an empty list called `FrequencyDifferences`.

4. **Calculate Frequency Differences**  
   - For each character code from the ASCII value of 'A' (65) to the ASCII value of 'z' (122):
     - Count how many times the character occurs in `CleanedString1` and how many times it occurs in `CleanedString2`.
     - Calculate the difference between the frequency in `CleanedString1` and `CleanedString2`, and add the result to `FrequencyDifferences`.

5. **Check Frequency Differences**  
   - Count how many values in `FrequencyDifferences` are negative (this indicates that `CleanedString2` has more of that character than `CleanedString1`).

6. **Output Result**  
   - If the count of negative values is zero, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".
