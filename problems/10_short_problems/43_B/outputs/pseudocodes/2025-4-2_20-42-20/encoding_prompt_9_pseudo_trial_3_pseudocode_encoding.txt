**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to determine if two input strings are anagrams, meaning they contain the same characters in the same frequency, ignoring spaces.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first string without spaces.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second string without spaces.

2. **Remove Spaces from Input:**
   - For each user input string, create a new version by including only non-space characters.

3. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - Initialize a list to store frequency differences of characters.
   - For each character in the range of ASCII values from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count how many times this character appears in the first string.
     - Count how many times this character appears in the second string.
     - Calculate the frequency difference by subtracting the second string's count from the first string's count.
     - Store this difference in the list.

4. **Check Frequency Differences:**
   - Count how many values in the frequency difference list are less than zero.
   - If there are no negative values in the frequency difference list, it means the strings are anagrams.

5. **Generate Output:**
   - If there are no negative frequency differences, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

**Illustration of Input and Output:**
- **Input:** Two strings provided by the user.
- **Output:** A single word, either "YES" or "NO", indicating whether the two strings are anagrams.

**Example Steps in Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

  // Step 1: Get User Input
  DISPLAY "Enter the first string:"
  firstString = GET user input

  DISPLAY "Enter the second string:"
  secondString = GET user input

  // Step 2: Remove Spaces
  string1 = REMOVE spaces from firstString
  string2 = REMOVE spaces from secondString

  // Step 3: Count Character Frequencies
  frequencyDifference = INITIALIZE an empty list

  FOR each character in ASCII range from 'A' to 'z' DO
    countInFirst = COUNT occurrences of character in string1
    countInSecond = COUNT occurrences of character in string2
    diff = countInFirst - countInSecond
    ADD diff to frequencyDifference

  // Step 4: Check Frequency Differences
  negativeCount = COUNT how many values in frequencyDifference are less than 0

  // Step 5: Generate Output
  IF negativeCount is 0 THEN
    DISPLAY "YES"
  ELSE
    DISPLAY "NO"

END
```

This pseudocode maintains the essential logic of the original code while being easily understandable and structured for the reader.
