**Purpose:** The main objective of this code is to compare two input strings and determine if they contain the same characters in terms of frequency, ignoring spaces.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Function to Compare Character Frequencies in Two Strings:**

    FUNCTION CompareCharacterFrequencies

    **Input:**
    - Get the first string from the user
    - Get the second string from the user

    **Process:**
    - Initialize a list named `cleanedStrings` to store the processed versions of the input strings.
        - For each string input:
            - Remove all spaces and store the cleaned version.
    
    - Initialize a list named `frequencyDifferences` to hold the difference in character counts for each character from 'A' to 'z' (inclusive).
        - For each character code from the ASCII value of 'A' to the ASCII value of 'z':
            - Count how many times the character appears in the first cleaned string.
            - Count how many times the character appears in the second cleaned string.
            - Calculate the difference between these two counts and store it in `frequencyDifferences`.

    - Check if all values in `frequencyDifferences` are greater than or equal to zero, indicating that the first string does not have fewer occurrences of any character than the second string.
        - If this condition is true, output "YES" (indicating the character frequencies match).
        - If this condition is not true, output "NO" (indicating a mismatch in character frequencies).

**Detailed Breakdown:**

- **Input:**
  - Prompt the user to enter two separate strings.

- **Processing Steps:**
  1. Read the first string and remove all spaces.
  2. Read the second string and remove all spaces.
  3. For each character from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count occurrences of this character in the first cleaned string.
     - Count occurrences of this character in the second cleaned string.
     - Determine the difference in counts (first count minus second count).
     - Store this difference in a list.

- **Output:**
  - Count how many differences in the list are negative (indicating the second string has more of that character than the first).
  - If no differences are negative, print "YES".
  - If there is at least one negative difference, print "NO".

**Comments for Clarity:**
- This pseudocode uses clear and descriptive names for functions and variables to make it easier for readers to understand.
- The separation of string cleaning and frequency counting processes allows for better comprehension and debugging, should it be necessary.
