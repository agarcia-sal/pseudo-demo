**Purpose:**  
The primary goal of the code is to compare two input strings, determining whether the characters in the first string can fully match those in the second string when spaces are ignored.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Function:**  
   **Function CompareStrings:**  
      - **Input:** Two strings entered by the user.  
      - **Output:** A confirmation of whether the first string has at least the same frequency of characters as the second string.

2. **Read User Input:**
   - **Prompt User for Input:** Treat spaces as non-existent and capture the first string.  
   - **Prompt User for Input:** Treat spaces as non-existent and capture the second string.  
   - **Remove Spaces:** For each captured string, create a new version omitting any spaces.

3. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - **Initialize Frequency List:** Create a list to hold the difference in frequency counts for each character (from 'A' to 'z').
   - **For Each Character in the Range from ASCII of 'A' to ASCII of 'z':**
     - **Count in String 1:** Count how many times this character appears in the first string. 
     - **Count in String 2:** Count how many times this character appears in the second string. 
     - **Calculate Difference:** Store the difference in frequencies (String 1 count minus String 2 count) in the frequency list.

4. **Evaluate Character Frequencies:**
   - **Check for Non-Negative Counts:** Count how many items in the frequency list are less than zero (indicating that string 1 lacks some characters present in string 2).

5. **Output Result:**
   - **If Count of Negative Frequencies is Zero:**  
       - Print "YES" (indicating string 1 can match characters of string 2).
   - **Else:**
       - Print "NO" (indicating string 1 cannot match characters of string 2).

**Comments for Clarity:**
- Input handling focuses on stripping out inefficient characters (spaces).
- The frequency counts provide a direct comparison metric between the two strings.
- The final output serves as a simple yes/no answer based on the presence of sufficient characters.

**Example Structure:**
```
Function CompareStrings:
    Input firstString
    Input secondString
    Remove spaces from firstString
    Remove spaces from secondString
    
    Initialize frequencyDifferences as an empty list
    
    For each character from 'A' to 'z':
        Count charInFirst from firstString
        Count charInSecond from secondString
        Difference = charInFirst - charInSecond
        Add Difference to frequencyDifferences
    
    If no negative counts in frequencyDifferences:
        Print "YES"
    Else:
        Print "NO"
```

**Iterate for Improvement:**  
This pseudocode has been reviewed for clarity and logical flow, ensuring that the operations effectively communicate the intended comparison logic between the two input strings.
