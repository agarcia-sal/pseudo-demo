        ADD difference to frequencyDifference

    // Determine if any frequency difference is negative
    // If no character has more occurrences in the second string than the first
    INTEGER negativeCount = count of values in frequencyDifference that are less than 0

    // Output: Print "YES" if all frequency differences are non-negative, otherwise print "NO"
    IF negativeCount is equal to 0 THEN
        PRINT "YES"

**Explanation:**
- The pseudocode captures the main logic of reading two strings, removing spaces, calculating the frequency differences for each character, and checking if there are any negative differences in frequency. The flow is represented in a structured way, ensuring clarity regarding inputs, processes, and outputs.
