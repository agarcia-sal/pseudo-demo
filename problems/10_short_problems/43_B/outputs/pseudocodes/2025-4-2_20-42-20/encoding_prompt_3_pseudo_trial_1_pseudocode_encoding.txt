Certainly! Here's a translation of the provided code into structured pseudocode, focusing on conveying the core logic and intent without getting caught up in specific syntax.

```
BEGIN
    // Read two strings from user input, removing spaces
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    
    firstInput = Get user input for the first string
    secondInput = Get user input for the second string
    
    // Remove spaces from both inputs
    DECLARE cleanedFirstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE cleanedSecondInput AS STRING
    cleanedFirstInput = Remove all spaces from firstInput
    cleanedSecondInput = Remove all spaces from secondInput
    
    // Initialize a frequency difference list to track character count differences
    DECLARE frequencyDifferences AS LIST OF INTEGER

    // For each character in the range from 'A' to 'z'
    FOR each characterCode FROM ASCII value of 'A' TO ASCII value of 'z' DO
        // Count occurrences in each cleaned input
        DECLARE countInFirstInput AS INTEGER
        DECLARE countInSecondInput AS INTEGER
        
        countInFirstInput = Count occurrences of character represented by characterCode in cleanedFirstInput
        countInSecondInput = Count occurrences of character represented by characterCode in cleanedSecondInput
        
        // Calculate the difference in counts and add to the frequencyDifferences list
        ADD (countInFirstInput - countInSecondInput) TO frequencyDifferences
    END FOR

    // Check if all frequency differences are non-negative
    DECLARE nonNegativeCount AS INTEGER
    nonNegativeCount = Count how many items in frequencyDifferences are less than 0

    // Output the result based on whether any negative counts were found
    IF nonNegativeCount == 0 THEN
        Print "YES"
    ELSE
        Print "NO"
    END IF
END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling**: It starts with reading two strings from the user and removes spaces, handling inputs at a high level.
2. **Character Counting**: It iterates over the ASCII values of characters from 'A' to 'z', counts occurrences in both strings, and computes the difference.
3. **Output Decision**: Finally, it checks if all differences are non-negative and prints either "YES" or "NO" based on this condition.

This structured approach keeps the flow logical and interpretable for someone unfamiliar with the original code.
