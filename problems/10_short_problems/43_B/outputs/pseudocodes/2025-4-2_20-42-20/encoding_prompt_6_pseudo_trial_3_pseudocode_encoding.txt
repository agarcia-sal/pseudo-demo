Here's a clear and comprehensible pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```plaintext
1. FUNCTION main
2.     // Get two input strings from the user
3.     PROMPT user for the first string, store it as firstString
4.     PROMPT user for the second string, store it as secondString

5.     // Remove all spaces from the input strings
6.     firstStringWithoutSpaces = REMOVE_SPACES(firstString)
7.     secondStringWithoutSpaces = REMOVE_SPACES(secondString)

8.     // Initialize a list to hold frequency differences
9.     frequencyDifferences = INITIALIZE empty list

10.    // Calculate frequency differences for each character from 'A' to 'z'
11.    FOR each characterCode FROM ASCII value of 'A' TO ASCII value of 'z'
12.        countInFirstString = countOccurrences(firstStringWithoutSpaces, characterCode)
13.        countInSecondString = countOccurrences(secondStringWithoutSpaces, characterCode)
14.        difference = countInFirstString - countInSecondString
15.        APPEND difference to frequencyDifferences

16.    // Check if there are any negative frequency differences
17.    IF NO negative values in frequencyDifferences THEN
18.        PRINT "YES" // Indicates first string can be made to match second string
19.    ELSE
20.        PRINT "NO" // Indicates first string cannot be made to match second string

21. END FUNCTION

FUNCTION REMOVE_SPACES(inputString)
22.    RETURN inputString with all spaces removed
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION countOccurrences(inputString, characterCode)
23.    RETURN number of times character corresponding to characterCode occurs in inputString
END FUNCTION
```

### Summary of the Pseudocode:
- The main function prompts the user twice for two strings.
- It removes spaces from both strings.
- It counts the occurrences of each character (from 'A' to 'z') in both strings and calculates the difference in counts.
- If all differences are non-negative, the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
