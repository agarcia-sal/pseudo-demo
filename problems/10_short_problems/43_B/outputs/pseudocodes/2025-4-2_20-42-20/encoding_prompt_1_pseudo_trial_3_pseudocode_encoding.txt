**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input two strings:** 
   - Read the first string from the user.
   - Read the second string from the user.

2. **Process the strings to remove spaces:**
   - For each string, create a new string that includes only characters that are not spaces.

3. **Initialize a frequency list:**
   - Create an empty list to store frequency differences for each character from 'A' to 'z'.

4. **Calculate the frequency difference:**
   - For each character in the range from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count how many times that character appears in the first string.
     - Count how many times that character appears in the second string.
     - Subtract the count from the second string from the count from the first string.
     - Store the result in the frequency list.

5. **Check the frequency list for negative values:**
   - Count how many values in the frequency list are less than zero.

6. **Output the result:**
   - If there are no negative values in the frequency list (i.e., the count is zero), print "YES".
   - If there is at least one negative value, print "NO".
