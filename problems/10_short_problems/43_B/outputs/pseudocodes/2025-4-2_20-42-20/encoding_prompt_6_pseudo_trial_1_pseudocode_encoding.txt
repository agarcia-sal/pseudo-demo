Here is the pseudocode that summarizes the functionality of the provided code clearly and understandably:

```
FUNCTION check_character_distribution()

    // Step 1: Read two strings from user input
    PROMPT user for the first string
    STORE the first string without spaces in variable firstString
    PROMPT user for the second string
    STORE the second string without spaces in variable secondString

    // Step 2: Initialize an array to hold frequency differences
    CREATE an array to hold frequency differences for each character, initialize all to zero
    
    // Step 3: Calculate the frequency difference for each character
    FOR each character in the range from 'A' to 'z' (inclusive):
        COUNT occurrences of current character in firstString
        COUNT occurrences of current character in secondString
        CALCULATE the difference in counts and store in the corresponding index of the frequency differences array

    // Step 4: Check if any character has a negative frequency difference
    INITIALIZE a variable to count negative differences
    FOR each frequency difference in the array:
        IF frequency difference is less than zero THEN
            INCREMENT the count of negative differences by one

    // Step 5: Determine if the character distributions are valid
    IF count of negative differences is zero THEN
        PRINT "YES"  // implying firstString can cover secondString
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"   // implying firstString cannot cover secondString

END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Key Parts:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode indicates that two strings will be read from the user, with spaces being ignored.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: It shows the process of counting character occurrences and calculating differences in frequencies based on the input strings.
3. **Check Logic**: Finally, it describes how to check if all character differences are non-negative, leading to the output of "YES" or "NO". 

This structure reflects the logic of the original code while remaining easily understandable.
