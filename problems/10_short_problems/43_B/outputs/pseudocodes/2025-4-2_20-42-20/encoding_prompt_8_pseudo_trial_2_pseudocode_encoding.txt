**Purpose:** The purpose of the code is to compare two input strings and determine if the first string can be transformed into the second string using the same characters and frequency, disregarding spaces.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Gather Input Strings:**
   - Read the first string from user input.
   - Read the second string from user input.

2. **Process Strings to Remove Spaces:**
   - Create a list called `firstString` that contains all characters from the first input string, excluding spaces.
   - Create a list called `secondString` that contains all characters from the second input string, excluding spaces.

3. **Calculate Frequency Differences:**
   - Initialize a list called `frequencyDifferences` to store the difference in character frequencies.
   - For each character code from 'A' (ASCII value 65) to 'z' (ASCII value 122):
     - Count how many times the character appears in `firstString`.
     - Count how many times the same character appears in `secondString`.
     - Calculate the difference between the counts (first minus second) and add it to `frequencyDifferences`.

4. **Determine Validity of Transformation:**
   - Check if there are any negative values in the `frequencyDifferences` list.
     - If there are no negative values, this means the first string has all necessary characters in equal or greater amounts compared to the second string.
     - If there are negative values, this means the first string cannot provide enough characters to match those needed in the second string.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - If the first string can be transformed to match the second string, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

**Comment Descriptions:**
- The processing of strings ensures that only relevant characters are counted.
- The frequency difference calculation allows for a straightforward way to assess character availability for transformation.
- The final check ensures that the transformation is possible based on character supply and demand.

By following these steps, the core logic of the original code is preserved while being presented in a more accessible format.
