**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read two lines of input from the user, representing two strings, `firstString` and `secondString`.

2. **Process Input to Remove Spaces:**
   - For each character in `firstString`, create a new list that includes the character only if it is not a space. Store this result in `processedFirstString`.
   - For each character in `secondString`, create a new list that includes the character only if it is not a space. Store this result in `processedSecondString`.

3. **Initialize Frequency Count:**
   - Create a list named `frequencyDifferences` that will hold the count of characters appearing in `processedFirstString` minus their count in `processedSecondString` for each character from 'A' to 'z'.

4. **Calculate Frequency Differences:**
   - For each character in the range from the ASCII value of 'A' to the ASCII value of 'z':
     - Count how many times this character appears in `processedFirstString`.
     - Count how many times this character appears in `processedSecondString`.
     - Subtract the second count (from `secondString`) from the first count (from `firstString`) and store the result in `frequencyDifferences`.

5. **Determine Result:**
   - Check if all values in `frequencyDifferences` are greater than or equal to zero.
     - If there are no negative values in `frequencyDifferences`, then output "YES."
     - Otherwise, output "NO." 

**Summary of Input and Output Requirements:**
- **Input:** Two strings of text (which may contain spaces).
- **Output:** A message indicating "YES" if every character from the first string appears at least as many times as in the second string, otherwise "NO."
