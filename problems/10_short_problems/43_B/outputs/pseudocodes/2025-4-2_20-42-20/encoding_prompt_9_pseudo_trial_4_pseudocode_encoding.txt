**Purpose:** The goal of the algorithm is to determine if the characters in the first input string can form the characters in the second input string without any shortage, ignoring spaces.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user for two strings of text.
   - Store the first string in a variable called `first_string`.
   - Store the second string in a variable called `second_string`.

2. **Process Input:**
   - Remove all spaces from `first_string` and store the result in `cleaned_first_string`.
   - Remove all spaces from `second_string` and store the result in `cleaned_second_string`.

3. **Initialize Frequency Count:**
   - Create a list called `character_frequencies` that will hold the difference in counts of each character between `cleaned_first_string` and `cleaned_second_string`.

4. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - For each character in the range from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count how many times that character appears in `cleaned_first_string`.
     - Count how many times that character appears in `cleaned_second_string`.
     - Calculate the difference between these two counts.
     - Store this difference in the `character_frequencies` list.

5. **Evaluate Frequencies:**
   - Create a variable called `has_shortages` and set it to 'NO'.
   - Check if there are any negative values in `character_frequencies` (indicating shortages of characters needed for the second string):
     - If there are:
       - Set `has_shortages` to 'YES'.
   
6. **Output Result:**
   - Print "YES" if `has_shortages` is 'NO' (meaning the first string can form the second string), else print "NO".

**Summary of Control Structures:**
- Use loops to iterate through character ranges and to count character occurrences.
- Use conditionals to determine if character shortages exist based on frequency counts.

**Final Note:** This pseudocode maintains clarity and abstracts from specific programming syntax to help anyone understand the core logic behind the algorithm.
