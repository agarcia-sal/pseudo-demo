### Pseudocode

1. **Input**: Read two lines of input strings: `first_string` and `second_string`. 

2. **Process the Strings**:
   - Create a list `filtered_first` by iterating over each character in `first_string` and including the character in the list only if it is not a space.
   - Create a list `filtered_second` by iterating over each character in `second_string` and including the character in the list only if it is not a space.

3. **Initialize Frequency Differences**:
   - Create a list `frequency_differences` to store the count differences of each character:
     - For each character in the ASCII range from 'A' to 'z':
       - Count how many times the character appears in `filtered_first` and subtract how many times it appears in `filtered_second`.
       - Store this difference in the list `frequency_differences`.

4. **Check for Negative Frequencies**:
   - Create a list `negative_frequencies` by checking for all elements in `frequency_differences` that are less than zero. 
   - Count the number of elements in `negative_frequencies`.

5. **Output Result**:
   - If the count of `negative_frequencies` is zero, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO". 

### Summary of Logic:
- The code checks whether every character from `first_string` appears at least as many times in `second_string`. 
- If any character from `first_string` appears fewer times in `second_string`, the output is "NO". If all characters meet the condition, the output is "YES".
