**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to compare two input strings and determine if the first string can be transformed into the second by checking the frequency of characters. Specifically, it checks if all characters in the second string are present in the first string in equal or greater amounts.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Retrieve Input:**
   - Get the first string from the user and store it in a variable called `firstString`.
   - Get the second string from the user and store it in a variable called `secondString`.

2. **Preprocess Input:**
   - Create a list called `cleanedStrings` that contains:
     - A version of `firstString` with all spaces removed.
     - A version of `secondString` with all spaces removed.
   - Assign the cleaned version of `firstString` to a variable `s1`.
   - Assign the cleaned version of `secondString` to a variable `s2`.

3. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - Initialize a list called `frequencyDifference` to store the difference in character counts.
   - For every character in the range from the ASCII value of 'A' to the ASCII value of 'z':
     - Count how many times this character appears in `s1`.
     - Count how many times this character appears in `s2`.
     - Calculate the difference by subtracting the count in `s2` from the count in `s1`.
     - Append this difference to `frequencyDifference`.

4. **Check Character Count Requirements:**
   - Count how many values in `frequencyDifference` are less than zero, indicating insufficient characters in `s1` compared to `s2`.

5. **Provide Output:**
   - If the count of negative values in `frequencyDifference` is zero, print "YES" (indicating that the transformation is possible).
   - Otherwise, print "NO" (indicating that the transformation is not possible).

By following this clear outline, we maintain the core logic and flow while ensuring the details are more accessible and understandable.
