Here is the pseudocode that clearly represents the logic of the provided code:

```
BEGIN
    // Read two lines of input, which represent two strings
    STRING firstInput = readInput()
    STRING secondInput = readInput()

    // Create two lists to hold characters from the input strings, excluding spaces
    LIST charactersFromFirstInput = createListOfCharacters(firstInput, excludeSpaces = true)
    LIST charactersFromSecondInput = createListOfCharacters(secondInput, excludeSpaces = true)

    // Initialize a list to store the frequency difference of each character
    LIST frequencyDifferences = initializeListOfSize(96) // For characters A-Z and a-z
    
    // Calculate frequency differences for each character
    FOR each characterCode FROM 65 TO 122 DO // ASCII values for A(65) to z(122)
        INT frequencyInFirstInput = countCharacterInList(charactersFromFirstInput, characterCode)
        INT frequencyInSecondInput = countCharacterInList(charactersFromSecondInput, characterCode)
        
        // Store the frequency difference
        frequencyDifferences[characterCode] = frequencyInFirstInput - frequencyInSecondInput
    END FOR

    // Check if all frequency differences are non-negative
    BOOLEAN allFrequenciesNonNegative = true
    FOR each frequency IN frequencyDifferences DO
        IF frequency < 0 THEN
            allFrequenciesNonNegative = false
            BREAK // No need to check further, we found a negative frequency
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Output the result based on frequency check
    IF allFrequenciesNonNegative THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: Two strings are read as input which represent two separate inputs.
  
2. **Character Extraction**: Each string is processed to create a list of characters, omitting any spaces.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: A list is created to store the frequency difference of each character based on their ASCII values. For each character from 'A' to 'z', the difference in counts between the two inputs is calculated.

4. **Validation**: The algorithm checks if any frequency difference is negative. If all are non-negative, it means the requirement is satisfied.

5. **Output**: Based on the check, it prints "YES" if all frequencies are non-negative, otherwise it prints "NO". 

This pseudocode encapsulates the logic of the original code while remaining comprehensible and structured for clarity.
