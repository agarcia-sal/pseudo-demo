**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Two Strings:**
   - Read the first string from user input, removing any spaces.
   - Read the second string from user input, removing any spaces.

2. **Create Character Frequency Difference:**
   - Initialize a list to hold the frequency differences of all characters from 'A' to 'z'.
   - For each character in the ASCII range from 'A' (65) to 'z' (122):
     - Count how many times that character appears in the first string (s1).
     - Count how many times that character appears in the second string (s2).
     - Calculate the difference between the counts from s1 and s2.
     - Store this difference in the list.

3. **Check for Negative Differences:**
   - Count how many differences in the list are less than zero.
   - If there are no negative differences (i.e., the count is zero):
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

**Summary:**
This algorithm decides if the frequency of every character in the first string is greater than or equal to its frequency in the second string. If all characters in the first string meet this condition, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
