```
1. Define a function to check character frequency difference between two input strings.
2. Initialize two empty lists, s1 and s2.
3. For each of the two user inputs:
   a. Read the input string.
   b. Remove all spaces from the string.
   c. Store the cleaned string in the corresponding list (s1 or s2).
4. Initialize a frequency difference list, freqs.
5. For each character code from 'A' to 'z':
   a. Calculate the difference in occurrence of the character in s1 and s2.
   b. Store this difference in the freqs list.
6. If there are no negative values in the freqs list:
   a. Output "YES".
7. Otherwise:
   a. Output "NO".
