Here is the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION compareStringsForCharacterBalance
    // INPUT: Read two strings from user
    STRING firstString = Read input from user
    STRING secondString = Read input from user
    
    // INITIALIZE: Create character lists without spaces
    LIST firstCharacterList = Create a list of characters from firstString, excluding spaces
    LIST secondCharacterList = Create a list of characters from secondString, excluding spaces

    // INITIALIZE: Create a list to store frequency differences
    LIST frequencyDifferences = Initialize an empty list to hold frequency differences

    // CALCULATE frequency differences for each character in the range A to z
    FOR each characterCode FROM ASCII value of 'A' TO ASCII value of 'z' DO
        INTEGER frequencyDifference = Count occurrences of character (characterCode) in firstCharacterList
                              - Count occurrences of character (characterCode) in secondCharacterList
        Add frequencyDifference to frequencyDifferences
    END FOR

    // CHECK: Determine if all frequency differences are non-negative
    IF Count of negative values in frequencyDifferences is equal to 0 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Operations:
1. **Input Handling**: The function begins by reading two strings from user input.
2. **Character List Creation**: It constructs lists of characters from both strings, filtering out any spaces.
3. **Frequency Calculation**: A loop iterates over the character range from 'A' to 'z' to compute how many times each character appears in the first string versus the second.
4. **Result Assessment**: The algorithm checks if there are any negative frequencies, which would indicate that the second string has more of that character than the first. Based on this check, it prints "YES" if all frequencies are non-negative, and "NO" otherwise.

This pseudocode provides a clear, structured overview of the algorithm without delving into specific programming language syntax, making it approachable for a broader audience.
