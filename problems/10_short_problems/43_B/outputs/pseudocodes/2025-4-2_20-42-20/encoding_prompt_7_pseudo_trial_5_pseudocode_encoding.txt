Here is the high-level pseudocode based on the provided code:

```
FUNCTION checkCharacterFrequency
    PROMPT user for first string input
    STORE user input as firstString
    PROMPT user for second string input
    STORE user input as secondString

    INITIALIZE firstFilteredList as a list of characters from firstString excluding spaces
    INITIALIZE secondFilteredList as a list of characters from secondString excluding spaces

    INITIALIZE frequencyDifferenceList as an empty list

    FOR each ASCII value from 'A' to 'z' DO
        CALCULATE the frequency difference for the current character
        frequencyDifference = count of current character in firstFilteredList minus count in secondFilteredList
        ADD frequencyDifference to frequencyDifferenceList
    END FOR

    IF there are no negative values in frequencyDifferenceList THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `checkCharacterFrequency` is designed to check if the frequency of characters in the first input string is at least as much as in the second input string, ignoring spaces.

2. **Input**: The function prompts the user for two string inputs.

3. **Processing Strings**: 
    - It filters out spaces from both strings and stores the resulting characters in two separate lists.
    - For each character represented by ASCII values between 'A' and 'z', it calculates the frequency difference in the two lists and stores these differences in `frequencyDifferenceList`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it assesses the contents of `frequencyDifferenceList`. If all values are non-negative, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". 

This structured approach captures the main logic while ensuring clarity and high abstraction suitable for a variety of audiences.
