**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Take two lines of input from the user. Each line represents a string.
   - Remove any spaces from both input strings, resulting in two new strings: `cleanedString1` and `cleanedString2`.

2. **Initialize Frequency List:**
   - Create an empty list called `frequencyDifferences` to store the differences in character counts.

3. **Calculate Frequency Differences:**
   - For each character represented by the ASCII values from 'A' (65) to 'z' (122):
     - Count how many times this character appears in `cleanedString1`.
     - Count how many times this character appears in `cleanedString2`.
     - Calculate the difference by subtracting the count from `cleanedString2` from the count from `cleanedString1`.
     - Store this difference in the `frequencyDifferences` list.

4. **Check for Negative Differences:**
   - Create a new list that includes only the elements from `frequencyDifferences` that are less than zero.
   - If this new list has no elements (meaning there are no negative differences):
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

**Input Specifications:**
- Two strings provided by the user, potentially containing spaces.

**Output Specifications:**
- Print "YES" if all character counts in the first string are greater than or equal to those in the second string.
- Print "NO" if any character in the second string has a higher count than in the first string.
