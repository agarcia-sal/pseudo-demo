**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to compare two input strings and determine if all characters in the first string either match or exceed the frequency of the corresponding characters in the second string.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Obtain two strings from the user (let's call them firstString and secondString).

2. **Process Input Strings:**
   - For each input string:
     - Create a new version of the string that removes all spaces.
     - Assign the processed version of the first input to `firstProcessed`.
     - Assign the processed version of the second input to `secondProcessed`.

3. **Initialize Frequency List:**
   - Create a list called `frequencyDifference` to hold the frequency differences of each character from 'A' to 'z'.

4. **Calculate Character Frequencies:**
   - For each character (using its ASCII values from 'A' to 'z'):
     - Count how many times the character appears in `firstProcessed`.
     - Count how many times the character appears in `secondProcessed`.
     - Calculate the difference between the count from `firstProcessed` and `secondProcessed`.
     - Store this difference in `frequencyDifference`.

5. **Check Conditions:**
   - Count how many values in `frequencyDifference` are negative (indicating that `secondProcessed` has more of that character than `firstProcessed`).
   - If there are no negative values:
     - Print "YES" (indicating all characters in `firstProcessed` meet or exceed the counts in `secondProcessed`).
   - Else:
     - Print "NO" (indicating some characters in `secondProcessed` exceed those in `firstProcessed`).

**End of Pseudocode** 

This pseudocode effectively captures the essence of the original code by outlining its logic and flow in an approachable manner while avoiding programming-specific syntax.
