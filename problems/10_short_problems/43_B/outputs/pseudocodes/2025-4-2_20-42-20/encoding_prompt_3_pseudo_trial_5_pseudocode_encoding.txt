Certainly! Below is a structured and clear pseudocode representation of the given code snippet:

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Step 2: Remove spaces from both lines
    SET cleanedFirstLine AS List of characters from firstLine without spaces
    SET cleanedSecondLine AS List of characters from secondLine without spaces

    // Step 3: Initialize frequency difference list
    SET frequencyDifferences AS an empty list

    // Step 4: Calculate the character frequency differences
    FOR each character ASCII value from 'A' to 'z'
        SET character AS the character corresponding to the current ASCII value
        COUNT occurrences of character in cleanedFirstLine AS countInFirstLine
        COUNT occurrences of character in cleanedSecondLine AS countInSecondLine
        CALCULATE difference AS countInFirstLine - countInSecondLine
        APPEND difference to frequencyDifferences
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Check if all frequency differences are non-negative
    SET hasNegativeDifference AS False

    FOR each value in frequencyDifferences
        IF value is less than 0 THEN
            SET hasNegativeDifference AS True
            BREAK the loop
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Print result based on the frequency differences
    IF hasNegativeDifference is False THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF

END
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode:**

- The pseudocode begins with reading two lines of input.
- It then cleans both lines to remove spaces and stores the characters.
- A list is initialized to store the frequency differences of characters from the first and the second cleaned list.
- For each character in a specified range, the code counts how many times it appears in both lists and calculates the difference.
- It checks if any of the differences is negative; if found, it breaks out of the loop early.
- Finally, it prints "YES" if all differences are non-negative, otherwise it prints "NO".

This structured presentation and clear explanations make the underlying logic easily understandable!
