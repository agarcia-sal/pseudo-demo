Here is a clear and understandable pseudocode that represents the logic of the original code:

```
START

// Step 1: Read two strings from user input
Input firstString
Input secondString

// Step 2: Remove spaces from both strings
Remove spaces from firstString
Remove spaces from secondString

// Step 3: Initialize a frequency list to store counts of character differences
Create a list called characterFrequency with size equal to the number of ASCII characters

// Step 4: Calculate the frequency of each character
FOR each character in the range from 'A' to 'z' (inclusive):
    // Count occurrences of the character in both strings
    countInFirstString = count occurrences of character in firstString
    countInSecondString = count occurrences of character in secondString
    
    // Calculate the difference in counts and store it in characterFrequency
    characterFrequency[character] = countInFirstString - countInSecondString

// Step 5: Check if all frequency differences are non-negative
Create a variable called isValid with a default value of TRUE

FOR each count in characterFrequency:
    IF count < 0 THEN
        Set isValid to FALSE
        BREAK // No need to check further, exit loop

// Step 6: Output result based on validity check
IF isValid is TRUE THEN
    Print "YES"
ELSE
    Print "NO"

END
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode begins with a clear instruction set for reading input strings.
- It describes the process of removing spaces and setting up a list to track frequency differences in character counts.
- A loop calculates the frequency of each character from both strings and assesses the differences.
- Finally, it determines if all differences are non-negative and prints the appropriate response. This structured approach helps convey the algorithm's logic without relying on specific programming syntax.
