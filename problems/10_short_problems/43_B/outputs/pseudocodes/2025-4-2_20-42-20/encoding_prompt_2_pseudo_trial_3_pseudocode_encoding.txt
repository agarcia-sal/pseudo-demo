**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input**: Accept two strings of characters from the user. These strings are referred to as `stringOne` and `stringTwo`.
   
2. **Process the Strings**:
   - Create a list called `filteredStringOne` that contains all characters from `stringOne`, excluding any spaces.
   - Create a list called `filteredStringTwo` that contains all characters from `stringTwo`, excluding any spaces.

3. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - Initialize a list named `frequencyDifference` to keep track of the differences in character counts between the two filtered strings.
   - For each character represented by its ASCII value from 'A' to 'z':
     - Calculate how many times that character appears in `filteredStringOne`.
     - Calculate how many times that character appears in `filteredStringTwo`.
     - Determine the difference between these two counts (count in `stringOne` minus count in `stringTwo`) and store this value in `frequencyDifference`.

4. **Check Frequency Conditions**:
   - Create a new list called `negativeCounts` that contains all values from `frequencyDifference` that are less than zero.
   - If `negativeCounts` is empty (meaning there are no negative differences), then the output should be "YES".
   - If `negativeCounts` is not empty, then the output should be "NO".

5. **Output**: Display the result based on the condition checked in the previous step.
