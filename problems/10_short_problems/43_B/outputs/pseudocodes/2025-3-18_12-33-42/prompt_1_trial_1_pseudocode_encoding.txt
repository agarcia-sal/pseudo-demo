**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input:**
   - Read a line of text from the user and store it as `firstString`.
   - Read another line of text from the user and store it as `secondString`.

2. **Prepare Strings:**
   - Create a list `cleanedFirstString` that contains all characters from `firstString` except spaces.
   - Create a list `cleanedSecondString` that contains all characters from `secondString` except spaces.

3. **Initialize Frequency Difference List:**
   - Create an empty list called `frequencyDifferences`.

4. **Calculate Frequency Differences:**
   - For each character ASCII value from 65 (representing 'A') to 122 (representing 'z'):
     - Count how many times this character appears in `cleanedFirstString` and in `cleanedSecondString`.
     - Calculate the difference in counts (count in `cleanedFirstString` minus count in `cleanedSecondString`) and append this value to `frequencyDifferences`.

5. **Check Conditions:**
   - Count how many values in `frequencyDifferences` are less than zero.
   - If the count of negative values is zero:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

**Output Explanation:**
- The program checks if all characters from the first input string are present in equal or higher frequency in the second input string, ignoring spaces. If this is true, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
