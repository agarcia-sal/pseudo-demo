```pseudocode
// Step 1: Read two input strings from the user, stripping out any whitespace
INPUT string1 FROM user
INPUT string2 FROM user

// Step 2: Create a list of characters without spaces for both strings
CREATE list charactersFromString1 AS list of characters from string1 without spaces
CREATE list charactersFromString2 AS list of characters from string2 without spaces

// Step 3: Initialize a frequency list to store the difference in character counts
INITIALIZE list frequencyDifferences WITH zeroes for every character from 'A' to 'z'

// Step 4: Calculate the frequency differences for each character
FOR each character code from ASCII value of 'A' to ASCII value of 'z'
    SET countInFirstString TO the count of this character in charactersFromString1
    SET countInSecondString TO the count of this character in charactersFromString2
    SET frequencyDifferences at this character code TO (countInFirstString - countInSecondString)

// Step 5: Check if all frequency differences are non-negative
INITIALIZE list negativeFrequencies AS an empty list
FOR each frequency in frequencyDifferences
    IF frequency < 0 THEN
        ADD frequency to negativeFrequencies

// Step 6: Determine the result based on the counts of negative frequencies
IF size of negativeFrequencies is 0 THEN
    OUTPUT "YES"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "NO"
``` 

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
- The pseudocode begins by obtaining two strings from the user while removing spaces to ensure accurate comparisons.
- It creates lists to store the characters from both input strings and initializes a list for tracking frequency differences of characters.
- The program calculates how many times each character appears in both strings and finds the difference, storing these values in a list.
- Finally, it checks if there are any characters with negative frequency differences and outputs "YES" if all characters are sufficiently present in the first string or "NO" otherwise.
