**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Phase:**
   - Read two lines of input, referred to as `first_line` and `second_line`.
   - Remove any spaces from each line to create two new strings, `string1` and `string2`.

2. **Frequency Calculation Phase:**
   - Initialize an empty list called `frequency_differences`.
   - Loop through the range of character codes from the code for 'A' (uppercase A) to the code for 'z' (lowercase z):
     - For each character code in this range:
       - Convert the character code to its corresponding character.
       - Count how many times this character appears in `string1`.
       - Count how many times this character appears in `string2`.
       - Calculate the difference between the count in `string1` and the count in `string2`.
       - Add the difference to the `frequency_differences` list.

3. **Result Evaluation Phase:**
   - Check if there are no negative values in the `frequency_differences` list:
     - If there are no negative values, output "YES".
     - If there is at least one negative value, output "NO". 

**Summary of Logic:**
The program checks whether the number of occurrences of each character from 'A' to 'z' in the first input line is greater than or equal to the number of occurrences in the second input line. The output will indicate if this condition holds true for all characters.
