**Purpose:** The code compares two input strings to determine if the second string can be constructed using the characters from the first string, accounting for character frequencies. It outputs "YES" if it can, and "NO" otherwise.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Get the first input string (let's call it `firstString`).
   - Get the second input string (let's call it `secondString`).

2. **Process Strings:**
   - Remove all spaces from `firstString` and `secondString`.
   - Store the processed first string in a variable called `processedFirst`.
   - Store the processed second string in a variable called `processedSecond`.

3. **Initialize Frequency Count:**
   - Create an empty list called `frequencyDifferences` to hold the differences in character counts.

4. **Character Frequency Calculation:**
   - For each character (from 'A' to 'z'):
     - Count how many times this character appears in `processedFirst` (let's call this `firstCount`).
     - Count how many times this character appears in `processedSecond` (let's call this `secondCount`).
     - Calculate the difference between `firstCount` and `secondCount`.
     - Append this difference to `frequencyDifferences`.

5. **Evaluate Results:**
   - Count how many values in `frequencyDifferences` are negative. This indicates that there are characters in `processedSecond` which are absent or less frequent in `processedFirst`.
   - If there are no negative values:
     - Output "YES" (indicates `secondString` can be constructed using characters from `firstString`).
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO" (indicates `secondString` cannot be constructed using characters from `firstString`).

**Example Structure of Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main
    firstString = INPUT("Enter first string:")
    secondString = INPUT("Enter second string:")
    
    processedFirst = REMOVE_SPACES(firstString)
    processedSecond = REMOVE_SPACES(secondString)
    
    frequencyDifferences = []
    
    FOR each character FROM 'A' TO 'z' DO
        firstCount = COUNT(character IN processedFirst)
        secondCount = COUNT(character IN processedSecond)
        difference = firstCount - secondCount
        ADD difference TO frequencyDifferences
    END FOR
    
    negativeCount = COUNT(negative VALUES IN frequencyDifferences)
    
    IF negativeCount EQUALS 0 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Notes:**
- The pseudocode abstracts away specific programming syntax while maintaining the original logic's clarity.
- Each vital step is clearly laid out, enabling easy understanding without previous programming knowledge.
- Comments or descriptive phrases clarify the purpose of various sections and variables used.
