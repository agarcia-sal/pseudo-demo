**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to compare the frequency of each character in two input strings, ignoring spaces, and determine if the first string contains at least as many occurrences of each character as the second string.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user for the first string of characters and store it as `firstString`.
   - Prompt the user for the second string of characters and store it as `secondString`.

2. **Prepare Strings:**
   - Create a list called `charactersInFirst` that contains all characters from `firstString`, excluding any spaces.
   - Create a list called `charactersInSecond` that contains all characters from `secondString`, excluding any spaces.

3. **Calculate Frequency Differences:**
   - Create a list called `characterFrequencyDifference`.
   - For each character in the range of uppercase 'A' (65) to lowercase 'z' (122):
     - Count how many times that character appears in `charactersInFirst`.
     - Count how many times that character appears in `charactersInSecond`.
     - Compute the difference between the count in `charactersInFirst` and the count in `charactersInSecond`, and add this difference to `characterFrequencyDifference`.

4. **Determine Output:**
   - Check the list `characterFrequencyDifference` to see if there are any negative values (indicating `charactersInSecond` has more of a character than `charactersInFirst`).
   - If there are no negative values:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

**Summary of Flow:**
- The program prompts for two inputs, processes them to exclude spaces, counts character frequencies, and compares the frequencies between the two strings to output an affirmation or negation based on these comparisons.
