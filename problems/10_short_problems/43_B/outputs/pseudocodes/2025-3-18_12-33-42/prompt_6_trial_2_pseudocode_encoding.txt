Here is the pseudocode based on the provided code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Get two lines of input, each representing a string
    INPUT string1
    INPUT string2

    // Process the input strings to remove spaces and store them in a list
    FOR each character in string1
        IF character is not a space THEN
            ADD character to list string1_processed
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    FOR each character in string2
        IF character is not a space THEN
            ADD character to list string2_processed
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Initialize a list to keep track of frequency differences
    INITIALIZE frequency_differences as an empty list

    // Calculate the difference in character frequencies between the two strings
    FOR character_code FROM ASCII value of 'A' TO ASCII value of 'z'
        frequency_in_string1 = COUNT occurrence of character_code in string1_processed
        frequency_in_string2 = COUNT occurrence of character_code in string2_processed
        difference = frequency_in_string1 - frequency_in_string2
        ADD difference to frequency_differences
    ENDFOR

    // Check if there are any negative frequency differences
    IF there are no negative values in frequency_differences THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Input Section**: The algorithm takes two strings as input from the user, one at a time.
- **Processing Section**: Each string is processed to remove any spaces, creating two lists containing the individual characters.
- **Frequency Calculation**: The algorithm calculates how many times each letter (from 'A' to 'z') appears in both lists and computes the difference for each character.
- **Output Section**: The program checks if all frequency differences are non-negative. If they are, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". 

This pseudocode structure delineates the flow of logic and serves to explain the functionality clearly without the intricacies of programming language syntax.
