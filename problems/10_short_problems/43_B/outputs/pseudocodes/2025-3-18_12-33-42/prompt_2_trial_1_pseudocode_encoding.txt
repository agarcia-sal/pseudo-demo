**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Take two lines of input from the user, representing two separate strings: `firstInput` and `secondInput`.

2. **Process Strings:**
   - For each input string:
     - Remove all spaces from the string to create `processedFirstString` and `processedSecondString`.

3. **Calculate Frequency Differences:**
   - Initialize a list called `frequencyDifferences`.
   - For each character code from the ASCII value of 'A' to the ASCII value of 'z':
     - Determine the character corresponding to the current code.
     - Count how many times this character appears in `processedFirstString`.
     - Count how many times this character appears in `processedSecondString`.
     - Calculate the difference between the counts from `processedFirstString` and `processedSecondString`, and store this difference in `frequencyDifferences`.

4. **Check for Negative Differences:**
   - Count how many elements in `frequencyDifferences` are less than zero. This represents the number of characters that appear more frequently in `processedSecondString` than in `processedFirstString`.

5. **Output Result:**
   - If there are no negative differences (i.e., the count is zero):
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO". 

This pseudocode captures the logic of comparing the frequencies of characters from the two input strings after removing spaces and determines if one string can be viewed as having an equal or greater frequency of all characters compared to the other.
