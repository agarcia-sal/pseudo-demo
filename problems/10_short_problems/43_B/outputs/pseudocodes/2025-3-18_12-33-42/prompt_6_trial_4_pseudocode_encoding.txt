**Pseudocode**

```plaintext
FUNCTION main
    // Read two input strings, representing two different sets of characters
    INPUT firstString
    INPUT secondString
    
    // Remove all spaces from each string and save the results in two lists
    SET cleanedFirstString TO list of characters from firstString without spaces
    SET cleanedSecondString TO list of characters from secondString without spaces
    
    // Initialize a frequency list to track the differences in character counts between the two strings
    SET frequencyDifference TO an empty list

    // LOOP through each character code from 'A' (65) to 'z' (122)
    FOR each characterCode FROM 65 TO 122 DO
        // COUNT occurrences of the character in the first string
        SET countInFirstString TO number of occurrences of character represented by characterCode in cleanedFirstString
        // COUNT occurrences of the character in the second string
        SET countInSecondString TO number of occurrences of character represented by characterCode in cleanedSecondString
        
        // CALCULATE the difference in counts and add to frequencyDifference list
        SET countDifference TO countInFirstString - countInSecondString
        APPEND countDifference to frequencyDifference
    END FOR

    // CHECK if there are any negative differences in the frequencyDifference list
    SET negativeCount TO number of elements in frequencyDifference that are less than 0

    // OUTPUT result based on the condition
    IF negativeCount EQUALS 0 THEN
        PRINT "YES"    // If there are no negative counts, print YES
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"     // If there are negative counts, print NO
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode
1. **Inputs**: The process begins by reading two strings from input, which represent character sets that will be compared.
2. **Cleaning Data**: Spaces are removed from these strings, resulting in two cleaned lists of characters.
3. **Counting Frequencies**: For each character from 'A' to 'z', the algorithm counts how many times that character appears in both cleaned strings and calculates the difference in frequency.
4. **Checking Differences**: It checks if any character has a higher frequency in the second string than in the first. If so, the result will indicate that it is not possible to transform the first string into the second string using certain rules.
5. **Output**: Based on whether all frequencies are non-negative, the algorithm outputs "YES" or "NO". 

This high-level representation ensures that someone unfamiliar with the specific programming syntax can still understand the core logic and flow of the algorithm.
