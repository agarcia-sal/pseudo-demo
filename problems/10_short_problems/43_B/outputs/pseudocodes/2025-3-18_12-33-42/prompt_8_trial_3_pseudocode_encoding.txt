**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to determine if one input string can be transformed into another by comparing the frequency of characters, disregarding spaces.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Function: CompareStringFrequencies**  
   This function checks if two input strings can match character by character after adjusting their frequencies.

2. **Step 1: Read Input**  
   - PROMPT the user for two input strings.
   - STORE the first string in a variable called `firstString`.
   - STORE the second string in a variable called `secondString`.

3. **Step 2: Clean Input**  
   - REMOVE all spaces from `firstString` and STORE the result in `cleanedFirstString`.
   - REMOVE all spaces from `secondString` and STORE the result in `cleanedSecondString`.

4. **Step 3: Create Frequency Difference List**  
   - INITIALIZE an empty list called `frequencyDifferences`.
   - FOR each character represented by its ASCII value from 65 (A) to 122 (z):
     - COUNT how many times this character appears in `cleanedFirstString` and STORE the count in `firstCount`.
     - COUNT how many times this character appears in `cleanedSecondString` and STORE the count in `secondCount`.
     - CALCULATE the difference as `firstCount - secondCount`.
     - APPEND this difference to `frequencyDifferences`.

5. **Step 4: Check for Negative Frequencies**  
   - INITIALIZE a counter called `negativeCount` to 0.
   - FOR each value in `frequencyDifferences`:
     - IF the value is less than 0:
       - INCREMENT `negativeCount` by 1.

6. **Step 5: Determine Result**  
   - IF `negativeCount` is equal to 0:
     - OUTPUT "YES" indicating that the two strings can match in character frequency.
   - ELSE:
     - OUTPUT "NO" indicating a mismatch in character frequency.

**Example Explanation**:
- If the input strings are "Hello World" and "World Hello", after removing spaces, both become "HelloWorld".
- The function will compare the frequency of each character and return "YES" since they have matching frequencies.

**Comments**: 
- The function effectively disregards spaces, which allows a direct comparison between the significant characters in the two strings. 
- The use of counting and frequency difference is crucial to determine if the characters can be rearranged to match one another.
