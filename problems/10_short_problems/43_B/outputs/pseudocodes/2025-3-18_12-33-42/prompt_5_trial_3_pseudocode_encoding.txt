**Objective:** The purpose of this code is to compare the character frequencies of two input strings and determine if the first string can be rearranged to match the second string, ignoring spaces.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:** 
   - Read the first input string and store it in a variable called `firstString`.
   - Read the second input string and store it in a variable called `secondString`.

2. **Remove Spaces:** 
   - Create a list of characters called `cleanedFirstString` from `firstString` that contains only the non-space characters.
   - Create a list of characters called `cleanedSecondString` from `secondString` that contains only the non-space characters.

3. **Initialize Frequency Count:**
   - Create a list called `frequencyDifference` to hold frequency counts for each letter (from 'A' to 'z').

4. **Calculate Frequencies:**
   - For each character in the range of ASCII values from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count how many times that character appears in `cleanedFirstString` and how many times it appears in `cleanedSecondString`.
     - Calculate the difference in counts (i.e., count in `cleanedFirstString` minus count in `cleanedSecondString`) and store this in `frequencyDifference`.

5. **Check Feasibility:**
   - Create a list called `negativeCounts` that contains all the negative values from `frequencyDifference`.
   - If the number of negative values in `negativeCounts` is zero, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

**Detailed Steps:**

- **Input Collection:**
  - Input firstString: Capture the input from the user.
  - Input secondString: Capture the second input from the user.

- **Filtering Characters:**
  - For firstString, iterate through each character and check if it is not a space. If yes, add it to cleanedFirstString.
  - For secondString, iterate through each character and check if it is not a space. If yes, add it to cleanedSecondString.

- **Counting Frequencies:**
  - For each ASCII character from 'A' (ASCII 65) to 'z' (ASCII 122):
    - Calculate the count of each character in cleanedFirstString and cleanedSecondString.
    - Compute the difference and store it in frequencyDifference.

- **Output Result:**
  - Check the contents of frequencyDifference for negative values.
  - If there are no negative values, print "YES".
  - If there are any negative values, print "NO".

**Comments:**
- This pseudocode clearly explains each step and the important operations without using technical syntax, making it accessible for readers with varying levels of programming knowledge.
