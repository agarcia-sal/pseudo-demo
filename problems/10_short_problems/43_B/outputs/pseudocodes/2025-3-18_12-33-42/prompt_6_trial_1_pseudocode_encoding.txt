**Pseudocode**

```
FUNCTION CheckCharacterFrequency()

    // Step 1: Read two input strings from the user
    INPUT firstString
    INPUT secondString
    
    // Step 2: Remove all spaces from both input strings
    firstCleanedString = RemoveSpacesFromString(firstString)
    secondCleanedString = RemoveSpacesFromString(secondString)

    // Step 3: Initialize a list to hold the frequency difference of characters
    characterFrequencyDifference = []

    // Step 4: Iterate through the ASCII values of uppercase and lowercase letters
    FOR each ASCII value from 'A' (65) to 'z' (122) DO
        
        // Step 5: Count the occurrences of the character in both cleaned strings
        character = ConvertASCIIToCharacter(ASCII value)
        countInFirstString = CountOccurrences(firstCleanedString, character)
        countInSecondString = CountOccurrences(secondCleanedString, character)

        // Step 6: Calculate the frequency difference and store it in the list
        difference = countInFirstString - countInSecondString
        Append difference to characterFrequencyDifference

    END FOR

    // Step 7: Check if there are any negative differences
    negativeDifferencesCount = CountElementsLessThanZero(characterFrequencyDifference)

    // Step 8: Output the result based on the negative differences count
    IF negativeDifferencesCount == 0 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

### Explanation of the Pseudocode
1. **Function Definition**: The pseudocode begins with a main function that encapsulates the logic.
2. **Input Handling**: It reads two strings from the user and processes them to remove spaces.
3. **Frequency Calculation**: It calculates how many more times each character appears in the first string than in the second.
4. **Condition Checking**: It checks if there are any characters that are in excess in the first string, indicating whether the condition allows a “YES” or “NO” answer.
5. **Helper Functions**: Additional functions are clearly defined to help modularize the code and clarify each task being performed. 

This structured approach makes it easier to understand the algorithm without getting into specific programming language syntax.
