**Purpose:** The code compares two input strings to determine if the second string can be obtained from the first string by using each character at most as many times as they appear in the first string. It outputs "YES" if this is possible and "NO" otherwise.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first string and store it as `firstString`.
   - Prompt again for the second string and store it as `secondString`.

2. **Process Input Strings:**
   - Remove all spaces from `firstString` and `secondString`:
     - Create `cleanedFirstString` which is a list of characters from `firstString` without spaces.
     - Create `cleanedSecondString` which is a list of characters from `secondString` without spaces.

3. **Initialize Frequency List:**
   - Create a list called `characterFrequency` with a size sufficient to cover all characters from 'A' to 'z'. Initialize all elements to zero.

4. **Calculate Character Frequencies:**
   - For each character in `cleanedFirstString`:
     - Count occurrences of the character and increase the corresponding index in `characterFrequency`.
   - For each character in `cleanedSecondString`:
     - Count occurrences of the character and decrease the corresponding index in `characterFrequency`.

5. **Check Character Frequencies:**
   - Count how many elements in `characterFrequency` are negative. This indicates characters in `secondString` exceed their occurrences in `firstString`.

6. **Output Result:**
   - If no elements in `characterFrequency` are negative (meaning all characters in `secondString` can be formed from those in `firstString`), print "YES".
   - If there are any negative elements, print "NO".

**Comments:**
- Each character from 'A' to 'z' is represented by its ASCII value, and the operations on the list of frequencies reflect the difference between the characters in the first string and the second string.
- The process systematically checks if all characters in the second string can be constructed with the available characters from the first string, accounting for the quantity of each character.
