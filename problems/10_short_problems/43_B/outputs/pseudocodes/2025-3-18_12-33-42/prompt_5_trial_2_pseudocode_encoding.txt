**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to compare two user-provided strings and determine if all characters in the first string are either present or in greater quantity than in the second string.

### Pseudocode:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read two lines of text input
    PROMPT user for first string
    STORE first string in variable first_string
    
    PROMPT user for second string
    STORE second string in variable second_string
    
    // Step 2: Remove spaces from both strings
    SET cleaned_first_string to an empty list
    SET cleaned_second_string to an empty list
    
    FOR each character in first_string
        IF character is not a space THEN
            ADD character to cleaned_first_string
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    FOR each character in second_string
        IF character is not a space THEN
            ADD character to cleaned_second_string
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Step 3: Initialize frequency difference list
    SET freq_difference to an empty list

    // Step 4: Calculate the frequency difference of characters
    FOR each character in the range from 'A' to 'z'
        COUNT occurrences of character in cleaned_first_string
        STORE count_first in variable count_first
        
        COUNT occurrences of character in cleaned_second_string
        STORE count_second in variable count_second
        
        CALCULATE frequency difference as count_first - count_second
        ADD frequency difference to freq_difference
    ENDFOR

    // Step 5: Check if all frequency differences are non-negative
    SET has_negative_difference to FALSE
    
    FOR each difference in freq_difference
        IF difference is less than 0 THEN
            SET has_negative_difference to TRUE
            BREAK the loop
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Step 6: Print the result
    IF has_negative_difference is FALSE THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF

END
```

### Explanation:

- **Input Phase**: The program prompts the user to input two strings, one at a time. Spaces are removed from both strings to focus only on the significant characters.
- **Frequency Calculation Phase**: The program calculates how many more times each character appears in the first string compared to the second string. This is done by comparing each character's count.
- **Validation Phase**: It checks if any character appears more in the second string than in the first. If all characters in the first string are present equally or in greater number, it confirms with a "YES", otherwise it responds with a "NO".
