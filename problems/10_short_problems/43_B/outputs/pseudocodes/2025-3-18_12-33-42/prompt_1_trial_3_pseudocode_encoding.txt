**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input:**
   - Read the first string from user input and store it as `firstString`.
   - Read the second string from user input and store it as `secondString`.

2. **Process Strings:**
   - Create a list `cleanedFirstString` consisting of characters from `firstString` that are not spaces.
   - Create a list `cleanedSecondString` consisting of characters from `secondString` that are not spaces.

3. **Initialize Frequency List:**
   - Create a list `frequencyDifference` to hold the difference in character frequencies.
   - For each character code from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count how many times the character appears in `cleanedFirstString`.
     - Count how many times the character appears in `cleanedSecondString`.
     - Calculate the difference between the counts from `cleanedFirstString` and `cleanedSecondString`.
     - Add this difference to `frequencyDifference`.

4. **Check Frequency Differences:**
   - Count how many values in `frequencyDifference` are negative (i.e., less than zero).
   - If there are no negative values:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO". 

This pseudocode captures the logic of checking whether the first string has at least as many occurrences of each character compared to the second string, ignoring spaces.
