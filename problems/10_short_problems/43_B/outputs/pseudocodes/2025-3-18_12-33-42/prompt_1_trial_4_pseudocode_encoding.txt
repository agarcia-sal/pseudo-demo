**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Reading:**
   - Read a line of text and store it in `firstLine`.
   - Read another line of text and store it in `secondLine`.

2. **Character Filtering:**
   - Remove all spaces from `firstLine` and store the result in `filteredFirstLine`.
   - Remove all spaces from `secondLine` and store the result in `filteredSecondLine`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Initialize a list called `frequencyDifferences` to keep track of character count differences.
   - For each character code from the ASCII value of 'A' to the ASCII value of 'z':
     - Convert the character code back to a character.
     - Count the occurrences of that character in `filteredFirstLine` and in `filteredSecondLine`.
     - Subtract the count of the character in `secondLine` from the count in `firstLine` and store the result in `frequencyDifferences`.

4. **Determine Result:**
   - Check if there are any negative values in `frequencyDifferences`:
     - If no negative values are found (meaning all characters in `firstLine` have at least as many occurrences in `secondLine`), print "YES".
     - Otherwise, print "NO".

**End of Pseudocode** 

This pseudocode captures the overall structure and logic of the algorithm, focusing on the processes of reading input, filtering spaces, counting character occurrences, and generating the final output based on the conditions.
