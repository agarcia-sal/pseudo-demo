1. Start by requesting two lines of input from the user. Each line represents a string, which will be processed to remove any spaces.

2. Store the processed strings in two separate variables: one for the first input and another for the second input.

3. Create a list, named frequencyDifference, that will store the difference in the count of each character for the character set ranging from 'A' to 'z':
   - For each character in the specified range, calculate how many times it appears in the first string and how many times it appears in the second string.
   - Subtract the count of occurrences in the second string from the count in the first string, and save this result in the frequencyDifference list.

4. Assess the computed frequencyDifference list:
   - Check if there are any elements in this list that are less than zero. These elements indicate that specific characters appear more frequently in the second string than in the first.

5. If there are no elements less than zero, output "YES", signifying that the first string has an equal or greater count of every character compared to the second string. If there are any such elements, output "NO", indicating that the second string surpasses the first in some character counts.
