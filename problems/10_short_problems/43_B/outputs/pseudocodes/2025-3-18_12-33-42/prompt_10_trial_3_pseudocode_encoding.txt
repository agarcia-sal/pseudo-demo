Here is the pseudocode for the provided code, structured clearly while incorporating the guided steps:

```pseudocode
// Step 1: Start the program
BEGIN

    // Step 2: Initialize empty lists for processed input
    DECLARE stringList1 AS LIST
    DECLARE stringList2 AS LIST

    // Step 3: Take two input strings from the user
    SET inputString1 TO GET USER INPUT
    SET inputString2 TO GET USER INPUT

    // Step 4: Process each input string to remove spaces and store the results
    FOR EACH character IN inputString1 DO
        IF character IS NOT EQUAL TO ' ' THEN
            APPEND character TO stringList1
        END IF
    END FOR

    FOR EACH character IN inputString2 DO
        IF character IS NOT EQUAL TO ' ' THEN
            APPEND character TO stringList2
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Initialize frequency difference list
    DECLARE frequencyDifferences AS LIST

    // Step 6: Calculate frequency differences for each character from 'A' to 'z'
    FOR value FROM ASCII VALUE OF 'A' TO ASCII VALUE OF 'z' DO
        SET countInList1 TO COUNT occurrences OF value IN stringList1
        SET countInList2 TO COUNT occurrences OF value IN stringList2
        APPEND (countInList1 - countInList2) TO frequencyDifferences
    END FOR

    // Step 7: Check if all frequency differences are non-negative
    SET isAllNonNegative TO TRUE

    FOR EACH frequency IN frequencyDifferences DO
        IF frequency IS LESS THAN 0 THEN
            SET isAllNonNegative TO FALSE
            BREAK
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 8: Print the result based on frequency checks
    IF isAllNonNegative IS TRUE THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation of Components:
1. **Input Collection**: The program requests two lines of input from the user.
2. **Space Removal**: It processes these strings to create two lists that exclude spaces.
3. **Frequency Calculation**: The program computes the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'z' in both lists and calculates the difference.
4. **Validation**: It checks if all frequency differences are non-negative (indicating no under-representation in the second list compared to the first).
5. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" if all differences are non-negative or "NO" otherwise.

### Assumptions:
- The input consists of valid strings from which spaces need to be removed.
- Characters are in the ASCII range from 'A' to 'z', allowing counting of all letters.
- The counting function can handle the list data structure used for storing characters.
