Below is the pseudocode that translates the given code while adhering to the structured language concepts outlined in the steps:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Input two strings from the user
    DECLARE inputString1 AS STRING
    DECLARE inputString2 AS STRING
    DISPLAY "Enter first string:"
    READ inputString1
    DISPLAY "Enter second string:"
    READ inputString2
    
    // Step 2: Remove spaces from both strings and store in s1 and s2
    DECLARE s1 AS STRING
    DECLARE s2 AS STRING
    SET s1 TO REMOVE_SPACES(inputString1)
    SET s2 TO REMOVE_SPACES(inputString2)

    // Function to remove spaces from a string
    FUNCTION REMOVE_SPACES(inputString AS STRING) RETURNS STRING
        DECLARE result AS STRING
        SET result TO ""
        FOR EACH character IN inputString DO
            IF character IS NOT ' ' THEN
                APPEND character TO result
            END IF
        END FOR
        RETURN result
    END FUNCTION

    // Step 3: Calculate frequency differences for ASCII values of characters
    DECLARE freqs AS LIST OF INTEGER
    SET freqs TO CREATE_LIST_OF_ZEROES(SIZE_OF_ASCII_RANGE)
    
    // Initialize the frequency count for A to z (65 to 122 in ASCII)
    FOR x FROM ASCII_A TO ASCII_z DO
        SET freqs[x] TO COUNT_CHARACTER(s1, x) - COUNT_CHARACTER(s2, x)
    END FOR

    // Function to count occurrences of a character in a string
    FUNCTION COUNT_CHARACTER(inputString AS STRING, asciiVal AS INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
        DECLARE count AS INTEGER
        SET count TO 0
        DECLARE character AS CHAR
        SET character TO CHAR_FROM_ASCII(asciiVal)
        FOR EACH char IN inputString DO
            IF char IS character THEN
                INCREMENT count BY 1
            END IF
        END FOR
        RETURN count
    END FUNCTION

    // Step 4: Check if there are any negative frequencies
    DECLARE allNonNegative AS BOOLEAN
    SET allNonNegative TO TRUE
    FOR EACH frequency IN freqs DO
        IF frequency < 0 THEN
            SET allNonNegative TO FALSE
            BREAK
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Output the result based on the frequency check
    IF allNonNegative THEN
        DISPLAY "YES"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "NO"
    END IF

END
```

### Assumptions:
- The strings provided by the user can contain spaces which need to be ignored in further calculations.
- The ASCII ranges for the characters being evaluated are from 'A' (65) to 'z' (122).
- An input string can contain any characters, but only valid characters within the mentioned ASCII range are considered for counting frequency.
- The pseudocode uses helper functions (like `REMOVE_SPACES` and `COUNT_CHARACTER`) for clarity and modularity.
