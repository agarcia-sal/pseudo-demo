**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Stage:**
   - Read two strings, string1 and string2, from user input.
   - Remove all spaces from both strings:
     - Create a list called cleanedString1 from string1 that includes all characters except spaces.
     - Create a list called cleanedString2 from string2 that includes all characters except spaces.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Initialize an empty list called frequencyDifferences.
   - For each character in the range from the ASCII value of 'A' to the ASCII value of 'z':
     - Count how many times the character appears in cleanedString1.
     - Count how many times the character appears in cleanedString2.
     - Calculate the difference in counts (count in string1 - count in string2) and add this difference to the frequencyDifferences list.

3. **Output Decision:**
   - Check how many elements in frequencyDifferences are less than zero.
   - If there are no negative elements (meaning all differences are zero or positive):
     - Print "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" 

**Summary:** 
The pseudocode takes two input strings, cleans them from spaces, computes the frequency differences of characters between the two strings, and then evaluates whether all character counts in the first string are greater than or equal to those in the second string, outputting "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
