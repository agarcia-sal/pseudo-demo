**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to determine if two input strings contain the same characters with the same frequency, ignoring spaces.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Obtain two strings from the user.
   - Remove any spaces from both strings.

2. **Prepare Character Frequency Count:**
   - Initialize a list to keep track of the frequency differences between the two strings.
   - For each character in the range from 'A' to 'z' (which includes all uppercase and lowercase letters):
     - Count how many times the character appears in the first string.
     - Count how many times the character appears in the second string.
     - Calculate the difference in frequency between the two strings for that character and store it in the list.

3. **Evaluate Character Frequencies:**
   - Check how many frequency differences in the list are negative (indicating that the second string has more of that character than the first).
   - If there are no negative differences, print "YES" (indicating both strings have the same character frequencies).
   - If there are negative differences, print "NO" (indicating a mismatch in character frequencies).

**Key Operations in Detail:**
- **Input Processing:** 
   - Define `firstString` = input from user without spaces.
   - Define `secondString` = input from user without spaces.
  
- **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Initialize `frequencyDifferencesList`.
   - For each character in the character set (from 'A' to 'z'):
     - `countInFirst` = number of occurrences of character in `firstString`.
     - `countInSecond` = number of occurrences of character in `secondString`.
     - Add the result of `countInFirst` minus `countInSecond` to `frequencyDifferencesList`.
  
- **Final Comparison:**
   - Count how many values in `frequencyDifferencesList` are less than 0.
   - If count is 0, output "YES" for equal frequencies.
   - Else, output "NO" for unequal frequencies.

**Conclusion:**  
This pseudocode effectively conveys the algorithmâ€™s logic for comparing the frequencies of characters in two strings, with clear input and output definitions, making it accessible and easy to understand.
