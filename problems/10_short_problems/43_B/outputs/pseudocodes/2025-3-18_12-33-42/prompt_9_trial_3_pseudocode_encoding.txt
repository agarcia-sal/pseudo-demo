**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to determine if two input strings (after removing spaces) can be considered equivalent in terms of character frequency. Specifically, it checks if the first string contains at least as many occurrences of each character as the second string does.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive User Input:**
   - Get the first string of characters from the user.
   - Get the second string of characters from the user.

2. **Process Input Strings:**
   - Remove all spaces from the first string.
   - Remove all spaces from the second string.

3. **Initialize Frequency Comparison:**
   - Create a list to store the frequency difference of each character from the first string compared to the second string.

4. **Calculate Character Frequencies:**
   - For each character from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count how many times this character appears in the first string.
     - Count how many times this character appears in the second string.
     - Calculate the difference in frequency (first string's count minus second string's count).
     - Store this difference in the frequency comparison list.

5. **Evaluate Frequency Differences:**
   - Count how many character frequency differences are less than zero (indicating that the first string lacks some characters compared to the second string).

6. **Generate Output:**
   - If the count of negative frequency differences is zero, print "YES" (indicating that the first string has sufficient characters).
   - Otherwise, print "NO" (indicating insufficiency of characters).

**Summary of Input and Output:**
- **Input:** Two lines of text input from the user (strings).
- **Output:** A single line indicating either "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison of character frequencies.
