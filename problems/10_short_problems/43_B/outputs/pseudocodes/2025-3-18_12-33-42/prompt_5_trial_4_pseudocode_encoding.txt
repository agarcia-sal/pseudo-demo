**Purpose:** The code checks if two input strings have the same frequency of characters (considering only non-space characters) and returns "YES" if they do, and "NO" if they do not.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CheckCharacterFrequencies
    // Step 1: Accept two lines of input from the user
    PROMPT "Enter the first string:"
    FIRST_STRING = GET user input
    PROMPT "Enter the second string:"
    SECOND_STRING = GET user input

    // Step 2: Prepare the strings by removing spaces
    S1 = REMOVE spaces from FIRST_STRING
    S2 = REMOVE spaces from SECOND_STRING

    // Step 3: Initialize a frequency list to count character differences
    FREQUENCIES = CREATE a list of size (maximum ASCII value of 'z' - minimum ASCII value of 'A' + 1) initialized to zero

    // Step 4: Calculate character frequency differences
    FOR each character from 'A' to 'z' DO
        CHARACTER_CODE = ASCII value of the character
        COUNT_IN_S1 = COUNT occurrences of character in S1
        COUNT_IN_S2 = COUNT occurrences of character in S2
        DIFFERENCE = COUNT_IN_S1 - COUNT_IN_S2
        STORE DIFFERENCE in FREQUENCIES at index corresponding to CHARACTER_CODE

    // Step 5: Check for any negative frequencies
    HAS_NEGATIVE = FALSE
    FOR each frequency in FREQUENCIES DO
        IF frequency is less than 0 THEN
            HAS_NEGATIVE = TRUE
            BREAK from the loop

    // Step 6: Produce the output based on the presence of negative frequencies
    IF HAS_NEGATIVE is FALSE THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
END FUNCTION
```

### Clarifications and Explanations:

1. **User Input:** The function gathers two strings from the user while prompting them clearly. Spaces are considered irrelevant for frequency checks.

2. **Frequency Calculation:** It uses a list to keep track of how many more times each character appears in the first string compared to the second.

3. **Negative Check:** The program simply checks if any character's frequency difference is negative, implying that the second string has more of that character than the first.

4. **Output Decision:** Based on whether any negative values are found in the frequency list, it outputs either "YES" or "NO".

This pseudocode aims to be straight forward, allowing readers unfamiliar with the original programming language to grasp its functionality easily.
