### Explanation of Complexity:
- The code processes two input strings and analyzes character frequency differences. 
- It iterates through a specific range of ASCII values, counting character occurrences, which simplifies the comparison.
- Checking for non-negative values in the frequency list is crucial to determine if the first string has equal or greater occurrences of every character compared to the second string.
