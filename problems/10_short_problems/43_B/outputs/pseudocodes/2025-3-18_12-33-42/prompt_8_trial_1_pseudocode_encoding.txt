**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to compare two input strings, determining if the first string contains all characters in sufficient quantity to match the characters in the second string, ignoring spaces. The program outputs "YES" if this is the case and "NO" otherwise.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input Strings:**
   - Receive the first string from user input.
   - Receive the second string from user input.

2. **Remove Spaces:**
   - For each input string:
     - Create a new list consisting of all characters from the string that are not spaces.
   - Assign the resulting lists to `stringOne` and `stringTwo`.

3. **Initialize Frequency List:**
   - Create a list called `characterFrequency` to store the difference in character counts. This list will have a length equal to the total number of characters from 'A' to 'z'.

4. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - For each character from 'A' to 'z':
     - Count how many times this character appears in `stringOne`.
     - Count how many times this character appears in `stringTwo`.
     - Calculate the difference: 
       - Store the result (count from `stringOne` minus count from `stringTwo`) in the `characterFrequency` list.

5. **Check for Sufficient Characters:**
   - Create a new list of negative values from `characterFrequency` by filtering the list where the value is less than zero.
   - If the length of this new list is zero:
     - This means there are no characters in `stringTwo` that are lacking in `stringOne`.
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

**Comments:**
- The program effectively checks if `stringOne` has all the necessary characters required to form `stringTwo`.
- It handles any whitespace by ignoring spaces when counting character occurrences.
- The character counting is done based on the ASCII values of characters from 'A' to 'z', which includes upper and lower case letters.
