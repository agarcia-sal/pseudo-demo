### Context and Complexity
This pseudocode clarifies the original code's logic by articulating the steps involved in reading two input strings, cleaning them (by removing spaces), calculating the frequency of each character, and determining if the first string can be considered to have at least as many occurrences of each character compared to the second string. The use of helper functions aids in maintaining clarity while promoting code reuse and abstraction.
