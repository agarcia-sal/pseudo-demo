Below is the pseudocode translation based on the provided code, following the instructed guidelines:

```plaintext
// Assume the input contains two lines of text where each line may contain spaces.
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Get input from the user
    DECLARE inputString1 AS STRING
    DECLARE inputString2 AS STRING
    
    PRINT "Enter first string:"
    READ inputString1  // User inputs the first line of text
    
    PRINT "Enter second string:"
    READ inputString2  // User inputs the second line of text

    // Step 2: Prepare lists of characters by removing spaces
    DECLARE s1 AS LIST OF CHARACTERS = []
    DECLARE s2 AS LIST OF CHARACTERS = []

    // Fill s1 with characters from inputString1 excluding spaces
    FOR EACH character IN inputString1 DO
        IF character IS NOT ' ' THEN
            APPEND character TO s1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Fill s2 with characters from inputString2 excluding spaces
    FOR EACH character IN inputString2 DO
        IF character IS NOT ' ' THEN
            APPEND character TO s2
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 3: Calculate frequency differences for characters A to z
    DECLARE freqs AS LIST OF INTEGERS = []
    
    FOR asciiValue FROM ORD('A') TO ORD('z') DO
        DECLARE countInS1 AS INTEGER = COUNT occurrences OF character WITH ASCII VALUE asciiValue IN s1
        DECLARE countInS2 AS INTEGER = COUNT occurrences OF character WITH ASCII VALUE asciiValue IN s2
        
        // Calculate the difference in counts
        DECLARE difference AS INTEGER = countInS1 - countInS2
        APPEND difference TO freqs 
    END FOR

    // Step 4: Check for any negative frequencies
    DECLARE hasNegativeFrequency AS BOOLEAN = FALSE

    FOR EACH frequency IN freqs DO
        IF frequency < 0 THEN
            hasNegativeFrequency = TRUE
            BREAK  // Exit loop if a negative frequency is found
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Print result based on frequencies
    IF hasNegativeFrequency IS FALSE THEN
        PRINT "YES"  // All characters in inputString1 are balanced against inputString2
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"   // Some characters in inputString1 exceed those in inputString2
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts by reading two strings from the user.
2. **Character Filtering:** It creates two lists, `s1` and `s2`, by filtering out spaces, ensuring only characters are counted.
3. **Frequency Calculation:** Frequencies of characters are calculated by taking the difference between counts in `s1` and `s2`.
4. **Negative Check:** It checks if there are any negative frequencies indicating that `s1` has fewer characters than `s2`.
5. **Output Result:** Finally, it prints "YES" or "NO" based on whether all frequencies are non-negative.

The pseudocode is structured for clarity, maintaining readability with meaningful identifiers and straightforward logical steps.
