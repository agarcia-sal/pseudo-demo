Here’s the pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided code in an easily understandable format:

```
BEGIN

    // Read two input strings from the user
    INPUT firstString
    INPUT secondString

    // Remove spaces from both strings and store the results
    REMOVE_SPACES_FROM firstString AS cleanedFirstString
    REMOVE_SPACES_FROM secondString AS cleanedSecondString

    // Initialize a frequency difference list for character counts
    INITIALIZE frequencyDifference AS an empty list

    // Calculate the frequency difference for each character from 'A' to 'z'
    FOR each ASCII value from the character 'A' (65) to the character 'z' (122) DO
        // Convert ASCII value to character
        SET currentCharacter AS character represented by ASCII value

        // Count occurrences of the character in both cleaned strings
        SET countInFirstString AS number of times currentCharacter appears in cleanedFirstString
        SET countInSecondString AS number of times currentCharacter appears in cleanedSecondString

        // Calculate the difference in counts and add to frequency difference list
        APPEND (countInFirstString - countInSecondString) TO frequencyDifference

    END FOR

    // Check if all differences are non-negative
    SET hasNegativeDifference AS TRUE

    FOR each difference in frequencyDifference DO
        IF difference < 0 THEN
            SET hasNegativeDifference AS FALSE
            BREAK OUT OF loop
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Output result based on the presence of negative differences
    IF hasNegativeDifference THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by obtaining two strings from the user.
- **Space Removal**: It includes a step to remove any spaces from the input strings.
- **Frequency Calculation**: It initiates a loop over ASCII values to count character occurrences in both cleaned strings and computes the difference in their counts.
- **Negative Difference Check**: Thereafter, it checks if any of the frequency differences are negative, marking that condition to determine the program’s output.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints "YES" if all frequency differences are non-negative, and "NO" if any are negative. 

This pseudocode effectively distills the logic of the algorithm into a clear, English-like format.
