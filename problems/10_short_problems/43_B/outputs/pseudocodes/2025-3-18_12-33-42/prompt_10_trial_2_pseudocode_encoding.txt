Certainly! Below is the pseudocode that outlines the logic of the provided code step by step, while keeping in mind clarity, structured language concepts, and the points you've highlighted.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program**

2. **Declare variables `s1` and `s2`**
   - Initialize `s1` as a list obtained from processing the first input string.
   - Initialize `s2` as a list obtained from processing the second input string.
   
3. **Define a function to process input strings**
   - For each input string:
       a. Read the input string.
       b. Remove all spaces from the string.
       c. Store the resulting string in the corresponding variable (`s1` or `s2`).

4. **Get user input**
   - Call the function twice to read two input strings:
       a. Store the first processed string in `s1`.
       b. Store the second processed string in `s2`.

5. **Declare a list `freqs` to hold frequency differences**
   - For each character in the ASCII range from 'A' (65) to 'z' (122):
       a. Count occurrences of the character in `s1`.
       b. Count occurrences of the character in `s2`.
       c. Calculate the difference of counts and store it in `freqs`.

6. **Check for negative frequencies**
   - Count how many elements in `freqs` are less than 0.
 
7. **Output result**
   - If the count of negative frequencies is zero:
       a. Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
       a. Print "NO".

8. **End the program**

**Assumptions:**
- The inputs consist of strings that may contain spaces and are comprised of valid characters within the ASCII range from 'A' to 'z'.
- There are no constraints on the length of the input strings, but they are assumed to fit within available memory.
- The program does not account for characters outside the specified ASCII range.

The pseudocode is designed to be clear and readable, outlining each intention and step taken while avoiding the specifics of programming syntax.
