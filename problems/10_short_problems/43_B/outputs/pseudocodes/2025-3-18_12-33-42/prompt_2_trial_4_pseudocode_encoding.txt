**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Get two strings from the user, referred to as 'first input string' and 'second input string'.
   
2. **Process Inputs:**
   - For each input string, create a new list that contains only the characters which are not spaces.
   - Store the processed versions of both input strings as 'processed first input' and 'processed second input'.

3. **Calculate Frequency Difference:**
   - Create a list to hold the frequency differences of characters.
   - For each character in the range from 'A' to 'z' (inclusive):
     - Count how many times the character appears in 'processed first input'.
     - Count how many times the character appears in 'processed second input'.
     - Calculate the difference between these two counts and store the result in the frequency differences list.

4. **Determine Output:**
   - Check if there are any negative values in the frequency differences list.
     - If there are no negative values, it means the first input string either has the same or more occurrences of each character compared to the second input string; therefore, output "YES".
     - If there are any negative values, output "NO".
