**Purpose**: The primary goal of this code is to compare two strings, determining if the first string can be transformed into the second string by adjusting the frequency of each character, disregarding spaces.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Input Two Strings**:
   - Get the first string from the user and assign it to the variable `firstInput`.
   - Get the second string from the user and assign it to the variable `secondInput`.

2. **Remove Spaces from Strings**:
   - Create a list called `cleanFirstInput` containing characters from `firstInput` excluding spaces.
   - Create a list called `cleanSecondInput` containing characters from `secondInput` excluding spaces.

3. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - Initialize an empty list called `frequencyDifferences`.
   - For each character in the range from the ASCII value of 'A' (65) to the ASCII value of 'z' (122):
     - Count how many times the current character appears in `cleanFirstInput` and in `cleanSecondInput`.
     - Calculate the difference between the count from `cleanFirstInput` and the count from `cleanSecondInput`.
     - Add this difference to the `frequencyDifferences` list.

4. **Check Character Count Validity**:
   - Create a list of all the differences from `frequencyDifferences` where the value is less than zero.
   - If the length of this list (negativeDifferences) is equal to zero:
     - Print "YES" (This means the first string can match the second).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (This means the first string cannot match the second).

**Comments for Clarity**:
- Spaces are ignored in the input strings to focus only on the relevant characters.
- The character count is compared to determine if the second string can be formed from the first string.
- Using ASCII values allows checking character counts for the entire range of English letters.

This pseudocode effectively captures the functionality and logic of the original code in an understandable format.
