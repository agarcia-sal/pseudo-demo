### Purpose
The goal of this algorithm is to determine if two input strings (after removing spaces) contain the same frequency of each character. If they do, the output will be "YES"; otherwise, the output will be "NO".

### Pseudocode

1. **Initialize Two Input Strings:**
   - Accept two strings from the user as input:
     - `firstString`
     - `secondString`

2. **Clean the Strings:**
   - Remove all spaces from `firstString`.
   - Remove all spaces from `secondString`.

3. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - Create a list to hold frequency differences for each character:
     - `frequencyDifferences`
   - For each character from 'A' (ASCII value 65) to 'z' (ASCII value 122):
     - Count the occurrences of this character in `firstString`.
     - Count the occurrences of this character in `secondString`.
     - Calculate the difference in counts:
       - `difference = countInFirstString - countInSecondString`
     - Store this difference in `frequencyDifferences`.

4. **Check Frequency Differences:**
   - Count how many frequency differences are negative in `frequencyDifferences`.

5. **Output Result:**
   - If the count of negative differences is zero:
     - Print "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO"

### Input and Output
- **Input:** Two strings provided by the user, potentially containing spaces.
- **Output:** A string "YES" or "NO" indicating whether the input strings have the same character frequencies after removing spaces.

### Breakdown of Complex Operations
- **Cleaning the Strings:** This involves filtering out spaces from the input strings.
- **Counting Character Frequencies:** This process involves iterating through the whole range of character ASCII values to check the counts for each character.

### Final Review
The pseudocode follows a clear step-by-step process to achieve the goal. It uses common language and definitions to ensure understanding and maintains the core logic of the original code.
