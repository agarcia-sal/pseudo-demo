Here is the high-level pseudocode that translates the provided Python code into a meaningful structure while maintaining clarity and abstraction:

```pseudocode
FUNCTION CheckIfStringsHaveEqualCharacterCounts()
    // INPUT: Read two lines of input strings
    FIRST_STRING = Read first input string
    SECOND_STRING = Read second input string
    
    // PROCESS: Remove spaces from both input strings
    Cleaned_FIRST_STRING = Remove spaces from FIRST_STRING
    Cleaned_SECOND_STRING = Remove spaces from SECOND_STRING
    
    // Create a list to hold the frequency differences of characters
    Initialize frequencyDifferences as an empty list
    
    // Determine the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'z'
    FOR ASCII_VALUE FROM ASCII value of 'A' TO ASCII value of 'z' DO
        COUNT_IN_FIRST = Count occurrences of character represented by ASCII_VALUE in Cleaned_FIRST_STRING
        COUNT_IN_SECOND = Count occurrences of character represented by ASCII_VALUE in Cleaned_SECOND_STRING
        
        // Calculate the difference in counts
        difference = COUNT_IN_FIRST - COUNT_IN_SECOND
        
        // Store the difference in the frequency list
        Add difference to frequencyDifferences
    END FOR
    
    // CHECK: Verify if all character frequency differences are non-negative
    IF there are no negative values in frequencyDifferences THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Purpose:** The pseudocode outlines a function that checks if the first string can be formed from the characters available in the second string after removing spaces.
2. **Structured Input Handling:** It reads two input strings and processes them to remove spaces, which improves clarity.
3. **Clear Logic for Character Counting:** It systematically counts character occurrences for both strings using their ASCII values to cover the expected range.
4. **Descriptive Naming:** Meaningful variable names like `Cleaned_FIRST_STRING` and `frequencyDifferences` clarify their roles.
5. **Control Structures:** The use of loops and conditions are expressed clearly to articulate the logic without delving into specific programming syntax. 

This structured pseudocode provides a clear and cohesive approach to understanding the original code's logic.
