### Explanation:
The pseudocode summarizes the logic of the original code. It captures the key functional steps such as reading input, cleaning up the strings by removing spaces, calculating frequency differences of character occurrences, and then checking if any of the differences are negative. The output clearly indicates whether the result is "YES" or "NO" based on the presence of negative frequencies. The intent is conveyed through meaningful variable names and structured flow.
