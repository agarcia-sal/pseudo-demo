**Objective**: The goal of this code is to compare two input strings and determine if one string can be formed from the characters of the other, without considering spaces.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Define Function: Check String Formation**  
   - This function evaluates if the characters of two strings can allow one to be formed from the other.

2. **Input Gathering**: 
   - Prompt the user to enter the first string.  
   - Prompt the user to enter the second string.  

3. **Process Input Strings**:  
   - Create the first list of characters by removing any spaces from the first input string.  
   - Create the second list of characters by removing any spaces from the second input string.  

4. **Initialize Frequency Count**:  
   - Create an empty list called frequencyDifferences to hold the differences in character counts.

5. **Count Character Frequencies**:  
   - For each character in the range from 'A' to 'z':
       - Count how many times this character appears in the first list.
       - Count how many times this character appears in the second list.
       - Calculate the difference: subtract the count in the second list from the count in the first list.
       - Add this difference to the frequencyDifferences list.

6. **Evaluate Frequencies**:  
   - Create a new list containing only the negative differences from the frequencyDifferences list.
   - Check if the length of this new list is zero.

7. **Output Result**:  
   - If the length of the list of negative differences is zero, print "YES" (indicating the first string can be formed from the second).
   - If the length is not zero, print "NO" (indicating it cannot be formed).

**Comments**:  
- Make sure to consider only the letter characters and ignore spaces in the input.  
- The frequency count compares how many more times characters appear in the first string as compared to the second, indicating the ability to form one string from the other.
