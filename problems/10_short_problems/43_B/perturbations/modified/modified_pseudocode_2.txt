**Objective:** The primary goal of the code is to check if two input strings can be considered equivalent in terms of character frequencies, excluding spaces.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input Strings:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first string and remove any spaces.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second string and remove any spaces.
   - Store the processed strings in two separate variables, named `firstString` and `secondString`.

2. **Initialize Character Frequency Difference:**
   - Create a list called `frequencyDifferences` that will hold the difference in character counts for each character based on the ASCII values from 'A' to 'z'.

3. **Calculate Frequency Differences:**
   - For each character in the ASCII range of capital 'A' (ASCII 65) to lowercase 'z' (ASCII 122):
     - Count how many times that character appears in `firstString` and in `secondString`.
     - Compute the difference in counts (firstString count - secondString count) and store this in `frequencyDifferences`.

4. **Determine If Strings Are Equivalent:**
   - Check how many values in `frequencyDifferences` are negative.
   - If there are no negative values, it means `firstString` has an equal or greater number of each character compared to `secondString`.

5. **Produce Output:**
   - If no negative values were found, print "YES" indicating the strings can be considered equivalent.
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

**Comments:**
- Removing spaces from the input strings ensures that the comparison only focuses on significant characters.
- The program uses ASCII values to handle a range of characters inclusively.
- The determination of equivalence is based on whether all character counts in the first string meet or exceed those in the second. 

**Example Structure:**
```plaintext
Start
    Get firstString from user input, remove spaces
    Get secondString from user input, remove spaces
    Initialize frequencyDifferences as an empty list
    For each character from 65 to 122 (ASCII representation):
        Count occurrences of the character in firstString
        Count occurrences of the character in secondString
        Calculate difference in counts and add to frequencyDifferences
    Count negative values in frequencyDifferences
    If there are no negative values:
        Print "YES"
    Else:
        Print "NO"
End
```
