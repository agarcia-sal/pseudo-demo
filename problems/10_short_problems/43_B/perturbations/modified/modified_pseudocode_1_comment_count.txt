**Pseudocode**:

1. **Get Input**:
   - Read first string from the user and store it as 'firstString'.
   - Read second string from the user and store it as 'secondString'.

2. 
   - Create 'cleanedFirstString' by removing all spaces from 'firstString'.
   - Create 'cleanedSecondString' by removing all spaces from 'secondString'.

3. 
   - Initialize an empty list 'differenceFrequencies' to store frequency differences of characters.
   - For each character represented by ASCII values from the character 'A' (65) to 'z' (122):
     - Count the occurrences of the character in 'cleanedFirstString' and subtract the count of the same character in 'cleanedSecondString'.
     - Append this result to 'differenceFrequencies'.

4. 
   - Check if there are any negative values in 'differenceFrequencies':
     - If there are no negative values , print "YES".
     - If there are any negative values , print "NO".
