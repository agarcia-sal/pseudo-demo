### Pseudocode:
```
START

FIRST_LINE = READ INPUT
SECOND_LINE = READ INPUT

CHARACTERS_FROM_FIRST_LINE = REMOVE SPACES FROM FIRST_LINE
CHARACTERS_FROM_SECOND_LINE = REMOVE SPACES FROM SECOND_LINE

FREQUENCY_DIFFERENCE = INITIALIZE AN EMPTY LIST

FOR each CHARACTER_CODE FROM ASCII VALUE OF 'A' TO ASCII VALUE OF 'z'
    COUNT_IN_FIRST_LINE = COUNT OF CHARACTER IN CHARACTERS_FROM_FIRST_LINE
    COUNT_IN_SECOND_LINE = COUNT OF CHARACTER IN CHARACTERS_FROM_SECOND_LINE
    DIFFERENCE = COUNT_IN_FIRST_LINE - COUNT_IN_SECOND_LINE
    ADD DIFFERENCE TO FREQUENCY_DIFFERENCE LIST
END FOR

NEGATIVE_COUNT = COUNT OF ELEMENTS IN FREQUENCY_DIFFERENCE THAT ARE LESS THAN 0

IF NEGATIVE_COUNT EQUALS 0 THEN
    PRINT "YES" 
ELSE
    PRINT "NO" 
END IF

END
```
