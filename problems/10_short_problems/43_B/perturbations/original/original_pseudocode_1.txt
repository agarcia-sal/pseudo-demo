**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to compare two strings by determining if all characters in the first string appear as many times or more than in the second string, ignoring spaces.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Get Input**:
   - Read first string from the user and store it as 'firstString'.
   - Read second string from the user and store it as 'secondString'.

2. **Remove Spaces**:
   - Create 'cleanedFirstString' by removing all spaces from 'firstString'.
   - Create 'cleanedSecondString' by removing all spaces from 'secondString'.

3. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - Initialize an empty list 'differenceFrequencies' to store frequency differences of characters.
   - For each character represented by ASCII values from the character 'A' (65) to 'z' (122):
     - Count the occurrences of the character in 'cleanedFirstString' and subtract the count of the same character in 'cleanedSecondString'.
     - Append this result to 'differenceFrequencies'.

4. **Evaluate Character Counts**:
   - Check if there are any negative values in 'differenceFrequencies':
     - If there are no negative values (this means all characters in the second string are covered by characters in the first string), print "YES".
     - If there are any negative values (this means some characters in the second string are not present enough in the first string), print "NO".

**Example**:
- Input: "hello world" and "world"
- After removing spaces, 'cleanedFirstString' = "helloworld" and 'cleanedSecondString' = "world".
- Count occurrences of each letter, and compare them to determine if 'cleanedFirstString' can cover 'cleanedSecondString'.
  
**Comments**:
- Character counting and comparison must be case-specific (as the code does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters). 

This pseudocode presents the high-level logic clearly, making it easy for someone with basic programming knowledge to understand the underlying functionality without getting bogged down by specific syntax.
