**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Receive Input from User**
   - Declare variable `firstInput`
   - Declare variable `secondInput`
   - Set `firstInput` to user input
   - Set `secondInput` to user input

3. **Initialize Lists**
   - Declare list `s1` and populate it with characters from `firstInput` that are not spaces
   - Declare list `s2` and populate it with characters from `secondInput` that are not spaces

4. **Initialize Frequency Counter**
   - Declare list `freqs` of size 256, initialized to zero (to count character occurrences)
  
5. **Calculate Character Frequencies**
   - For each ASCII value `x` from 65 (A) to 122 (z):
     - Count occurrences of character corresponding to `x` in `s1` and `s2`
     - Calculate the difference: 
       - `freqs[x] = Count in s1 - Count in s2`

6. **Determine if Frequencies are Non-Negative**
   - Count how many elements in `freqs` are less than 0
   - If count of negative elements is equal to 0:
       - Print "YES" 
   - Otherwise:
       - Print "NO"

7. **End Program**

**Assumptions:**
- Inputs from the user are strings.
- Only concerned with the ASCII range from 'A' to 'z', thus, characters not within this range aren't processed.
- The code assumes that characters are case-sensitive, i.e., 'a' and 'A' are treated as different characters.
