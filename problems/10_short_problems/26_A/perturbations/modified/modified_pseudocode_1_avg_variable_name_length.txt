**Purpose**: The goal of this program is to count how many numbers from 1 to a specified limit are prime, which means they have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Read Input**: 
   - Get an integer value from the user to represent the upper limit of the range.

2. **Initialize Counter**: 
   - Set a variable named `pri` to zero. This will keep track of how many prime numbers are found.

3. **Loop Through Each Number**:
   - For each number `cur` from 1 to the upper limit (inclusive):
       1. Set a variable `div_ct` to zero. This will count the number of divisors of the current number.
       2. Set a variable `tmp` equal to `cur`.

4. **Check for Divisors**:
   - For each possible divisor `pot` starting from 2 up to one less than `cur`:
       1. If `tmp` is divisible by `pot`:
           - Increment `div_ct` by 1.
           - While `tmp` is still divisible by `pot`, perform the following:
               - Divide `tmp` by `pot` (this helps factor out the divisor).
   
5. **Determine If Prime**:
   - After checking all potential divisors:
       - If `div_ct` equals 1, this means `cur` is prime:
           - Increment `pri` by 1.

6. **Output Result**:
   - After all numbers have been processed, print the value of `pri` which indicates the total number of prime numbers found.

**Comments**:
- The outer loop iterates through each number in the specified range.
- The inner loop checks each number for divisibility, helping to identify prime numbers by their unique count of divisors.

**Pseudocode** Illustration**:

```
READ upper_limit FROM user input
SET pri TO 0

FOR cur FROM 1 TO upper_limit DO:
    SET div_ct TO 0
    SET tmp TO cur

    FOR pot FROM 2 TO cur - 1 DO:
        IF tmp MOD pot EQUALS 0 THEN:
            INCREMENT div_ct BY 1
            WHILE tmp MOD pot EQUALS 0 DO:
                SET tmp TO tmp DIVIDED BY pot

    IF div_ct EQUALS 1 THEN:
        INCREMENT pri BY 1

PRINT pri
```
