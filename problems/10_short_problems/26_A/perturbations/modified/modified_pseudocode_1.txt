**Purpose**: The code aims to count how many numbers from 1 to a given input (t) are prime numbers.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start**: 
   - Read an integer value `t` from the user. This value represents the upper limit for our counting of prime numbers.
   
2. **Initialize Result**:
   - Set a variable called `primeCount` to 0. This will keep track of how many prime numbers are found.

3. **Loop Through Numbers**:
   - For each number `currentNumber` from 1 to `t` (inclusive):
     1. Set a variable `divisorCount` to 0.
     2. Set a variable `tempNumber` to `currentNumber`.

     3. **Check for Divisors**:
        - For each number `potentialDivisor` starting from 2 up to (but not including) `currentNumber`:
          - If `tempNumber` is divisible by `potentialDivisor` (which means `tempNumber` divided by `potentialDivisor` has no remainder):
            1. Increase `divisorCount` by 1, indicating we found a divisor.
            2. While `tempNumber` is still divisible by `potentialDivisor`:
               - Divide `tempNumber` by `potentialDivisor`. This simplifies `tempNumber` by removing that divisor completely.
     
     4. **Determine if Prime**:
        - After checking all potential divisors, if `divisorCount` equals 2, then count `currentNumber` as a prime number:
          - Increase `primeCount` by 1.

4. **Output Result**:
   - After completing the loop, print the value of `primeCount`, which represents how many prime numbers were found between 1 and `t`.

**Comments**: This pseudocode effectively captures the logic of the original code without specific programming syntax, making it easier to understand the process of identifying and counting prime numbers.
