**Purpose**: The goal of this program is to count how many numbers from 1 to a specified limit are prime, which means they have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Read Input**: 
   - Get an integer value from the user to represent the upper limit of the range.

2. **Initialize Counter**: 
   - Set a variable named `prime_count` to zero. This will keep track of how many prime numbers are found.

3. **Loop Through Each Number**:
   - For each number `current_number` from 1 to the upper limit (inclusive):
       1. Set a variable `divisor_count` to zero. This will count the number of divisors of the current number.
       2. Set a variable `temp_number` equal to `current_number`.

4. **Check for Divisors**:
   - For each possible divisor `potential_divisor` starting from 2 up to one less than `current_number`:
       1. If `temp_number` is divisible by `potential_divisor`:
           - Increment `divisor_count` by 1.
           - While `temp_number` is still divisible by `potential_divisor`, perform the following:
               - Divide `temp_number` by `potential_divisor` (this helps factor out the divisor).
   
5. **Determine If Prime**:
   - After checking all potential divisors:
       - If `divisor_count` equals 1, this means `current_number` is prime:
           - Increment `prime_count` by 1.

6. **Output Result**:
   - After all numbers have been processed, print the value of `prime_count` which indicates the total number of prime numbers found.

**Comments**:
- The outer loop iterates through each number in the specified range.
- The inner loop checks each number for divisibility, helping to identify prime numbers by their unique count of divisors.

**Pseudocode** Illustration**:

```
READ upper_limit FROM user input
SET prime_count TO 0

FOR current_number FROM 1 TO upper_limit DO:
    SET divisor_count TO 0
    SET temp_number TO current_number

    FOR potential_divisor FROM 2 TO current_number - 1 DO:
        IF temp_number MOD potential_divisor EQUALS 0 THEN:
            INCREMENT divisor_count BY 1
            WHILE temp_number MOD potential_divisor EQUALS 0 DO:
                SET temp_number TO temp_number DIVIDED BY potential_divisor

    IF divisor_count EQUALS 1 THEN:
        INCREMENT prime_count BY 1

PRINT prime_count
```
