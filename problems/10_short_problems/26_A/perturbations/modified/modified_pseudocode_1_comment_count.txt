**Pseudocode**:

```
READ upper_limit FROM user input
SET prime_count TO 0

FOR current_number FROM 1 TO upper_limit DO:
    SET divisor_count TO 0
    SET temp_number TO current_number

    FOR potential_divisor FROM 2 TO current_number - 1 DO:
        IF temp_number MOD potential_divisor EQUALS 0 THEN:
            INCREMENT divisor_count BY 1
            WHILE temp_number MOD potential_divisor EQUALS 0 DO:
                SET temp_number TO temp_number DIVIDED BY potential_divisor

    IF divisor_count EQUALS 1 THEN:
        INCREMENT prime_count BY 1

PRINT prime_count
```
