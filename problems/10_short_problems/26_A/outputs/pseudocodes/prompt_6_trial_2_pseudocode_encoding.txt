### Explanation:
- The pseudocode starts by gathering the input (upper limit) for the range of numbers to check for primes.
- It initializes a counter to track how many prime numbers are found.
- A nested loop iterates through possible numbers and checks each for prime characteristics using a divisor count.
- Whenever a number is confirmed to be prime (having exactly two distinct divisors), the counter is incremented.
- Finally, it outputs the total count of prime numbers discovered in the range from 1 up to the specified limit.
