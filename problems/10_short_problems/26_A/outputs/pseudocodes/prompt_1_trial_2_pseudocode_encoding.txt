**Pseudocode:**

1. Read an integer value `t` from the user input, which represents the upper limit for checking numbers.
2. Initialize a variable `result` to 0, which will count the numbers that satisfy specific criteria.
3. For each integer `currentNumber` from 1 to `t` (inclusive):
    1. Initialize a counter `divisorCount` to 0.
    2. Set a variable `value` equal to `currentNumber`.
    3. For each integer `potentialDivisor` from 2 to `currentNumber - 1`:
        1. If `value` is divisible by `potentialDivisor` (i.e., `value % potentialDivisor is 0`):
            1. Increment the `divisorCount` by 1.
            2. While `value` is still divisible by `potentialDivisor`:
                1. Divide `value` by `potentialDivisor`.
    4. If `divisorCount` equals 2:
        1. Increment `result` by 1, indicating that `currentNumber` satisfies the criteria.
4. After checking all numbers up to `t`, output the final count stored in `result`.
