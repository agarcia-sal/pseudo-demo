Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read the total number of integers to check for prime factors
    SET totalCount TO INPUT integer

    // Step 2: Initialize result variable to count specific integers
    SET specificPrimeCount TO 0

    // Step 3: Loop through each integer from 1 to totalCount
    FOR each integer currentInteger FROM 1 TO totalCount DO

        // Step 4: Initialize counter for prime factors
        SET primeFactorCount TO 0
        SET number TO currentInteger

        // Step 5: Check for prime factors starting from 2 up to currentInteger
        FOR each integer potentialFactor FROM 2 TO currentInteger - 1 DO

            // Step 6: Check if potentialFactor is a divisor of number
            IF number MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0 THEN

                // Increase the prime factor counter
                INCREMENT primeFactorCount

                // Step 7: Divide number by potentialFactor until it's no longer divisible
                WHILE number MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0 DO
                    SET number TO number / potentialFactor
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR
        
        // Step 8: Check if exactly two distinct prime factors were found
        IF primeFactorCount EQUALS 2 THEN
            // Increment the count of integers with exactly two prime factors
            INCREMENT specificPrimeCount
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 9: Output the final count of integers with exactly two distinct prime factors
    OUTPUT specificPrimeCount

END
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode starts by reading an integer that indicates how many integers will be checked.
- It initializes a counter for numbers that have exactly two prime factors.
- It loops through each integer from 1 to the total given.
- For each integer, it checks for potential factors starting from 2, counting how many distinct prime factors it finds.
- If it finds exactly two distinct prime factors, it increments the count.
- Finally, it outputs the total count of integers with exactly two prime factors.
