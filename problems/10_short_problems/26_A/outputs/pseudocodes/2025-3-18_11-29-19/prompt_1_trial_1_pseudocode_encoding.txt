**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start** the program.
2. **Read an integer** value `t` from user input.
3. **Initialize** a variable `result` to 0, which will count the desired numbers.
4. **Loop** through each integer `i` from 1 to `t` (inclusive):
    - **Initialize** a counter `count` to 0, which will keep track of distinct prime factors of `i`.
    - **Set** a temporary variable `number` equal to `i`.
    - **Loop** through each integer `j` from 2 to `i-1`:
        - **Check** if `number` is divisible by `j`:
            - If it is:
                - **Increment** the `count` of prime factors by 1.
                - **While** `number` is still divisible by `j`:
                    - **Divide** `number` by `j` (removing all occurrences of this prime factor).
    - **Check** if `count` is equal to 2:
        - If true, **increment** `result` by 1 (this indicates that `i` has exactly two distinct prime factors).
5. **Output** the value of `result`.

**End of Pseudocode.**
