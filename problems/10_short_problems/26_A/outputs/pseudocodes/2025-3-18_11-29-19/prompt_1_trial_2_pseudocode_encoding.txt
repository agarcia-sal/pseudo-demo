**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**  
2. **Read input:** Get the integer value `t` that represents the upper limit.

3. Initialize a variable `result` to 0, which will store the count of specific numbers.

4. **For each number i from 1 to t:**
   - Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of distinct prime factors of `i`.
   - Set `currentNumber` to `i`.

   5. **For each potential factor j from 2 to (i - 1):**
      - **If currentNumber is divisible by j:**  
        - Increment `count` by 1.  
        - **While currentNumber is divisible by j:**  
            - Divide `currentNumber` by j (to remove this factor completely).

   6. **If count is exactly 2:**  
      - Increment `result` by 1 (indicating that `i` has exactly two distinct prime factors).

7. **Output the value of result:**  
   - This value represents the count of numbers from 1 to t that have exactly two distinct prime factors.

8. **End**
