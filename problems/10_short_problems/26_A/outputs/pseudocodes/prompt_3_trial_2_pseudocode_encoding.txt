Here is a structured pseudocode representation of the provided code, focusing on its intent and flow:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read the total number of test cases
    DECLARE totalTestCases AS INTEGER
    totalTestCases = READ INTEGER INPUT

    // Step 2: Initialize the result counter
    DECLARE primeCount AS INTEGER
    primeCount = 0

    // Step 3: Iterate over each number from 1 to totalTestCases
    FOR number FROM 1 TO totalTestCases DO
        DECLARE factorCount AS INTEGER
        factorCount = 0
        DECLARE currentNumber AS INTEGER
        currentNumber = number

        // Step 4: Check for factors starting from 2 to currentNumber-1
        FOR potentialFactor FROM 2 TO currentNumber - 1 DO
            // Step 5: Check if potentialFactor is a factor of currentNumber
            IF currentNumber MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0 THEN
                // Step 6: Increment factorCount for each valid factor found
                factorCount = factorCount + 1

                // Step 7: Divide currentNumber by potentialFactor until it is no longer divisible
                WHILE currentNumber MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0 DO
                    currentNumber = currentNumber / potentialFactor
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR

        // Step 8: Check if the number has exactly 2 distinct prime factors
        IF factorCount EQUALS 2 THEN
            primeCount = primeCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 9: Output the total count of numbers with exactly 2 distinct prime factors
    PRINT primeCount

END
```

### Explanation:
- **Input/Output**: The pseudocode captures the input of the number of test cases and tracks the count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors.
- **Structure**: It clearly outlines the overall flow, from reading input through loops and conditionals, to printing the resulting count.
- **Control Structures**: It uses clear language to represent loops (`FOR`, `WHILE`) and conditionals (`IF`), improving understanding for someone not familiar with the original coding language.
