Hereâ€™s the high-level pseudocode that reflects the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION countDistinctPrimeNumbers(maxNumber)
    INITIALIZE resultCount TO 0  // This will store the total count of distinct prime numbers

    // Iterate over each number from 1 to maxNumber
    FOR currentNumber FROM 1 TO maxNumber DO
        INITIALIZE distinctPrimeCount TO 0  // Counter for distinct prime factors
        SET divisibleNumber TO currentNumber  // Store the current number for factorization

        // Check for prime factors starting from 2
        FOR potentialPrime FROM 2 TO currentNumber - 1 DO
            // If potentialPrime divides divisibleNumber
            IF (divisibleNumber MOD potentialPrime == 0) THEN
                INCREMENT distinctPrimeCount BY 1  // Found a new distinct prime factor

                // Divide out all occurrences of potentialPrime from divisibleNumber
                WHILE (divisibleNumber MOD potentialPrime == 0) DO
                    DIVIDE divisibleNumber BY potentialPrime  // Reduce the number
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR

        // If exactly two distinct prime factors were found, count this number
        IF (distinctPrimeCount == 2) THEN
            INCREMENT resultCount BY 1  // Increment result count for a valid number
        END IF
    END FOR

    RETURN resultCount  // Return the total count of numbers with two distinct prime factors
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
READ input maxNumber  // Read the input value for maximum number
CALL countDistinctPrimeNumbers(maxNumber)  // Execute the function with the input value
```

### Explanation of the Structure:

1. **Function Declaration:** The function `countDistinctPrimeNumbers` takes an integer `maxNumber` as input, which represents the upper limit for counting numbers with distinct prime factors.

2. **Initialization:** The result variable (`resultCount`) is initialized to zero to keep track of how many numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors are found.

3. **Outer Loop:** The outer loop iterates through each number from 1 to `maxNumber`.

4. **Inner Loop:** For each number, an inner loop checks potential prime factors starting from 2 up to the current number minus one.

5. **Prime Factor Check:** If a potential prime factor divides the current number, it increments the count of distinct prime factors and reduces the current number by dividing out the prime factor until it no longer divides evenly.

6. **Count Condition:** After checking all potential prime factors for the current number, it checks if exactly two distinct primes were found and increments the result accordingly.

7. **Return Result:** After all iterations, the function returns the count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors.

This pseudocode maintains abstraction, uses clear variable names, outlines the inputs and outputs, and explains the relevant control structures, adhering to the high-level format specified in the instructions.
