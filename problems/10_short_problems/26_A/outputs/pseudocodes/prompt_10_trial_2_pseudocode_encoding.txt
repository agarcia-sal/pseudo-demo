Here is a clear and concise pseudocode based on the provided code, following the steps outlined:

```
1. Set variable t to the integer value input by the user.
2. Initialize variable res to 0 to store the count of specific numbers.
3. For each integer i starting from 1 to t (inclusive):
   a. Initialize variable cnt to 0 to count factors of i.
   b. Set variable num to i (to check its factors).
   c. For each integer j starting from 2 to (i - 1):
      i. If num is divisible by j (num mod j equals 0):
         - Increment cnt by 1 to count the factor.
         - While num is divisible by j:
            * Divide num by j (reduce num by factor j).
   d. If cnt equals 2 (indicating exactly two distinct prime factors):
      - Increment res by 1 to count this special case.
4. Output the value of res (the total count of numbers satisfying the condition).
```

### Assumptions:
- Variable `t` is assumed to be a positive integer.
- Variables `res`, `cnt`, `i`, `j`, and `num` can handle integer arithmetic.
- The input must be within a reasonable range to avoid performance issues.
