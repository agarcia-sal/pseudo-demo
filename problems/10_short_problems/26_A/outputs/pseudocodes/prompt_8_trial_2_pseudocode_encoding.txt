**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to count and output the number of "prime numbers" from 1 to a specified integer input by the user.

**Pseudocode**:

```
BEGIN

    // Take an integer input from the user representing the upper limit
    PROMPT user for an integer "t"
    
    // Initialize a variable to count the number of prime numbers
    SET primeCount = 0
    
    // Loop through each number from 1 to t (inclusive)
    FOR each number "i" from 1 to t DO
        
        // Initialize a counter to track the number of distinct prime factors
        SET distinctPrimeFactorsCount = 0
        SET currentNumber = i
        
        // Check for potential prime factors starting from 2 to (i-1)
        FOR each potentialFactor "j" from 2 to (i-1) DO
            
            // If "j" is a factor of the current number
            IF currentNumber MOD j EQUALS 0 THEN
                
                // Increment the count of distinct prime factors
                INCREMENT distinctPrimeFactorsCount by 1
                
                // Divide the current number by the factor "j" until it is no longer divisible
                WHILE currentNumber MOD j EQUALS 0 DO
                    SET currentNumber = currentNumber DIVIDED BY j
            
            END IF
        
        // Check if there are exactly 2 distinct prime factors (i.e., indicating it is a prime)
        IF distinctPrimeFactorsCount EQUALS 2 THEN
            // Increment the total prime count
            INCREMENT primeCount by 1
        END IF
    
    END FOR
    
    // Output the total count of prime numbers found
    PRINT primeCount

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The program begins by asking the user for an integer input (denoted as "t"), which defines the range to check for prime numbers.

2. **Counting Primes**: The main counting mechanism is initiated by setting a variable `primeCount` to zero. This will keep track of how many prime numbers are found.

3. **Outer Loop**: A loop iterates from 1 to the integer "t". For each number "i" in this range:
   - A nested counter `distinctPrimeFactorsCount` is initialized to zero for counting unique prime factors of the current number.

4. **Inner Loop**: Another loop runs from 2 to (i-1). For each potential prime factor "j":
   - If "j" divides the current number without a remainder, it indicates "j" is a prime factor.
   - The counter for distinct prime factors is incremented, and the current number is continuously divided by "j" until it no longer divides evenly.

5. **Counting Primes Logic**: After examining all possible factors:
   - If the count of distinct prime factors equals 2, it implies that the number is prime.
   - Consequently, the total prime count is incremented.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program outputs the total number of prime numbers found in the specified range. 

This structured approach ensures clarity in logic while remaining accessible to those who may not be familiar with programming syntax.
