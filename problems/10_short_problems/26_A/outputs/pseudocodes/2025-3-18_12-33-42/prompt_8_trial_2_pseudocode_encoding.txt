**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to count the number of prime numbers up to a given number, `t`.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start**: Set the input variable `t` to an integer value based on user input.

2. **Initialize Result Counter**: Create a variable, `primeCount`, and set it to 0. This will keep track of how many prime numbers are found.

3. **Loop Through Each Number**: For each integer `currentNumber` from 1 to `t`, do the following:
    - **Initialize Divisor Count**: Create a variable, `divisorCount`, and set it to 0. This will count how many divisors the `currentNumber` has.
    - **Set a Temporary Number**: Assign `currentNumber` to a temporary variable, `tempNumber`.

4. **Check for Divisors**: For each integer `divisor` starting from 2 up to one less than `currentNumber`:
    - **Check Divisibility**: If `tempNumber` can be evenly divided by `divisor` (i.e., the remainder is zero):
        - Increase `divisorCount` by 1.
        - **Factor Out Divisor**: While `tempNumber` is still divisible by `divisor` (i.e., the remainder is zero):
            - Divide `tempNumber` by `divisor`.

5. **Determine if Prime**: After checking all possible divisors, if `divisorCount` equals 2:
    - Increase `primeCount` by 1, since this means `currentNumber` is a prime number.

6. **Output Result**: After finishing the loop through all numbers, display the value of `primeCount`, which represents the total count of prime numbers up to `t`.

**Comments**:
- The loop from 1 to `t` checks each number to see if it has exactly two divisors (which is a characteristic of prime numbers).
- The inner loop iterates over potential divisors starting from 2, which is the smallest prime number.
- The use of temporary variable `tempNumber` allows continuous division by prime factors until the number is fully factored.
- Finally, the program counts how many numbers meet the criteria of being prime and outputs that number.

**Summary of Structure**:
```
1. Get input t from the user
2. Initialize primeCount = 0
3. For currentNumber from 1 to t:
    a. Initialize divisorCount = 0
    b. Set tempNumber = currentNumber
    c. For divisor from 2 to (currentNumber - 1):
        i. If tempNumber is divisible by divisor:
            - Increment divisorCount
            - While tempNumber is divisible by divisor:
                - Divide tempNumber by divisor
    d. If divisorCount equals 2:
        - Increment primeCount
4. Print primeCount
``` 

This pseudocode outlines the logic clearly, making it accessible to readers without programming knowledge while preserving the core functionality of the original code.
