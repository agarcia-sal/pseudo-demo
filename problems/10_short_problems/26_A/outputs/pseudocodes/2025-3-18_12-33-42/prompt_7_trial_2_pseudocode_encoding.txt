Here is the high-level pseudocode based on the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION countPrimeNumbers(limit)
    INITIALIZE result as 0
    FOR each integer i from 1 to limit DO
        INITIALIZE divisorCount as 0
        SET currentNumber to i
        FOR each integer j from 2 to (i - 1) DO
            IF currentNumber is divisible by j THEN
                INCREMENT divisorCount by 1
                WHILE currentNumber is divisible by j DO
                    DIVIDE currentNumber by j
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR
        IF divisorCount is equal to 2 THEN
            INCREMENT result by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    RETURN result
END FUNCTION

// INPUT: An integer 't' representing the upper limit
// OUTPUT: The count of prime numbers between 1 and 't'
```

### Explanation of Key Parts:
1. **Function Purpose:** The function counts how many prime numbers exist within the range of 1 to a specified upper limit (`t`).
2. **Main Loop:** For each integer `i` within the range, it checks potential divisors to determine if `i` is a prime number. 
3. **Divisor Counting:** The `divisorCount` variable counts how many unique prime divisors a number has. A prime number will have exactly two unique divisors: 1 and itself.
4. **Output:** The function finally returns the total count of prime numbers found up to the specified limit. 

This pseudocode provides a clear structure and logic flow while avoiding implementation specific details, making it accessible to readers with various programming backgrounds.
