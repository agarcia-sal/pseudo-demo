Here is a clear and concise pseudocode representation of the provided code, following the guided steps:

### Pseudocode

1. **Initialize variables:**
   - Set `t` as an integer input from the user.
   - Set `res` to 0 (this will hold the count of prime numbers).

2. **Loop through each integer from 1 to t (inclusive):**
   - For each integer `i` in the range from 1 to t:
     - Set `cnt` to 0 (this counts the number of divisors).
     - Set `num` to `i` (this will be used to check for prime factors).
     
     3. **Check for factors of `num`:**
        - For each integer `j` in the range from 2 to `i` (exclusive):
          - If `num` is divisible by `j`:
            - Increment `cnt` by 1 (count a new factor).
            - **While loop for repeated factors:**
              - While `num` is divisible by `j`:
                - Divide `num` by `j` (remove the factor).
                
     4. **Check if the number is prime:**
        - If `cnt` equals 2:
          - Increment `res` by 1 (this indicates that `i` is a prime number).

5. **Output the result:**
   - Print the value of `res` (the total count of prime numbers found).

### Assumptions:
- The input `t` is a positive integer.
- The program is expected to find prime numbers within the range from 1 to `t`.

This pseudocode maintains clarity by using meaningful identifiers and present tense action verbs, ensuring that the logic of the original code is easily understood without the complexities of programming syntax.
