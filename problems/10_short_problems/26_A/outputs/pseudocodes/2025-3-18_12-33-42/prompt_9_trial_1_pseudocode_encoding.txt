**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to count how many numbers within a specified range are classified as prime numbers.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Set the total count of numbers to check, `totalCount`, by reading an integer value input from the user.

2. **Initialize Result Counter:**
   - Set a variable `primeCount` to zero to keep track of how many prime numbers are found.

3. **Loop Through Each Number:**
   - For each integer `currentNumber` starting from 1 up to `totalCount` (inclusive), do the following:
     - Initialize a variable `divisorCount` to zero to count how many divisors `currentNumber` has.
     - Set a variable `remainingNumber` to the value of `currentNumber` for factorization.

4. **Check for Divisors:**
   - For each integer `potentialDivisor` starting from 2 up to one less than `currentNumber`, perform the following:
     - If `remainingNumber` is divisible by `potentialDivisor`, then:
       - Increase `divisorCount` by one (indicating a found divisor).
       - While `remainingNumber` is still divisible by `potentialDivisor`, do the following:
         - Divide `remainingNumber` by `potentialDivisor` to remove that factor.

5. **Identify Prime Numbers:**
   - After checking all potential divisors, if `divisorCount` equals 2 (which indicates that the number is prime):
     - Increase `primeCount` by one.

6. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the value of `primeCount`, which represents the total number of prime numbers found up to `totalCount`.

**Summary:**  
This pseudocode outlines the logic for counting prime numbers within a given range by checking each number for its divisibility by integers and tracking the number of distinct prime factors. The final result reflects the total count of prime numbers.
