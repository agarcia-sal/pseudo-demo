Hereâ€™s the pseudocode based on the provided code, following the steps outlined:

```
1. Initialize variable t as an integer input from the user.

2. Initialize variable res to 0 to hold the count of special numbers.

3. For each integer i from 1 to t (inclusive):
    a. Initialize variable cnt to 0 to count the number of distinct prime factors of i.
    b. Set variable num to i for factorization purposes.
    
    4. For each integer j from 2 to i-1:
        a. Check if num is divisible by j:
            i. If yes, increment cnt by 1 (a new distinct factor found).
            ii. While num is divisible by j:
                A. Divide num by j to factor out j completely.

    5. After processing all j values, check if cnt equals 2:
        a. If yes, increment res by 1 (i has exactly two distinct prime factors).

6. After the loop ends, print the value of res (the count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors).
```

### Assumptions:
- The input received by the variable `t` is a positive integer.
- The output of `res` represents the count of integers from 1 to `t` that have exactly two distinct prime factors.
- The value of `i` starts from 1, and the calculations consider all numbers up to `t`.
