**Pseudocode for Counting Prime Numbers**

```
BEGIN

    // Input: Read an integer t from the user
    SET numCount = t

    // Initialize variable to store the count of prime numbers
    SET primeCount = 0

    // Loop through each integer from 1 to t (inclusive)
    FOR each integer currentNumber FROM 1 TO numCount DO
        // Initialize a variable to count the number of distinct prime factors
        SET distinctPrimeFactors = 0
        
        // Temporary variable to work with currentNumber
        SET tempNumber = currentNumber
        
        // Check for factors starting from 2 to one less than currentNumber
        FOR each integer potentialFactor FROM 2 TO currentNumber - 1 DO
            // If potentialFactor is a divisor of tempNumber
            IF (tempNumber MOD potentialFactor == 0) THEN
                // Increment the count of distinct prime factors
                INCREMENT distinctPrimeFactors
                
                // Divide tempNumber by potentialFactor until it is no longer divisible
                WHILE (tempNumber MOD potentialFactor == 0) DO
                    SET tempNumber = tempNumber / potentialFactor
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR
        
        // A prime number must have exactly two distinct prime factors (1 and itself)
        IF (distinctPrimeFactors == 2) THEN
            // Increment the prime count
            INCREMENT primeCount
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Output: Print the total count of prime numbers found
    PRINT primeCount

END
```

### Explanation
- The pseudocode begins with reading an integer input, which is the upper limit for checking prime numbers.
- It sets up a loop to process each number from 1 to the input number and counts how many distinct prime factors each number has.
- In the inner loop, it checks for divisibility and counts distinct prime factors.
- Finally, it checks if the count of distinct prime factors is exactly two, signifying a prime number, and increments the prime count accordingly before outputting the total count of prime numbers found.
