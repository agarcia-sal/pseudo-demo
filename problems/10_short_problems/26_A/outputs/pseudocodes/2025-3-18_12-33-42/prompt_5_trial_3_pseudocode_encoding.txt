### Summary of Purpose:
The purpose of this code is to count how many numbers within a specified range are semiprime numbers, which are defined as numbers that have exactly two prime factors.

### Pseudocode:

```
BEGIN

    // Capture the total count of numbers to be checked
    SET totalNumbers TO INTEGER INPUT

    // Initialize a counter for semiprime numbers
    SET semiprimeCount TO 0

    // Loop through each number from 1 to totalNumbers
    FOR currentNumber FROM 1 TO totalNumbers DO

        // Initialize a counter for the number of distinct prime factors
        SET distinctPrimeFactors TO 0
        
        // Start with the current number to check for prime factors
        SET remainingValue TO currentNumber
        
        // Loop through potential factors starting from 2 up to currentNumber-1
        FOR potentialFactor FROM 2 TO currentNumber-1 DO
        
            // Check if the potential factor is a divisor of remainingValue
            IF remainingValue MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0 THEN
            
                // Increment the count of distinct prime factors
                INCREMENT distinctPrimeFactors BY 1
                
                // Divide remainingValue by potentialFactor until it is no longer divisible
                WHILE remainingValue MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0 DO
                    SET remainingValue TO remainingValue DIVIDED BY potentialFactor
                END WHILE
                
            END IF
            
        END FOR

        // After checking all factors, check if we found exactly two prime factors
        IF distinctPrimeFactors EQUALS 2 THEN
            // Increment the count of semiprime numbers
            INCREMENT semiprimeCount BY 1
        END IF
        
    END FOR

    // Output the total count of semiprime numbers found
    PRINT semiprimeCount

END
```

### Explanation and Logic:
1. **Input Collection:** The program starts by taking a single integer input that determines how many numbers will be analyzed.
2. **Counting Semiprimes:** A loop iterates over each number from 1 through the specified input number.
3. **Finding Factors:** For each number, another loop checks potential factors starting from 2, counting how many distinct prime factors it has.
4. **Semiprime Check:** If a number has exactly two distinct prime factors, it is considered semiprime, and the semiprime counter is increased.
5. **Final Output:** The program concludes by printing the total count of semiprime numbers identified in the specified range. 

### Note:
The pseudocode is structured to provide clarity on the logical flow and serves to illustrate how the original code functions, without the specific syntax of any programming language.
