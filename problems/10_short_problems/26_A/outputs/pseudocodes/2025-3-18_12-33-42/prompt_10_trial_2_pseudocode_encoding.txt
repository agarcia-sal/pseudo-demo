Hereâ€™s the pseudocode based on your instructions to translate the provided code into clear and concise structured language:

```
BEGIN

    // Assume 't' is a positive integer input from the user
    SET t AS INTEGER
    INPUT t

    // Initialize the result counter to zero
    SET res TO 0

    // Loop through each integer from 1 to t, inclusive
    FOR i FROM 1 TO t DO

        // Initialize a counter for the number of distinct prime factors
        SET cnt TO 0
        SET num TO i  // Set num to the current integer i

        // Check for prime factors starting from 2 up to i - 1
        FOR j FROM 2 TO (i - 1) DO

            // If j is a divisor of num
            IF (num MOD j EQUALS 0) THEN
                // Increment the count of distinct prime factors
                INCREMENT cnt BY 1

                // Divide num by j until j is no longer a divisor
                WHILE (num MOD j EQUALS 0) DO
                    SET num TO num DIVIDED BY j
                END WHILE

            END IF

        END FOR

        // Check if the current number has exactly 2 distinct prime factors
        IF (cnt EQUALS 2) THEN
            // Increment the result counter
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF

    END FOR

    // Output the final count of numbers with exactly 2 distinct prime factors
    OUTPUT res

END
```

### Explanation
1. **Main Components:** The pseudocode includes main structures like loops (`FOR`, `WHILE`) and conditionals (`IF`). It also keeps track of variables for the input (`t`), counter (`res`), and factors (`cnt`, `num`).
  
2. **Break Down Complex Elements:** The logic for checking if a number has prime factors is separated clearly into steps: checking divisibility, counting distinct prime factors, and reducing the number.

3. **State Assumptions Clearly:** The pseudocode assumes the input will be a valid positive integer, and types are stated where relevant.

4. **Clarity and Readability:** Variable names are meaningful (e.g., `res`, `cnt`, `num`) and actions are expressed clearly for better understanding.

5. **Present Tense Usage:** The actions are framed in the present tense, indicating ongoing processes like setting, incrementing, and outputting values.
