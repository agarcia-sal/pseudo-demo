**Purpose**: The goal of the code is to count how many numbers between 1 and a specified integer (inclusive) are semiprime numbers, which are defined as numbers that have exactly two distinct prime factors.

---

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Input**: 
   - Read an integer value `t` from the user, which represents the upper limit for checking semiprime numbers.

2. **Initialize Result**:
   - Set a variable `semiprimeCount` to 0 to keep track of the number of semiprime numbers found.

3. **Loop Through Each Number**:
   - For each integer `currentNumber` from 1 to `t` (inclusive):
     - Initialize a variable `distinctPrimeCount` to 0 to count the distinct prime factors of `currentNumber`.
     - Set a variable `tempNumber` to `currentNumber` to perform factorization.

4. **Check for Prime Factors**:
   - For each integer `potentialFactor` starting from 2 up to `currentNumber - 1`:
     - If `tempNumber` is divisible by `potentialFactor` (i.e., `tempNumber` mod `potentialFactor` equals 0):
       - Increment `distinctPrimeCount` by 1.
       - While `tempNumber` is divisible by `potentialFactor`:
         - Divide `tempNumber` by `potentialFactor` (removing all occurrences of this factor).

5. **Determine Semiprime Status**:
   - After checking potential factors for `currentNumber`, if `distinctPrimeCount` equals 2 (indicating it has exactly two distinct prime factors):
     - Increment `semiprimeCount` by 1.

6. **Output Result**:
   - Print the value of `semiprimeCount`, the total number of semiprime numbers found between 1 and `t`.

**Comments**:
- This pseudocode outlines how to identify semiprime numbers by factorizing each integer and counting distinct primes.
- The algorithm operates in a basic nested loop structure, leading to potentially higher computational times for larger values of `t`.
- The goal of understanding how many numbers fit the semiprime criteria guides the structure of the code. 

**Example Structure**:
```plaintext
BEGIN
    INPUT t
    SET semiprimeCount TO 0
    FOR currentNumber FROM 1 TO t INCLUSIVE DO
        SET distinctPrimeCount TO 0
        SET tempNumber TO currentNumber
        FOR potentialFactor FROM 2 TO currentNumber - 1 DO
            IF tempNumber MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0 THEN
                INCREMENT distinctPrimeCount
                WHILE tempNumber MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0 DO
                    SET tempNumber TO tempNumber / potentialFactor
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR
        IF distinctPrimeCount EQUALS 2 THEN
            INCREMENT semiprimeCount
        END IF
    END FOR
    OUTPUT semiprimeCount
END
``` 

This approach ensures clarity and accessibility for readers new to the concept, while effectively conveying the logic behind the original code.
