### Purpose Summary
The purpose of the code is to count how many numbers from 1 to a given number \( t \) are semiprime, meaning they have exactly two distinct prime factors.

### Pseudocode

1. **Define the main function**
    - Start a function to calculate semiprime numbers.

2. **Receive Input**
    - Get an integer input from the user, naming it `maximumNumber`.

3. **Initialize Result Counter**
    - Set a variable `semiprimeCount` to 0 to keep track of the number of semiprime numbers.

4. **Iterate Through Numbers**
    - For each integer `currentNumber` from 1 to `maximumNumber` (inclusive):
        - Initialize a variable `distinctPrimeCount` to 0 to count distinct prime factors of `currentNumber`.
        - Set a variable `tempNumber` to `currentNumber` for factorization processing.
        
        5. **Check for Prime Factors**
            - For each integer `potentialFactor` from 2 to `currentNumber - 1`:
                - If `tempNumber` is divisible by `potentialFactor`:
                    - Increment `distinctPrimeCount` by 1.
                    - While `tempNumber` is divisible by `potentialFactor`:
                        - Divide `tempNumber` by `potentialFactor` (to remove all occurrences of this factor).
        
        6. **Check Semiprimality**
            - If `distinctPrimeCount` is exactly 2:
                - Increment `semiprimeCount` by 1.

7. **Output Result**
    - Print the value of `semiprimeCount`, which represents the total count of semiprime numbers up to `maximumNumber`.

### Comments for Clarity
- The outer loop iterates through each integer from 1 to the input number, checking for the conditions of semiprimality.
- The inner loop checks for potential prime factors and counts them. If the same factor appears multiple times, it ensures that it is only counted once.
- The semiprime condition requires exactly two distinct prime factors, so only those values result in an increment of the count.

### Final Pseudocode Structure
```plaintext
function countSemiprimeNumbers():
    maximumNumber = get user input as integer
    semiprimeCount = 0

    for currentNumber from 1 to maximumNumber inclusive:
        distinctPrimeCount = 0
        tempNumber = currentNumber
        
        for potentialFactor from 2 to currentNumber - 1:
            if tempNumber is divisible by potentialFactor:
                distinctPrimeCount += 1
                while tempNumber is divisible by potentialFactor:
                    tempNumber = tempNumber / potentialFactor  # Reduce tempNumber
                
        if distinctPrimeCount is 2:
            semiprimeCount += 1

    print semiprimeCount  # Output the total count of semiprime numbers
```

### Review and Revision
This pseudocode clearly conveys the process and logic of the original code, breaking down the structure into comprehensible steps while ensuring it remains accessible to an audience without programming background.
