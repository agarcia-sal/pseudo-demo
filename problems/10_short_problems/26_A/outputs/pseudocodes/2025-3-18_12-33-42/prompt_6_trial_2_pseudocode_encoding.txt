Here's the translated pseudocode that captures the algorithm's logic in a clear and understandable manner:

```plaintext
// Input: A positive integer t
SET totalNumbers AS t

// Initialize a variable to count special numbers
SET specialNumberCount AS 0

// Loop through each integer from 1 to t
FOR currentNumber FROM 1 TO totalNumbers DO
    // Initialize a counter for prime factors
    SET primeFactorCount AS 0
    // Store the current number to check its factors
    SET numberToCheck AS currentNumber

    // Loop through possible divisors from 2 to currentNumber - 1
    FOR divisor FROM 2 TO currentNumber - 1 DO
        // Check if divisor is a factor of numberToCheck
        IF (numberToCheck MOD divisor EQUALS 0) THEN
            // Found a prime factor; increment the counter
            INCREMENT primeFactorCount
            // Remove all occurrences of the divisor from numberToCheck
            WHILE (numberToCheck MOD divisor EQUALS 0) DO
                SET numberToCheck AS numberToCheck DIVIDED BY divisor

    // Check if the number has exactly two distinct prime factors
    IF (primeFactorCount EQUALS 2) THEN
        // Count this number as a special number
        INCREMENT specialNumberCount

// Output: The count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors
PRINT specialNumberCount
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input**: We take a positive integer `t` which represents the range within which we need to analyze numbers.
2. **Counting Special Numbers**: We set up a counter `specialNumberCount` to keep track of how many numbers within the range have exactly two distinct prime factors.
3. **Outer Loop**: We loop through each integer from `1` to `t` (inclusive), which we refer to as `currentNumber`.
4. **Inner Logic**:
   - For each `currentNumber`, we initialize a counter `primeFactorCount` to zero and a variable `numberToCheck` set to `currentNumber`.
   - We then loop through potential divisors starting from `2` up to `currentNumber - 1`.
   - Inside this loop, we check if the divisor is a factor of `numberToCheck`. If it is, we increment our `primeFactorCount` and continuously divide `numberToCheck` by this divisor until it no longer divides evenly.
5. **Special Number Check**: After determining how many distinct prime factors a number has, we check if it is exactly two. If so, we increment our special number counter.
6. **Output**: Finally, we print the count of special numbers identified.

This pseudocode accurately reflects the functionality of the original code while maintaining clarity and simplicity for readers who may not be familiar with programming concepts.
