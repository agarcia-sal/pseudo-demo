**Pseudocode: Count Distinct Prime Numbers**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Input** the total number of integers, `t`.

3. **Initialize** a counter for the result, `resultCount`, to 0.

4. **For each integer** from 1 to `t`, do the following:
    - Set a counter, `primeFactorCount`, to 0.
    - Assign the current integer to a variable, `currentNumber`.
    
    5. **For each integer** `divisor` starting from 2 up to `currentNumber - 1`, do the following:
        - **Check if** `currentNumber` is divisible by `divisor`:
            - If true, increase the `primeFactorCount` by 1.
            - **While** `currentNumber` is still divisible by `divisor`, do the following:
                - Divide `currentNumber` by `divisor` (this step reduces `currentNumber` by removing the prime factor).
    
    6. **If** the `primeFactorCount` equals 2, then:
        - Increase the `resultCount` by 1 (this indicates that the integer had exactly two distinct prime factors).

7. **Output** the value of `resultCount`, which represents the count of integers from 1 to `t` that have exactly two distinct prime factors.

8. **End**.
