### Purpose Summary:
The code is designed to count and output the number of prime numbers between 1 and a given integer `t`.

### Pseudocode:
```
BEGIN
    // Get the input from the user for the upper limit
    SET upperLimit to the integer value from user input

    // Initialize a counter to keep track of prime numbers
    SET primeCount to 0

    // Loop through each integer from 1 to upperLimit
    FOR each number from 1 to upperLimit DO
        // Initialize a counter for the number of factors
        SET factorCount to 0

        // Create a variable to hold the current number being checked
        SET currentNumber to the current number in the loop

        // Check for factors starting from 2 up to (but not including) the current number
        FOR each factor from 2 to currentNumber - 1 DO
            // Determine if the current number is divisible by the factor
            IF currentNumber is divisible by factor THEN
                // Increment the factor count since it's a factor
                INCREMENT factorCount by 1

                // Divide the current number by the factor as long as it is divisible
                WHILE currentNumber is divisible by factor DO
                    DIVIDE currentNumber by factor
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR

        // A number is prime if it has exactly 2 factors: 1 and itself
        IF factorCount is equal to 2 THEN
            // Increment the prime count
            INCREMENT primeCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Output the total number of prime numbers found
    PRINT primeCount
END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Input Handling:** The program starts by receiving a single integer from the user that establishes the upper limit to check for primes.
- **Counting Logic:** For each integer from 1 to the upper limit, it checks how many distinct factors (not counting 1 or itself) the number has.
- **Prime Detection:** If a number has exactly two distinct factors, it is classified as a prime number, and a prime counter is incremented.
- **Output:** Finally, the total count of prime numbers up to the user-provided number is printed out. 

This pseudocode avoids specific programming syntax while emphasizing clarity and logic, making it accessible to readers with varying levels of programming experience.
