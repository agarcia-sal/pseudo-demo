### Purpose
The purpose of this code is to count and output the number of prime numbers between 1 and a specified upper limit.

### Pseudocode

```
START

// Step 1: Get the upper limit for prime number search from the user
DEFINE upperLimit AS INTEGER
PRINT "Enter an upper limit:"
READ upperLimit

// Step 2: Initialize a variable to keep track of the count of prime numbers
DEFINE primeCount AS INTEGER
SET primeCount TO 0

// Step 3: Loop through all numbers from 1 to the upper limit
FOR each number FROM 1 TO upperLimit DO
    // Step 4: Initialize a counter for prime factors
    DEFINE factorCount AS INTEGER
    SET factorCount TO 0
    
    // Step 5: Set a temporary variable to check divisibility
    DEFINE currentNum AS INTEGER
    SET currentNum TO number

    // Step 6: Check for factors from 2 up to (but not including) the current number
    FOR each potentialFactor FROM 2 TO (number - 1) DO
        // Step 7: If the current number is divisible by the potential factor
        IF (currentNum MOD potentialFactor IS 0) THEN
            // Increase the count of factors found
            INCREMENT factorCount BY 1
            
            // Keep dividing the current number by the potential factor 
            // until it is no longer divisible
            WHILE (currentNum MOD potentialFactor IS 0) DO
                SET currentNum TO currentNum / potentialFactor
            END WHILE
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 8: Check if the number has exactly 2 factors (indicating it is prime)
    IF (factorCount IS EQUAL TO 1) THEN
        // Step 9: If it is prime, increment the prime count
        INCREMENT primeCount BY 1
    END IF
END FOR

// Step 10: Output the total count of prime numbers
PRINT "Total prime numbers between 1 and", upperLimit, "is:", primeCount

END
```

### Comments
- **Input Handling:** The program begins by asking for user input to define the upper limit, where users must enter a number.
- **Main Logic:** The code systematically checks each number for factors, counting how many factors it has. If a number has only one distinct prime factor after processing, it is determined to be prime.
- **Output:** At the end, the code displays the total count of prime numbers found, giving clear feedback regarding the process results. 

### Example Structures
The pseudocode is structured to clearly convey each logical step in the process while utilizing descriptive variable names to provide context. This organization enhances readability and understanding for those interested in algorithmic logic without needing to reference programming syntax directly.
