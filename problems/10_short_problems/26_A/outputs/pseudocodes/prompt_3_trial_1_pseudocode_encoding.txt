Here is the translated pseudocode based on the provided code snippet:

```
1. Initialize a variable 'total' to hold the number of prime numbers found. (Set total = 0)

2. Read an integer input 't' which represents the range (1 to t).

3. Loop through each integer 'currentNumber' from 1 to 't':
    a. Initialize a variable 'divisorCount' to 0 to count the number of distinct prime factors for 'currentNumber'.
    b. Set 'tempNumber' equal to 'currentNumber' for factorization.

    c. Loop through each integer 'potentialFactor' from 2 to 'currentNumber - 1':
        i. Check if 'tempNumber' is divisible by 'potentialFactor':
            - If yes:
                - Increment 'divisorCount' by 1 (indicating a new prime factor found).
                - Continuously divide 'tempNumber' by 'potentialFactor' until 'tempNumber' is no longer divisible by 'potentialFactor'.

    d. After checking all potential factors:
        - If 'divisorCount' equals 2, increment 'total' by 1 (indicating that 'currentNumber' is a prime number).

4. After processing all numbers, output the value of 'total', which represents the count of prime numbers in the specified range.
```

This pseudocode summarizes the logic of counting the prime numbers up to a given integer 't' while emphasizing clarity and understanding of the processes involved.
