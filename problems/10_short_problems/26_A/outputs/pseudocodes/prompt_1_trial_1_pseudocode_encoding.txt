**Pseudocode:**

1. Read an integer value `t` from input.
   
2. Initialize a variable `result` to 0, which will count the number of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors.

3. For each integer `i` from 1 to `t` (inclusive):
   - Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will count the number of distinct prime factors for the current integer `i`.
   - Set `number` to the value of `i`.

   4. For each integer `j` from 2 to `i-1` (inclusive):
      - Check if `number` is divisible by `j`:
        - If true, increase `count` by 1 (indicating a new prime factor has been found).
        - Keep dividing `number` by `j` until `number` is no longer divisible by `j`.

   5. After checking all potential factors (from `2` to `i-1`):
      - If `count` is equal to 2 (which means `i` has exactly two distinct prime factors):
        - Increase `result` by 1.

6. After examining all integers up to `t`, output the value of `result`, which represents the count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors.
