**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN 
    // Step 1: Read an integer input
    SET t TO integer input

    // Step 2: Initialize result counter
    SET res TO 0

    // Step 3: Loop through numbers from 1 to t
    FOR i FROM 1 TO t DO
        // Step 4: Initialize a count for prime factorization
        SET cnt TO 0
        SET num TO i
        
        // Step 5: Loop through potential factors from 2 to i-1
        FOR j FROM 2 TO i - 1 DO
            // Step 6: Check if j is a factor of num
            IF (num MOD j EQUALS 0) THEN
                // Step 7: Increment the count of distinct prime factors
                INCREMENT cnt BY 1
                // Step 8: Divide num by j as long as it is a factor
                WHILE (num MOD j EQUALS 0) DO
                    SET num TO num / j
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR

        // Step 9: Check if exactly two distinct prime factors were found
        IF (cnt EQUALS 2) THEN
            // Step 10: Increment the result counter for finding a number with exactly two distinct prime factors
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 11: Print the total count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors
    PRINT res
END
```

**Assumptions:**
- The input value `t` is a positive integer.
- The counting for distinct prime factors starts from 2, as it is the smallest prime number.
- The operations `MOD` and division are valid for the given data types (integers).
