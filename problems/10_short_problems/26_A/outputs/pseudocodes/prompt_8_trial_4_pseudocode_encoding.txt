**Purpose**: This code counts how many numbers from 1 to a given number (t) are classified as semiprime numbers. A semiprime number is defined as a natural number that can be expressed as the product of exactly two prime numbers.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Get Input**:
   - Read an integer value `t` from the user, which represents the upper limit of the range to check for semiprime numbers.

2. **Initialize Result**:
   - Set a variable `semiprime_count` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of semiprime numbers found.

3. **Iterate Through Each Number**:
   - For each number `current_number` from 1 to `t` (inclusive):
     - Initialize a variable `prime_factor_count` to 0. This will count the distinct prime factors of `current_number`.
     - Set `factor_test_number` to `current_number`. This variable will be used for factorization.

4. **Check for Prime Factors**:
   - For each potential prime factor `potential_factor` starting from 2 up to (but not including) `current_number`:
     - If `factor_test_number` is divisible by `potential_factor` (i.e., `factor_test_number` modulo `potential_factor` equals 0):
       - Increment `prime_factor_count` by 1, indicating that one prime factor has been found.
       - While `factor_test_number` is still divisible by `potential_factor`:
         - Divide `factor_test_number` by `potential_factor`, effectively removing that prime factor.

5. **Check for Semiprime Condition**:
   - After checking all potential prime factors:
     - If `prime_factor_count` is equal to 2 (indicating exactly two distinct prime factors were found):
       - Increment `semiprime_count` by 1.

6. **Output Result**:
   - After finishing all iterations, print the value of `semiprime_count`, which is the total count of semiprime numbers between 1 and `t`.

**Example of Execution**:
- When the user inputs `10`, the program will check the numbers 1 through 10, find the semiprime numbers (e.g., 4, 6, 9, 10), and then output the total count of these semiprimes.

### Summary of the Algorithm:
```
Input: t (integer)
semiprime_count = 0

For each number current_number from 1 to t:
    prime_factor_count = 0
    factor_test_number = current_number

    For each potential_factor from 2 to current_number - 1:
        If factor_test_number is divisible by potential_factor:
            Increment prime_factor_count
            While factor_test_number is divisible by potential_factor:
                Divide factor_test_number by potential_factor

    If prime_factor_count equals 2:
        Increment semiprime_count

Output semiprime_count
```
