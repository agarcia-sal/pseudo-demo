**Purpose:** This algorithm counts the number of prime numbers up to a specified integer.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
  
2. **Get the Input:**
   - Read an integer value from the user. This value represents the upper limit (referred to as 'total') for the search for prime numbers.

3. **Initialize Count of Prime Numbers:**
   - Set a variable named 'primeCount' to 0. This will keep track of how many prime numbers are found.

4. **Iterate Through Possible Numbers:**
   - For each integer 'currentNumber' from 1 to 'total':
     1. Set a variable 'divisorCount' to 0. This will count how many divisors 'currentNumber' has.
     2. Set a variable 'workingNum' equal to 'currentNumber'. This number will be used for checking divisibility.
     
     3. **Check for Divisibility:**
        - For each integer 'potentialDivisor' from 2 to one less than 'currentNumber':
            - If 'workingNum' is divisible by 'potentialDivisor':
              1. Increment 'divisorCount' by 1.
              2. Divide 'workingNum' by 'potentialDivisor' until 'workingNum' is no longer divisible by 'potentialDivisor'.
          
     4. **Determine if Prime:**
        - If 'divisorCount' equals 2, increment 'primeCount' by 1. (This indicates that 'currentNumber' is prime).

5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the value of 'primeCount'.

6. **End Program**

This pseudocode provides a clear and human-readable abstraction of the original code, maintaining the logical structure while enhancing clarity and accessibility for the reader.
