**Context:**
- **Purpose:** The function counts how many semi-prime numbers exist up to the given input number. A semi-prime number is defined as the product of exactly two prime numbers.
- **Input and Output:** The function takes a single integer as input and returns the count of semi-prime numbers.
- **Control Structures:** 
  - The outer loop iterates through each integer from 1 to the input number.
  - The inner loop checks for prime factors and the inner while loop repeatedly divides the number by its factors.
- **Clarity:** The pseudocode uses descriptive names and clear conditional checks to ensure it is understandable.
