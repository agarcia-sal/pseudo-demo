**Purpose of the Code:**
The code is designed to count how many numbers in the range from 1 to a specified limit are semiprime numbers (numbers that are the product of exactly two prime numbers).

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Take an integer input which represents the upper limit for counting semiprime numbers.
    SET upper_limit TO integer input

    // Initialize a counter to keep track of semiprime numbers found.
    SET semiprime_count TO 0

    // Loop through each number from 1 to upper limit.
    FOR each number FROM 1 TO upper_limit DO
      
        SET prime_factor_count TO 0  // Counter for counting distinct prime factors
        SET current_number TO current number being evaluated

        // Loop through all numbers starting from 2 up to the current number to check for factors.
        FOR each potential_factor FROM 2 TO current_number - 1 DO
            // If the current number is divisible by the potential factor.
            IF current_number IS divisible BY potential_factor THEN
                INCREMENT prime_factor_count // Increase the distinct prime factors count
              
                // While it's divisible, continuously divide the current number by this factor.
                WHILE current_number IS divisible BY potential_factor DO
                    DIVIDE current_number BY potential_factor
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR

        // Check if exactly two distinct prime factors were found.
        IF prime_factor_count EQUALS 2 THEN
            INCREMENT semiprime_count // Found a semiprime number, increase the count
        END IF

    END FOR

    // Output the total count of semiprime numbers found.
    PRINT semiprime_count

END
```

**Key Points Explained:**
- **Input Handling:** The program starts by accepting an integer input representing the upper limit.
- **Main Logic:** It iterates through each number up to the given limit, checking for distinct prime factors.
- **Count of Prime Factors:** It counts how many distinct prime factors each number has, adding to the semiprime count only when there are exactly two.
- **Output:** Finally, it prints the total count of semiprime numbers within the specified range. 

This pseudocode retains the core functions of the original code while ensuring clarity and ease of understanding for readers.
