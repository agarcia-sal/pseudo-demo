**Purpose**: This code counts how many numbers between 1 and a given number (t) are exactly the product of two prime numbers.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Get Input**: 
   - Read an integer value from the user and store it in the variable **totalNumbers**.

3. **Initialize Count**:
   - Set **result** to 0. This variable will keep track of how many numbers meet the criteria.

4. **Iterate Through Numbers**:
   - For each number **currentNumber** from 1 to **totalNumbers**:
     a. Initialize a variable **primeFactorCount** to 0 to count how many distinct prime factors the current number has.
     b. Set **tempNumber** to **currentNumber** to work with.

5. **Check for Prime Factors**:
   - For each potential factor **potentialFactor** starting from 2 up to **currentNumber - 1**:
     a. Check if **tempNumber** is divisible by **potentialFactor**:
        - If it is:
           i. Increment **primeFactorCount** by 1 because we found a new prime factor.
           ii. While **tempNumber** is divisible by **potentialFactor**, divide **tempNumber** by **potentialFactor** to remove all occurrences of this factor.

6. **Evaluate Condition**:
   - After checking all potential factors, if **primeFactorCount** equals 2:
     - Increment **result** by 1 because we found a number that is the product of exactly two primes.

7. **Output the Result**:
   - After finishing the loop, print the value of **result** to show how many numbers are products of exactly two prime numbers.

8. **End Program**
