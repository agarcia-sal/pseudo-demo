**Purpose:** The code is designed to count how many numbers within a specified range (from 1 to a given number) are classified as prime numbers.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Define the Input:**
   - Read an integer value called `totalNumbers` which represents the upper limit of the range.

3. **Initialize Count:**
   - Set a variable `primeCount` to 0. This will keep track of the number of prime numbers found.

4. **Iterate Over Each Number:**
   - For each integer `currentNumber` from 1 to `totalNumbers` (inclusive):
     - Set a variable `divisorCount` to 0. This counts the number of divisors found for the current number.
     - Set a variable `tempNumber` equal to `currentNumber`. This will be used to check for divisibility.

5. **Check for Divisibility:**
   - For each integer `potentialDivisor` from 2 to `currentNumber - 1`:
     - If `tempNumber` is divisible by `potentialDivisor`:
       - Increase `divisorCount` by 1 (this indicates a found divisor).
       - While `tempNumber` is still divisible by `potentialDivisor`:
         - Divide `tempNumber` by `potentialDivisor`. (This reduces the number to continue checking for more divisibility.)

6. **Determine If Prime:**
   - If `divisorCount` equals 2 (indicating one divisor found is the number itself, and the other is 1):
     - Increase `primeCount` by 1 (confirming that the current number is prime).

7. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the value of `primeCount`, which represents the total number of prime numbers up to `totalNumbers`.

8. **End**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The check for `divisorCount` equaling 2 is crucial, as it defines the prime number condition (being divisible only by 1 and itself).
- Dividing `tempNumber` by its `potentialDivisor` in a loop helps to factor the number completely out of smaller prime divisors until it can't be divided any further.
