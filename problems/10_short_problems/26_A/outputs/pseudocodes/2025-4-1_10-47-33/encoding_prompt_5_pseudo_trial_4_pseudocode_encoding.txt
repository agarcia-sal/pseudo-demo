**Purpose:** The primary goal of this code is to count how many numbers from 1 to a specified limit are semiprime numbers. A semiprime is defined as a natural number that is the product of exactly two prime numbers.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start:**
   - Read an integer value as the upper limit (referred to as `limit`).

2. **Initialize Count:**
   - Set a variable called `semiprimeCount` to 0. This will keep track of how many semiprime numbers are found.

3. **Loop through Numbers:**
   - For each integer `currentNumber` starting from 1 up to `limit` (inclusive):
     - Initialize a variable `primeFactorCount` to 0. This will count the distinct prime factors of the current number.
     - Set `numberToCheck` to the value of `currentNumber`.
     
4. **Find Prime Factors:**
   - For each integer `potentialPrime` starting from 2 up to `currentNumber - 1`:
     - Check if `numberToCheck` is divisible by `potentialPrime`:
       - If true, increment `primeFactorCount` by 1 (indicating a prime factor has been found).
       - While `numberToCheck` is still divisible by `potentialPrime`, repeatedly divide `numberToCheck` by `potentialPrime` until it is no longer divisible. This step reduces `numberToCheck` to potentially divide it by the next prime factor.
     
5. **Check for Semiprime:**
   - After processing all potential prime factors, check if `primeFactorCount` equals 2:
     - If true, increment `semiprimeCount` by 1 (indicating that `currentNumber` is a semiprime).

6. **Output Result:**
   - After checking all numbers up to `limit`, print the value of `semiprimeCount`.

**Comments:**
- This pseudocode effectively captures the process of identifying semiprime numbers by focusing on counting distinct prime factors of each number in the given range. 
- The use of descriptive variable names enhances clarity, helping readers to understand the purpose of each component in the algorithm. 

**Example Structure:**

```
START
    READ limit FROM user
    SET semiprimeCount TO 0

    FOR currentNumber FROM 1 TO limit DO
        SET primeFactorCount TO 0
        SET numberToCheck TO currentNumber

        FOR potentialPrime FROM 2 TO (currentNumber - 1) DO
            IF numberToCheck MOD potentialPrime EQUALS 0 THEN
                INCREMENT primeFactorCount
                WHILE numberToCheck MOD potentialPrime EQUALS 0 DO
                    numberToCheck = numberToCheck / potentialPrime
                END WHILE
            END IF
        END FOR

        IF primeFactorCount EQUALS 2 THEN
            INCREMENT semiprimeCount
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    PRINT semiprimeCount
END
``` 

This pseudocode clearly lays out the logic involved in counting semiprime numbers, while avoiding specifics of programming syntax to ensure accessibility to a wider audience.
