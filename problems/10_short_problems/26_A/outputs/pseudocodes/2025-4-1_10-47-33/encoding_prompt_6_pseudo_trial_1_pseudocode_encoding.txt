Here is the pseudocode derived from the provided code, capturing the algorithm's logic in a clear and understandable manner:

```
1. Start the program
2. Read an integer value 't' from the user
3. Initialize a variable 'result' to zero

4. For each integer 'i' from 1 to 't' (inclusive):
    a. Initialize a count variable 'count' to zero
    b. Set 'currentNumber' to 'i'
    
    5. For each integer 'j' from 2 to (i - 1):
        a. Check if 'currentNumber' is divisible by 'j'
        b. If 'currentNumber' is divisible by 'j':
            i. Increment 'count' by 1
            
            ii. While 'currentNumber' is divisible by 'j':
                1. Divide 'currentNumber' by 'j' to remove the factor
    
    6. If 'count' is equal to 2:
        a. Increment 'result' by 1

7. Output the value of 'result'
8. End the program
```

### Breakdown of the Logic:
- The program begins by taking an integer input 't' which determines the range of numbers to check.
- It initializes a variable to keep track of how many numbers meet specific criteria.
- For each number from 1 to 't', it checks how many unique prime factors it has by attempting to divide the number by every integer from 2 up to that number.
- If exactly two unique prime factors are found for a number, a counter is incremented.
- Finally, the program outputs the total count of numbers that have exactly two unique prime factors.
