**Purpose**: The goal of the code is to count how many numbers between 1 and a given number \( t \) are exactly the product of two distinct prime numbers.

**Pseudocode**:

```
BEGIN

    // Read the input value
    SET inputNumber TO the integer value from user input

    // Initialize a variable to count the desired numbers
    SET countOfNumbers TO 0
    
    // Loop through each number from 1 to inputNumber
    FOR each currentNumber FROM 1 TO inputNumber DO
        
        // Initialize a counter to track the number of distinct prime factors
        SET distinctPrimeCount TO 0
        
        // Create a variable to work with currentNumber
        SET workingNumber TO currentNumber
        
        // Check for prime factors starting from 2 up to currentNumber - 1
        FOR each potentialFactor FROM 2 TO currentNumber - 1 DO
            
            // If potentialFactor is a factor of workingNumber
            IF (workingNumber MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0) THEN
                
                // Increase the count of distinct prime factors
                INCREMENT distinctPrimeCount
                
                // Divide workingNumber by potentialFactor until it is no longer divisible
                WHILE (workingNumber MOD potentialFactor EQUALS 0) DO
                    SET workingNumber TO workingNumber DIVIDED BY potentialFactor
                
                END WHILE
            END IF
            
        END FOR
        
        // Check if the number has exactly two distinct prime factors
        IF (distinctPrimeCount EQUALS 2) THEN
            
            // Increase the overall count of such numbers
            INCREMENT countOfNumbers
        
        END IF
        
    END FOR

    // Output the result, which is the count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors
    PRINT countOfNumbers

END
```

**Explanation of Logic**:
1. The code begins by accepting an input number \( t \).
2. It initializes a counter to keep track of numbers meeting the criteria.
3. It then iterates through each number from 1 to \( t \).
4. For each number, it checks for prime factors starting from 2 up to just before the number itself.
5. It counts how many distinct prime factors each number has.
6. If a number has exactly two distinct prime factors, it adds one to the overall count.
7. Finally, it prints the total count of numbers that meet the criteria.
