**Purpose:**  
The objective of this code is to calculate and display the total number of prime numbers from 1 to a given integer `t`.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter an integer value for `t`.
   - Store this value as `t`.

2. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Create a variable named `primeCount` and set it to 0. This will hold the number of prime numbers found.

3. **Loop Through Each Number:**
   - For each number `currentNumber` starting from 1 up to `t` (inclusive):
     - Create a variable `divisorCount` and set it to 0. This will count the number of divisors for `currentNumber`.
     - Create a variable `remainingValue` and set it to `currentNumber`. This will be used for factorization.

4. **Check for Divisibility:**
     - For each `potentialDivisor` starting from 2 up to `currentNumber - 1`:
       - If `remainingValue` is divisible by `potentialDivisor`:
         - Increase `divisorCount` by 1.
         - While `remainingValue` is still divisible by `potentialDivisor`:
           - Divide `remainingValue` by `potentialDivisor` (this step removes all occurrences of `potentialDivisor` from `remainingValue`).

5. **Determine if Prime:**
   - After checking all potential divisors:
     - If `divisorCount` equals 2 (indicating that `currentNumber` is prime):
       - Increase `primeCount` by 1.

6. **Output Result:**
   - Print the final count of prime numbers found (`primeCount`).

**Example Structure:**

```plaintext
1. INPUT: Get integer t from user.
2. SET primeCount to 0
3. FOR currentNumber FROM 1 TO t DO
    a. SET divisorCount to 0
    b. SET remainingValue to currentNumber
    c. FOR potentialDivisor FROM 2 TO currentNumber - 1 DO
        i. IF remainingValue is divisible by potentialDivisor THEN
            A. Increment divisorCount by 1
            B. WHILE remainingValue is divisible by potentialDivisor DO
                I. Divide remainingValue by potentialDivisor
    d. IF divisorCount equals 2 THEN
        i. Increment primeCount by 1
4. OUTPUT: Display primeCount
```

**Comments:**  
- The code starts with an input step to gather user data.
- It initializes a counter for prime numbers to zero.
- The outer loop iterates through each number, while the inner loop counts the divisors and checks if the number is prime.
- Finally, it outputs how many prime numbers were counted, which serves as the primary result of the program.
