**Pseudocode: Count Prime Numbers**

1. **Initialize the variable for the number of test cases:**
   - Read integer `t` from user input.

2. **Initialize a variable to store the count of prime numbers:**
   - Set variable `res` to 0.

3. **Loop through each number from 1 to `t`:**
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to `t`:
     - Initialize a counter `cnt` to 0.
     - Set variable `num` to `i`.

4. **Check for factors of `num`:**
   - For each integer `j` from 2 to `i-1`:
     - If `num` is divisible by `j` (num % j equals 0):
       - Increment `cnt` by 1.
       - While `num` is divisible by `j` (num % j equals 0):
         - Divide `num` by `j`.

5. **Determine if `i` is a prime number:**
   - If `cnt` equals 2:
     - Increment `res` by 1.

6. **Output the total count of prime numbers found:**
   - Print the value of `res`. 

**Assumptions:**
- `t` is a positive integer (greater than 1).
- The program correctly identifies prime numbers, which have exactly 2 distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself.
