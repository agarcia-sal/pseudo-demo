### Purpose
The main objective of the code is to count how many numbers from 1 to a given number (inclusive) are semiprime. A semiprime is defined as a natural number that is the product of exactly two prime numbers.

### Pseudocode

1. **Start**
  
2. **Input**
   - Get a number `t` from the user, which indicates the range of positive integers to check for semiprimes (from 1 to `t`).

3. **Initialize a Counter**
   - Set a variable `semiprime_count` to 0. This will keep track of how many semiprimes are found.

4. **Iterate Through Each Number**
   - For each integer `current_number` from 1 to `t`:
     - Initialize a variable `factor_count` to 0. This will count the distinct prime factors of `current_number`.
     - Set a variable `temp_number` to `current_number`.

     - **Find Prime Factors**
       - For each integer `possible_prime` from 2 to `current_number - 1`:
         - If `temp_number` is divisible by `possible_prime`:
           - Increment `factor_count` by 1.
           
           - **Reduce Temp Number**
           - While `temp_number` can still be divided by `possible_prime` (meaning `temp_number` is divisible by `possible_prime`):
             - Divide `temp_number` by `possible_prime`.

     - **Check for Semiprime**
     - If `factor_count` equals 2 (this means that `current_number` has exactly two prime factors):
       - Increment `semiprime_count` by 1.

5. **Output the Result**
   - Print the value of `semiprime_count`, which represents the total number of semiprimes from 1 to `t`.

6. **End**

### Annotations
- The outer loop checks each number individually.
- The inner loop finds all unique prime factors of each current number, ensuring no double counting of the same prime factor.
- The count of distinct prime factors is crucial to determining if a number is semiprime.
- This approach avoids heavy technical terms, focusing on general logic and simple structure to enhance readability. 

This pseudocode should be easy to understand for those who might not be familiar with programming syntax or specific coding practices.
