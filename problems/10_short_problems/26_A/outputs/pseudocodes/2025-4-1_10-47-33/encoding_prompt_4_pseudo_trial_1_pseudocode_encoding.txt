```plaintext
1. Read integer input as `t`
2. Initialize a variable `result` to 0

3. FOR each integer `i` from 1 to `t` (inclusive)
    a. Initialize a variable `count` to 0
    b. Set `number` to `i`
    
    4. FOR each integer `j` from 2 to `i-1`
        a. IF `number` is divisible by `j`
            i. Increment `count` by 1
            ii. WHILE `number` is divisible by `j`
                - Divide `number` by `j`
    
    5. IF `count` is equal to 2 THEN
        a. Increment `result` by 1

6. Output `result`
```

### Comments:
- This pseudocode counts the numbers from 1 to `t` that have exactly two distinct prime factors.
