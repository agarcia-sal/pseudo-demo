### Pseudocode for Prime Count Algorithm

```
# Accept an input integer 't' representing the upper limit
INPUT upperLimit

# Initialize a variable to track the count of prime numbers
INITIALIZE primeCount to 0

# Loop through all integer values from 1 to upperLimit (inclusive)
FOR each number from 1 to upperLimit DO
    # Initialize a counter for the number of unique prime factors
    INITIALIZE uniquePrimeFactorCount to 0
    
    # Set the current number to evaluate for prime factors
    SET currentNumber to the current number in the loop

    # Check for prime factors starting from 2 up to (but not including) the current number
    FOR each potentialPrimeFactor from 2 to (currentNumber - 1) DO
        # If the current number is divisible by the potential prime factor
        IF currentNumber is divisible by potentialPrimeFactor THEN
            # Increment the count of unique prime factors
            INCREMENT uniquePrimeFactorCount by 1
            
            # Divide currentNumber by potentialPrimeFactor until it's no longer divisible
            WHILE currentNumber is divisible by potentialPrimeFactor DO
                DIVIDE currentNumber by potentialPrimeFactor
            
    # If exactly two unique prime factors were found, it indicates the number is prime
    IF uniquePrimeFactorCount is equal to 2 THEN
        # Increment the total count of prime numbers
        INCREMENT primeCount by 1

# Output the total count of prime numbers found
PRINT primeCount
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by obtaining an integer input, `upperLimit`, which defines the range of numbers to evaluate for primality.

2. **Initialization**: A counter, `primeCount`, is initialized to keep track of how many prime numbers are found.

3. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates through each number from 1 to `upperLimit`.

4. **Unique Prime Factor Counting**: For each number, a counter for unique prime factors is set up. The inner loop checks potential prime factors starting from 2 up to one less than the current number.

5. **Divisibility Check**: If the current number can be evenly divided by a potential prime factor, the unique prime factor counter is incremented, and the current number is subsequently divided by this factor until it is no longer divisible by it.

6. **Prime Identification**: After checking all potential factors, if exactly two unique prime factors have been counted, the counter `primeCount` is incremented, indicating that the current number is likely a prime.

7. **Output**: Finally, the total count of identified prime numbers is printed. 

This breakdown makes the algorithm's steps easy to follow, while retaining clarity in the logic behind how prime numbers are counted.
