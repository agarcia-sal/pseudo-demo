**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**  
2. **Input** the number of test cases `t` (an integer).

3. **Initialize** a variable `result` to 0. This will hold the count of numbers with exactly 2 distinct prime factors.

4. **For each number `i` from 1 to `t`** do the following:
   - **Initialize** a variable `count` to 0. This will count the distinct prime factors of `i`.
   - **Set** a variable `number` equal to `i` (to manipulate without altering `i`).
   
   - **For each number `j` from 2 to `i-1`** do the following:
     - **Check** if `number` is divisible by `j`:
       - If true, increment `count` by 1 (a new prime factor found).
       
       - **While** `number` is divisible by `j`, do the following:
         - Divide `number` by `j` (to remove the factor completely).
         
   - **After examining all potential factors**, check if `count` is equal to 2:
     - If true, increment `result` by 1 (indicating `i` has exactly 2 distinct prime factors).

5. **Output** the value of `result` (the count of numbers with exactly 2 distinct prime factors from 1 to `t`).

6. **End**.
