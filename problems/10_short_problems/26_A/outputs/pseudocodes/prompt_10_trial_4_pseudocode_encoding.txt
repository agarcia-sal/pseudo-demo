**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
  
2. **Input Handling:**
   - Prompt user for an integer input and store it in variable `t`
  
3. **Initialize Result:**
   - Set `res` to 0 (This will hold the count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors)

4. **Loop through Numbers:**
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to `t` inclusive:
     - Initialize a counter `cnt` to 0 (This counts the distinct prime factors of `i`)
     - Set `num` to the value of `i`

     - **Check for Prime Factors:**
       - For each integer `j` from 2 to `i-1`:
         - If `num` is divisible by `j` (i.e., `num % j == 0`):
           - Increment `cnt` by 1 (Found a distinct prime factor)
           - **Divide Out Prime Factor:**
             - While `num` is divisible by `j`:
               - Divide `num` by `j`
  
     - **Check Count of Distinct Factors:**
       - If `cnt` equals 2:
         - Increment `res` by 1 (Found a number with exactly two distinct prime factors)

5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the value of `res` (This is the count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors)

6. **End Program**

### **Assumptions:**
- The input `t` is a positive integer.
- The algorithm assumes that any number less than 2 does not have two distinct prime factors.
