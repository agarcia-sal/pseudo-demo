## Purpose Summary
The purpose of this program is to count the number of prime numbers from 1 to a specified number (inclusive). A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
START

// Accept a number as input which specifies the range for checking prime numbers
SET limit AS integer input from the user

// Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of prime numbers found
SET primeCount AS 0

// Loop through each number from 1 to the limit
FOR each number from 1 to limit DO
    SET divisorCount AS 0      // Counter to keep track of how many divisors the current number has
    SET currentNumber AS current number in the loop

    // Loop through possible divisors starting from 2 up to one less than the current number
    FOR each potential divisor from 2 to (currentNumber - 1) DO
        // Check if the current number is divisible by the potential divisor
        IF currentNumber MOD potentialDivisor = 0 THEN
            INCREMENT divisorCount by 1  // Found a divisor, increase the count
            // Keep dividing the current number by the potential divisor until it can no longer be divided
            WHILE currentNumber MOD potentialDivisor = 0 DO
                SET currentNumber AS currentNumber / potentialDivisor

    // A prime number should have exactly two divisors: 1 and itself
    IF divisorCount = 2 THEN
        INCREMENT primeCount by 1   // Increment the prime number counter

// Output the total count of prime numbers found
PRINT primeCount

END
```

## Explanation of Key Parts
- The program starts by reading an integer input which defines the upper limit for checking for prime numbers.
- It initializes a counter to record how many prime numbers it finds.
- For each number in the range from 1 to the specified limit, it checks all potential divisors (starting from 2 up to one less than the number itself) to determine how many divisors the number has.
- If a number has exactly two divisors (indicating it is prime), it increments the prime number count.
- Finally, it outputs the total number of prime numbers identified within the given range. 

## Comments for Clarity
- The loop checks divisibility and counts factors, which is essential for identifying primes.
- The while loop reduces the number by dividing it, handling cases where a number might be divisible multiple times by the same factor.

This structure and approach ensure clear logic and easy understanding of how to identify prime numbers using straightforward counting and condition checking.
