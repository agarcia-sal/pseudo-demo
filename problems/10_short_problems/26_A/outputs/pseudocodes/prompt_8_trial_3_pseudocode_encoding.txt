**Purpose Summary**: The primary goal of this code is to count the number of prime numbers from 1 to a specified number `t`.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start**: Define a variable `t` to receive an integer input from the user, representing the upper limit for checking prime numbers.

2. **Initialize a Result Counter**: Set a variable `primeCount` to 0. This will keep track of how many prime numbers are found.

3. **Loop Through Each Number**: 
   - For each integer `i` starting from 1 up to and including `t`:
     - Initialize a variable `divisorCount` to 0 to count the number of divisors for the current number `i`.
     - Copy the value of `i` to a variable `currentNumber`.

4. **Check for Divisors**:
   - For each integer `j` starting from 2 up to `i` (but not including `i`):
     - If `currentNumber` can be evenly divided by `j` (i.e., the remainder is 0):
       - Increment `divisorCount` by 1.
       - Continue dividing `currentNumber` by `j` until it can no longer be evenly divided by `j` (this means removing all instances of the divisor from `currentNumber`).

5. **Determine Prime Status**:
   - After checking all possible divisors for the current number `i`:
     - If `divisorCount` is equal to 2, it means `i` is a prime number (only divisible by 1 and itself), so:
       - Increment `primeCount` by 1.

6. **Output the Result**: After checking all numbers from 1 to `t`, print the value of `primeCount`, which represents the total number of prime numbers found.

**Breakdown of Logic**:
- Start from 1 to `t`, examine each number.
- Count how many numbers divide evenly (indicating non-primality).
- Count only those with exactly two divisors (1 and itself) as prime.

**Example Structure**:
```plaintext
START
    INPUT t
    SET primeCount = 0
    
    FOR i FROM 1 TO t
        SET divisorCount = 0
        SET currentNumber = i
        
        FOR j FROM 2 TO (i - 1)
            IF currentNumber MOD j == 0
                INCREMENT divisorCount
                WHILE currentNumber MOD j == 0
                    DIVIDE currentNumber BY j
            
        IF divisorCount == 2
            INCREMENT primeCount
    
    PRINT primeCount
END
```

This pseudocode maintains the overall logic of counting primes and is structured clearly for easy understanding.
