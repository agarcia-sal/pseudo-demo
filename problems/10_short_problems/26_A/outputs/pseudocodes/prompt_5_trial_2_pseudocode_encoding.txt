**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to count how many numbers from 1 to a given target number are exactly the product of two distinct prime numbers.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Accept the target number from user input
    SET targetNumber TO input an integer

    // Step 2: Initialize a counter for valid numbers
    SET validCount TO 0

    // Step 3: Loop through each number starting from 1 to the target number
    FOR currentNumber FROM 1 TO targetNumber DO

        // Initialize a counter for the number of distinct prime factors
        SET distinctPrimeCount TO 0

        // Store the current number to check its prime factors
        SET checkNumber TO currentNumber

        // Step 4: Check for prime factors starting from 2 up to currentNumber - 1
        FOR potentialPrime FROM 2 TO currentNumber - 1 DO
            // If potentialPrime is a factor of checkNumber
            IF (checkNumber MOD potentialPrime EQUALS 0) THEN
                // Increment the distinct prime factors counter
                INCREMENT distinctPrimeCount BY 1

                // Step 5: Divide checkNumber by potentialPrime until it is no longer divisible
                WHILE (checkNumber MOD potentialPrime EQUALS 0) DO
                    SET checkNumber TO checkNumber DIVIDED BY potentialPrime

                // End of while loop
            END IF
        // End of for loop

        // Step 6: Check if the current number has exactly two distinct prime factors
        IF (distinctPrimeCount EQUALS 2) THEN
            // Increment the count of valid numbers
            INCREMENT validCount BY 1
        END IF

    // End of outer for loop

    // Step 7: Output the total count of numbers with exactly two distinct prime factors
    PRINT validCount

END
```

### Comments to Enhance Understanding:
- This pseudocode maintains a clear structure for counting numbers made from two distinct primes.
- Each significant step is broken down for clarity, making it easier to follow the logic of the original code.
- Variable names are chosen to reflect their purpose, such as `targetNumber`, `validCount`, and `distinctPrimeCount`.
- The use of comments helps guide the reader through the flow and purpose of each section.
