**Purpose Summary:**  
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numbers. It counts how many numbers differ between the two sets and prints "YES" if fewer than three numbers are different; otherwise, it prints "NO".

**Pseudocode:**
```
FUNCTION main
    // Read input from the user
    SET firstInput TO user input
    SET secondInput TO user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstList TO split firstInput into separate values
    SET secondList TO split secondInput into separate values

    // Initialize a counter for different numbers
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through the number lists to compare each number
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        SET firstNumber TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondNumber TO convert secondList[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the current numbers are different
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // Determine the output based on the count of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"

// Call the main function to execute the program
CALL main
```

**Explanation of Key Operations:**
1. **Input Handling:** The program starts by capturing two user inputs which are expected to be strings of numbers.
  
2. **Splitting and Conversion:** The inputs are split into lists of numbers. Each element in these lists is then converted from a string to an integer for comparison.

3. **Comparison Logic:** A loop iterates through the indices of the lists (assuming there are always three numbers). For each index, it checks if the corresponding numbers in the two lists are different and counts these differences.

4. **Result Output:** After comparing, if the count of differences is less than three, the program outputs "YES"; if not, it outputs "NO".

This pseudocode provides a straightforward representation of the original code's logic, making it easier to understand for those not familiar with programming syntax.
