### Purpose Summary
The primary goal of this code is to compare two sets of three integer values, determining how many of the corresponding values differ. Based on the number of differences, it outputs either "YES" or "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of numbers
    SET firstInput TO read user input as a string
    SET secondInput TO read user input as a string
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstSet TO split firstInput into a list of strings
    SET secondSet TO split secondInput into a list of strings
    
    // Initialize a counter for the number of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through each set of three values
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string values to integers for comparison
        SET valueFromFirstSet TO convert firstSet[index] to an integer
        SET valueFromSecondSet TO convert secondSet[index] to an integer
        
        // Check if the two values are not equal
        IF valueFromFirstSet is NOT equal to valueFromSecondSet THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Evaluate the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        // If there are fewer than 3 differences, output "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // If there are 3 or more differences, output "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads two lines of input, which are expected to be space-separated integers.
2. **Splitting Input**: The input strings are split into lists for easy access to individual numbers.
3. **Counting Differences**: A loop is used to iterate through the corresponding values of both sets, comparing them and counting how many are different.
4. **Decision Making**: After checking all three pairs, the program decides whether to print "YES" or "NO" based on how many differences were found.
5. **Function Structure**: The pseudocode uses structured blocks to clearly define the main function and its flow of operations, making it easy to follow.
