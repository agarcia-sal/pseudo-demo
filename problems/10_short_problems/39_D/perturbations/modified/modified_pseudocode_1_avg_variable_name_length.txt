**Purpose**: The program compares two sets of three numerical inputs and determines if they differ in less than three positions. If they do, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read the first line of inputs
    SET firstInput TO user input
    // Read the second line of inputs
    SET secondInput TO user input
    
    // Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SET fir TO split firstInput into words
    SET sec TO split secondInput into words
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Iterate through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current element from string to integer
        SET num1 TO convert fir[index] to integer
        SET num2 TO convert sec[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the two numbers are not equal
        IF num1 is not equal to num2 THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    // Check the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES" // They differ in less than three positions
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO" // They differ in three or more positions
    ENDIF
    
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL main
```

**Explanation of Key Components**:

- **Input Handling**: The program collects two sets of numerical inputs from the user.
- **Comparison Logic**: It splits each input into parts, compares these parts pairwise, and counts how many differences exist.
- **Output Decision**: Based on the count of differences, it decides whether to print "YES" or "NO". If fewer than three differences exist, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". 

This pseudocode is structured to be easy to read and understand while clearly conveying the logic of the original Python code.
