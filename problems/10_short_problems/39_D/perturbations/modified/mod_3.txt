**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION Main()
    // Get user input for two sets of values
    DECLARE firstSet AS STRING
    DECLARE secondSet AS STRING
    
    firstSet = USER INPUT
    secondSet = USER INPUT

    // Split the inputs into separate values
    DECLARE firstValues AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE secondValues AS LIST OF STRINGS

    firstValues = SPLIT firstSet INTO LIST OF STRINGS
    secondValues = SPLIT secondSet INTO LIST OF STRINGS

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Compare each corresponding value in the two sets
    FOR EACH index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE firstNumber AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondNumber AS INTEGER
        
        firstNumber = CONVERT firstValues[index] TO INTEGER
        secondNumber = CONVERT secondValues[index] TO INTEGER

        // If the numbers are different, increase the difference count
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if sets are similar based on the difference count
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Start the program by calling the Main function
CALL Main()
```

**Explanation of Key Components:**

1. **Input Handling**: The program collects two lines of input from the user, each containing three integers. 

2. **Splitting Strings**: It splits both inputs into lists of strings for easier comparison.

3. **Comparison Loop**: A loop iterates through the list indices (0 to 2), comparing corresponding values from each set. If a pair of values is different, a counter for differences is incremented.

4. **Conditional Logic**: After all comparisons, the program checks the total count of differences. If there are fewer than three differences, it outputs "YES" indicating similarity; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

5. **Calls and Execution**: The program starts executing from the `Main` function, which encapsulates the entire logic flow.
