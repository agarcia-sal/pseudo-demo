**Purpose:** The code checks the number of different and similar values between two sets of three user-provided integers and outputs whether the sets are similar based on a specific criterion.

---

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION Main()
    // Get user input for two sets of values
    DECLARE one AS STRING
    DECLARE two AS STRING
    
    one = USER INPUT
    two = USER INPUT

    // Split the inputs into separate values
    DECLARE oneVal AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE twoVal AS LIST OF STRINGS

    oneVal = SPLIT one INTO LIST OF STRINGS
    twoVal = SPLIT two INTO LIST OF STRINGS

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE diff AS INTEGER
    diff = 0 

    // Compare each corresponding value in the two sets
    FOR EACH index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE firstNumber AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondNumber AS INTEGER
        
        firstNumber = CONVERT oneVal[index] TO INTEGER
        secondNumber = CONVERT twoVal[index] TO INTEGER

        // If the numbers are different, increase the difference count
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            diff = diff + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if sets are similar based on the difference count
    IF diff IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Start the program by calling the Main function
CALL Main()
```

**Explanation of Key Components:**

1. **Input Handling**: The program collects two lines of input from the user, each containing three integers. 

2. **Splitting Strings**: It splits both inputs into lists of strings for easier comparison.

3. **Comparison Loop**: A loop iterates through the list indices (0 to 2), comparing corresponding values from each set. If a pair of values is different, a counter for differences is incremented.

4. **Conditional Logic**: After all comparisons, the program checks the total count of differences. If there are fewer than three differences, it outputs "YES" indicating similarity; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

5. **Calls and Execution**: The program starts executing from the `Main` function, which encapsulates the entire logic flow.
