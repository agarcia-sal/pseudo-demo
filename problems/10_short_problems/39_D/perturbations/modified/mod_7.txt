**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION Main()
    DECLARE firstSet AS STRING
    DECLARE secondSet AS STRING
    
    firstSet = USER INPUT
    secondSet = USER INPUT

    DECLARE firstValues AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE secondValues AS LIST OF STRINGS

    firstValues = SPLIT firstSet INTO LIST OF STRINGS
    secondValues = SPLIT secondSet INTO LIST OF STRINGS

    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    FOR EACH index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE firstNumber AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondNumber AS INTEGER
        
        firstNumber = CONVERT firstValues[index] TO INTEGER
        secondNumber = CONVERT secondValues[index] TO INTEGER

        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

CALL Main()
```
