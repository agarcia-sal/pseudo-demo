**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of three values each
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet

    // Split the input lines into lists of string values
    firstValues = SPLIT firstSet INTO A LIST
    secondValues = SPLIT secondSet INTO A LIST

    // Initialize a counter for discrepancies
    discrepancyCount = 0 

    // Loop over the range of the three values (indices 0 to 2)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string values to integers
        firstValue = CONVERT firstValues[index] TO INTEGER
        secondValue = CONVERT secondValues[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the discrepancy counter
            discrepancyCount = discrepancyCount + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the number of discrepancies to determine the output
    IF discrepancyCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function when the program runs
CALL main()
``` 

**Explanation:**
1. The program begins by reading two lines of input that consist of three values each.
2. These lines are split into lists that contain individual values.
3. A counter is initialized to track how many values differ between the two sets.
4. A loop iterates through each of the three values, comparing corresponding items from the two input lists.
5. If a pair of values differs, the discrepancy count is increased.
6. After the loop, if fewer than three discrepancies are found, the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
