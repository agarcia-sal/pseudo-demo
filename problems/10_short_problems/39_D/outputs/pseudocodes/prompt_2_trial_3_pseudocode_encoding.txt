**Pseudocode:**

Begin the program

    Define the main function

        Prompt the user to enter a sequence of three numbers (string format) and store it in variable firstSequence
        Prompt the user to enter another sequence of three numbers (string format) and store it in variable secondSequence

        Split firstSequence into a list of individual number strings and store it in variable splitFirstSequence
        Split secondSequence into a list of individual number strings and store it in variable splitSecondSequence

        Initialize a variable mismatchCount to 0 to track the number of discrepancies

        For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the first three elements)

            Convert the element at the current index in splitFirstSequence to an integer and store it in variable firstNumber
            Convert the element at the current index in splitSecondSequence to an integer and store it in variable secondNumber
            
            If firstNumber is not equal to secondNumber
                Increment mismatchCount by 1

        If mismatchCount is less than 3
            Output "YES"
        Else
            Output "NO"

End the main function

If this script is executed as the main module, call the main function to run the program.
