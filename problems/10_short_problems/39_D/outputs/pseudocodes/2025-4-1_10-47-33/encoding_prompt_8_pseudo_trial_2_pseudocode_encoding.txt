**Objective:** The purpose of this code is to compare two sets of three integers and determine whether they differ by less than three values. If they differ by fewer than three integers, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Function Definition**: Define a function named "compareThreeIntegers" to encapsulate the logic.

2. **Input Handling**: 
    - Prompt the user to enter the first line of integers and store it in a variable called "firstInput".
    - Prompt the user to enter the second line of integers and store it in a variable called "secondInput".

3. **Data Processing**:
    - Split "firstInput" into a list of strings called "firstList".
    - Split "secondInput" into a list of strings called "secondList".

4. **Initialize Difference Counter**:
    - Create a variable named "differenceCount" and set it to 0. This variable will track how many integers differ between the two inputs.

5. **Comparison Loop**:
    - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
        - Convert the item in "firstList" at the current index to an integer and store it in a variable named "firstValue".
        - Convert the item in "secondList" at the same index to an integer and store it in a variable named "secondValue".
        - If "firstValue" is not equal to "secondValue":
            - Increment "differenceCount" by 1.

6. **Condition Check**:
    - If "differenceCount" is less than 3:
        - Output "YES".
    - Otherwise:
        - Output "NO".

7. **Execution**: 
    - Call the function "compareThreeIntegers" to execute the program.

**Pseudocode Example**:

```
FUNCTION compareThreeIntegers
    PROMPT user for input and store as firstInput
    PROMPT user for input and store as secondInput

    SET firstList to split firstInput into a list of strings
    SET secondList to split secondInput into a list of strings

    SET differenceCount to 0

    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        SET firstValue to convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondValue to convert secondList[index] to integer

        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

CALL compareThreeIntegers()
``` 

This pseudocode accurately reflects the logic and structure of the original code while being easy to understand for someone who may not be familiar with programming syntax.
