Here is the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Get two input strings
    INPUT firstString
    INPUT secondString

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstString INTO list firstValues
    SPLIT secondString INTO list secondValues

    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS 0 

    // Loop through each position in the lists (assuming they have exactly 3 elements)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstValue AS INTEGER of firstValues[index]
        SET secondValue AS INTEGER of secondValues[index]

        // Compare the two values
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference count if they are not equal
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
IF currentFileName IS "main.py" THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** It gathers two strings from user input, which are assumed to represent three numerical values each.
2. **String Splitting:** Each input string is divided into components (a list of strings).
3. **Counting Differences:** A loop runs three times to compare corresponding elements from both lists, incrementing a count of differences when they do not match.
4. **Decision Making:** After comparing, it checks if the number of differences is less than three, printing "YES" if true, and "NO" otherwise.
5. **Execution Entry Point:** It defines the entry point for the script, checking if it's being run as the main file before executing the main function.

This pseudocode encapsulates the logic of the original code while maintaining clarity and abstraction, suitable for readers with varying programming backgrounds.
