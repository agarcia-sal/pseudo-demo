Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that translates the provided Python code. It breaks down the logic into clear, descriptive steps, allowing those unfamiliar with code to understand the process.

```plaintext
FUNCTION main
    // Read two lines of input from the user 
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Split the input lines into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList USING SPACE
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList USING SPACE

    // Initialize a variable to count the number of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of the lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string values at the current index to integers
        SET firstValue TO INTEGER value of firstList[index]
        SET secondValue TO INTEGER value of secondList[index]

        // Check if the values from both lists are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // If they are different, increment the difference count
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL main
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling**: It starts by getting two lines of input from the user.
2. **Data Processing**: The input strings are split into lists based on spaces.
3. **Difference Counting**: A loop runs through the first three elements of these lists to compare their integer values. It increments a counter whenever a difference is found.
4. **Conditional Output**: Finally, it checks if the count of differences is less than three and prints "YES" or "NO" based on that check. 

This structure ensures the logic of the original code is maintained while making it easy to understand without requiring knowledge of the specific programming language used.
