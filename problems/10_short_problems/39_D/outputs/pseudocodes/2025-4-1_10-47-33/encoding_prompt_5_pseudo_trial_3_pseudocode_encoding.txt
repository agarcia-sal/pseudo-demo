### Purpose
The goal of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they are similar enough based on the number of differences. If there are fewer than three differences, the program will output "YES"; otherwise, it will output "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION MainProcedure
    // Read the first set of numbers from the user
    SET firstInput AS input from user
    // Read the second set of numbers from the user
    SET secondInput AS input from user
    
    // Split the inputs into lists of individual numbers
    SET firstNumbers AS split firstInput into a list
    SET secondNumbers AS split secondInput into a list
    
    // Initialize a counter for the number of differences
    SET differenceCount AS 0
    
    // Loop through the first three numbers in both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current numbers to integers for comparison
        SET firstNumber AS convert firstNumbers[index] to integer
        SET secondNumber AS convert secondNumbers[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT equal to secondNumber THEN
            // Increment the difference counter if they are different
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check if the number of differences is less than three
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // Print "YES" if there are fewer than three differences
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Print "NO" if there are three or more differences
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program execution by calling the main procedure
CALL MainProcedure
```

### Comments
- The main procedure is designed to encapsulate the core functionality of the program.
- Input is taken from the user in a simple manner, splitting the input strings into manageable pieces for comparison.
- A loop is employed to count the number of differences between the corresponding values in the two lists of numbers, making it very straightforward to follow the logic.
- The final conditional statement yields the output based on the result of the comparison, clearly expressing the two possible outcomes.
