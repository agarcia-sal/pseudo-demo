**Purpose Summary:** This program compares two sets of three integers and determines whether they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main():
    // Prompt the user for input
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = GET user input
    secondInput = GET user input

    // Split the inputs into lists of numbers
    DECLARE firstNumbers AS LIST
    DECLARE secondNumbers AS LIST
    firstNumbers = SPLIT firstInput by spaces
    secondNumbers = SPLIT secondInput by spaces

    // Initialize a variable to count differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0

    // Compare the numbers at each position
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2:
        DECLARE firstNumber AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondNumber AS INTEGER
        firstNumber = CONVERT firstNumbers[index] to INTEGER
        secondNumber = CONVERT secondNumbers[index] to INTEGER
        
        // If the numbers differ, increment the difference count
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN:
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1

    // Determine the result based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN:
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO"

// Start the program
CALL main()
```

**Explanation of Key Parts:**

- **Input Handling:** The program reads two lines of input, which are expected to contain three space-separated integers each.
  
- **Comparison Logic:** It loops through the first three integers of both inputs, counting how many are different.

- **Output Decision:** Finally, it checks if the count of differences is less than three. If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

**Comments for Clarity:**

- Each part of the logic is broken down into meaningful steps, making it clear what the program is doing at each stage.
- Variable names and function names are chosen to reflect their purpose (e.g., `differenceCount` clearly indicates what is being counted).

This structured approach ensures that the pseudocode is understandable to readers regardless of their familiarity with programming.
