Here is the pseudocode that clearly conveys the logic and functionality of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION doMain()

    // Step 1: Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput

    // Step 2: Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Step 4: Iterate over the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstNumber TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondNumber TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Step 5: Compare the two numbers
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Check the number of differences and print the result
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF this file is being executed THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** Two lines of input are read and stored as `firstInput` and `secondInput`.
2. **Splitting Input:** Each input line is split into lists of strings called `firstList` and `secondList`.
3. **Difference Count:** A counter named `differenceCount` is initialized to keep track of how many numbers differ between the two lists.
4. **Loop and Comparison:** A loop iterates through the first three index positions of both lists, comparing elements. If they differ, the counter is incremented.
5. **Conditional Output:** After the loop, the code checks if the `differenceCount` is less than 3 and prints "YES" or "NO" based on that condition.
6. **Function Execution:** The main function is called when the script is executed, which is represented clearly in the entry point section of the pseudocode. 

This pseudocode maintains a high level of abstraction while clearly representing the logic and flow of the original code, making it understandable for someone unfamiliar with it.
