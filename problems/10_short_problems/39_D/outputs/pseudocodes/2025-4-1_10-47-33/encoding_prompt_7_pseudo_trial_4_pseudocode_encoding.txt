Here is the high-level pseudocode that describes the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two input strings from the user
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput
    
    // Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput INTO list firstTokens
    SPLIT secondInput INTO list secondTokens
    
    // Initialize a difference counter
    INITIALIZE differenceCounter AS 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the tokens to integers
        SET firstValue AS INTEGER OF firstTokens[index]
        SET secondValue AS INTEGER OF secondTokens[index]
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCounter
        ENDIF
    END FOR

    // If the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCounter IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF this file is run as the main program THEN
    CALL main()
ENDIF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling:** The function starts by reading two lines of input from the user, representing two sets of values.
2. **String Splitting:** Each input line is split into a list of strings to facilitate processing.
3. **Difference Counting:** A counter is initialized to track how many values differ between the two input lists.
4. **Looping and Comparison:** A loop iterates over the first three elements of each list, converting them to integers and checking for equality.
5. **Result Evaluation:** After counting the differences, the output is determined based on whether the count of differing values is less than 3.
6. **Program Structure:** The structure includes a main function and a conditional to ensure it runs when the script is executed directly. 

This pseudocode provides a clear and logical representation of the original Python code, suitable for readers with varying programming backgrounds.
