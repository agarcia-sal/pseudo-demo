**Purpose:** The code compares two sets of three integers from user input and determines if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read input values
    SET firstInput TO get user input
    SET secondInput TO get user input

    // Split the input strings into separate integer components
    SET firstList TO split firstInput into a list of integers
    SET secondList TO split secondInput into a list of integers

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the three integers
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        SET firstValue TO firstList[index] 
        SET secondValue TO secondList[index] 
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the number of differences is less than three
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL main
``` 

### Explanation:
1. The `main` function gathers two lists of integers from user input.
2. It splits the inputs into individual integers for comparison.
3. It counts how many integers differ between the two lists.
4. Finally, based on the difference count, it prints "YES" if fewer than three integers differ and "NO" if three or more differ.
