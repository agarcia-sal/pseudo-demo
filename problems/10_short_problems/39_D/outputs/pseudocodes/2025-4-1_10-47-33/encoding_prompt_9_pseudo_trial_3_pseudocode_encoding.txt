Certainly! Below is a pseudocode representation of the provided Python code, focusing on clarity and accessibility for readers.

**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three integers and determine how many integers are different. If fewer than three integers differ, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN MAIN FUNCTION

    // Step 1: Read the first set of integers from the user
    PRINT "Enter the first set of three integers:"
    VARIABLE firstSet = READ user input

    // Step 2: Read the second set of integers from the user
    PRINT "Enter the second set of three integers:"
    VARIABLE secondSet = READ user input

    // Step 3: Split the input strings into lists of integers
    VARIABLE firstList = SPLIT firstSet into individual numbers
    VARIABLE secondList = SPLIT secondSet into individual numbers

    // Step 4: Initialize a counter for differences
    VARIABLE differenceCount = 0

    // Step 5: Compare the corresponding integers from both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string to integer for comparison
        VARIABLE firstNumber = CONVERT firstList[index] TO integer
        VARIABLE secondNumber = CONVERT secondList[index] TO integer
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF firstNumber NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // Step 6: Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"

END MAIN FUNCTION
```

**Review:** The pseudocode breaks down the original Python code into simple, high-level actions while retaining the core logic. Each section is labeled clearly to provide context for the operations that are performed, making it accessible to readers without a background in programming.
