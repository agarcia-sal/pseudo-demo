**Pseudocode:**

DEFINE function doMain

    // Read input values
    DECLARE firstInput AS string
    DECLARE secondInput AS string

    firstInput = GET input from user
    secondInput = GET input from user

    // Split the inputs into lists of values
    DECLARE firstList AS list of strings
    DECLARE secondList AS list of strings

    firstList = SPLIT firstInput by space
    secondList = SPLIT secondInput by space

    // Initialize a variable to count differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS integer
    differenceCount = 0

    // Compare corresponding elements of the two lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE firstValue AS integer
        DECLARE secondValue AS integer

        firstValue = CONVERT firstList[index] to integer
        secondValue = CONVERT secondList[index] to integer

        // Count differences
        IF firstValue is NOT EQUAL to secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Output the result based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
IF this script is executed as the main program THEN
    CALL doMain
END IF
