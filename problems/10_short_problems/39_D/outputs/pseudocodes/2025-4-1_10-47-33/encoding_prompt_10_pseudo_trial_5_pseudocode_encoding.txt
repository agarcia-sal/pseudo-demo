Here's the pseudocode translation of the provided Python code, following the guided steps you've outlined:

```
FUNCTION doMain:
    DECLARE variable t1 as STRING
    DECLARE variable t2 as STRING
    DECLARE variable res as INTEGER
    SET res = 0

    OUTPUT "Please enter the first line of numbers:"
    READ t1
    OUTPUT "Please enter the second line of numbers:"
    READ t2

    DECLARE variable tt1 as LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE variable tt2 as LIST OF STRING

    SET tt1 = SPLIT t1 into a list of strings
    SET tt2 = SPLIT t2 into a list of strings

    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        DECLARE variable a as INTEGER
        DECLARE variable b as INTEGER
        SET a = CONVERT tt1[index] to INTEGER
        SET b = CONVERT tt2[index] to INTEGER
        
        IF a is NOT EQUAL TO b THEN:
            INCREMENT res by 1

    IF res is LESS THAN 3 THEN:
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE:
        OUTPUT "NO"

IF this script is executed as the main program THEN:
    CALL doMain()
```

### Assumptions:
1. Input consists of two lines, each containing exactly three space-separated numbers.
2. All inputs are valid and can be converted to integers without errors.
3. The type of `res` is assumed to be INTEGER, and `tt1` and `tt2` are LIST types storing STRING representations of the numbers. 

### Notes on Structured Language Concepts:
- **Declarative Statements:** Declare each variable with a clear type.
- **Loop Control:** Use a `FOR` loop to iterate through a fixed range.
- **Conditional Statements:** Utilize `IF-THEN` structures for decision-making.
- **Input/Output:** Clearly state actions related to user interaction at the start.
- **Meaningful Identifiers:** Use descriptive names for variables and functions to enhance readability.
