### Explanation:

- The pseudocode is organized into functions and clear sections, enabling easy navigation through the logic.
- Key steps in the original code, such as reading inputs and counting differences, are broken down into clear actions.
- Variable names are chosen to reflect their purpose, providing clarity on what data they hold.
- Control structures like loops and conditionals are outlined in plain language, making it easier to understand the flow of logic.
- The output section is explicitly stated, indicating what the final result will be based on the comparison.
