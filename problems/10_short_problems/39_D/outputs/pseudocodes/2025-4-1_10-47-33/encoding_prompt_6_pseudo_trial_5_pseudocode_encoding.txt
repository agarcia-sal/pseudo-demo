Here is the pseudocode that represents the logic of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input, each containing three numbers separated by spaces
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Split the input lines into lists of strings, representing the numbers
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList

    // Initialize a counter for the number of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of each list
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string numbers to integers
        SET numFromFirstList TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET numFromSecondList TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER

        // Check if the numbers at the current index are different
        IF numFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO numFromSecondList THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // If the count of differences is less than 3, print "YES", otherwise print "NO"
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Call the main function to execute the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

- The program begins by defining the main function where it manages the core logic.
- It reads two sets of input, which are expected to contain three numbers each.
- The input strings are split into lists of string numbers.
- A counter `differenceCount` is initialized to zero to keep track of how many numbers differ between the two inputs.
- A loop iterates through the indices of the lists, converting the string representations of numbers into integers.
- During each iteration, it checks if the corresponding numbers are different, and if so, increments the difference counter.
- After completing the checks, the program evaluates the counter; if less than 3 differences were found, it outputs "YES", otherwise it outputs "NO".
  
This structure maintains clarity and abstracted the specifics of the original code while conveying its intended functionality.
