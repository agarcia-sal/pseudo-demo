**Purpose:**  
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and count how many numbers differ between them. Based on the count of differences, it outputs either "YES" (if fewer than three numbers differ) or "NO" (if three or more numbers differ).

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Get input from the user for both sets of numbers
    SET firstInput TO get user input
    SET secondInput TO get user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstSet TO split firstInput into list of strings
    SET secondSet TO split secondInput into list of strings

    // Initialize a counter for the number of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through each position in the sets (there are 3 positions)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2
        // Convert the current elements from strings to integers
        SET firstNumber TO convert firstSet[index] to integer
        SET secondNumber TO convert secondSet[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the numbers at the current position are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT equal to secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // After checking all positions, decide the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Run the Main function
CALL Main
```

**Annotations for Clarity:**

- `get user input` refers to the action of prompting the user to enter data.
- `split string into list of strings` signifies breaking a string into individual components based on spaces.
- `convert to integer` indicates transforming a string representation of a number into an actual integer type.
- `differenceCount` tracks how many numbers in the two sets do not match.
- The condition `IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3` checks to determine if the output should be "YES" (indicating acceptable differences) or "NO" (indicating too many differences).

This pseudocode is structured and clear, making it accessible for readers who may not be familiar with programming languages while effectively conveying the logic and flow of the original code.
