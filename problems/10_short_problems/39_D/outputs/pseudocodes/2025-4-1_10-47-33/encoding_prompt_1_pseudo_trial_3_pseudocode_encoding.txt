**Pseudocode:**

BEGIN MAIN FUNCTION

    // Step 1: Read two lines of input from the user
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = INPUT()
    secondInput = INPUT()

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    DECLARE firstList AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE secondList AS LIST OF STRINGS
    firstList = SPLIT(firstInput)
    secondList = SPLIT(secondInput)

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Step 4: Compare elements from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers for comparison
        DECLARE firstValue AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondValue AS INTEGER
        firstValue = CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        secondValue = CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER

        // Count how many values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END MAIN FUNCTION

// This program thus compares two sets of three values each
// and prints "YES" if there are fewer than three differences, otherwise prints "NO".
