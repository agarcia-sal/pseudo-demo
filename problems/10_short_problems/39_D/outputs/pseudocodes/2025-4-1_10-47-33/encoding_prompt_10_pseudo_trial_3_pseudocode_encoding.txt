Here is the pseudocode based on the provided Python code, following the structured language concepts and the provided steps.

```
FUNCTION doMain:
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO 0
    
    // Input two strings containing numbers
    SET t1 TO USER INPUT
    SET t2 TO USER INPUT
    
    // Split input strings into lists of strings
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 BY SPACE
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 BY SPACE
    
    // Loop to compare the first three elements
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2:
        // Convert string elements to integers and assign to variables
        SET a TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        SET b TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
        
        // Compare the two integers
        IF a NOT EQUAL TO b:
            INCREMENT res BY 1
    
    // Determine the result based on the count of differences
    IF res LESS THAN 3:
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO"

// Entry point for program execution
IF CURRENT_MODULE IS "__main__":
    CALL doMain()
```

### Assumptions:
- The input strings `t1` and `t2` each contain exactly three space-separated integers.
- The integers can be converted from string format without errors.
- The program is designed to run in an environment that supports user input and output display. 

### Explanation of Key Components:
- **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by collecting input values for comparisons.
- **List Splitting:** The `.split()` function is translated to a `SPLIT` operation to create lists for easier manipulation.
- **Loop Structure:** A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through the indices that represent the elements to compare.
- **Conditional Logic:** The `IF` statements are used to compare values and decide the output based on the count of differences.
- **Function Declaration:** A clear separation of functionality is maintained with the `FUNCTION` structure.
- **Output Decision:** Simple output based on a condition is presented in a straightforward manner.
