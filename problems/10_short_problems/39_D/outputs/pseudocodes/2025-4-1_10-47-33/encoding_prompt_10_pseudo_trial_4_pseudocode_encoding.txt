Here's a clear and concise pseudocode representation of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Assume t1 and t2 are strings containing space-separated integers.
    
    // Input two strings
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input
    
    // Split input strings into lists of strings
    SET tt1 TO split t1 by space
    SET tt2 TO split t2 by space
    
    // Initialize a result counter
    SET res TO 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of the lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements of both lists to integers
        SET a TO integer value of tt1[x]
        SET b TO integer value of tt2[x]
        
        // Check if the values from both lists are not equal
        IF a is not equal to b THEN
            // Increment the result counter
            INCREMENT res by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check the total number of different elements
    IF res is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution block
IF this script is executed as the main program THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

### Key Highlights:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode captures the user input for two strings (`t1` and `t2`).
2. **Data Processing**: It clearly separates the actions of splitting the strings and converting them into integers.
3. **Loop Logic**: The loop structure is clearly articulated to show the intent of comparing elements.
4. **Conditionals**: The conditions check and resulting actions are explicitly stated.
5. **Output**: The output reflects the program's results clearly.

### Assumptions:
- The input strings contain space-separated integers.
- The program compares exactly three integers based on the requirements of the original code.
