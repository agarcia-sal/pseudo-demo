**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION MainProcedure
    // Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Split the input lines into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstLine into firstList
    SPLIT secondLine into secondList

    // Initialize a variable to count differences
    Initialize differenceCount to 0

    // Iterate through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current element from each list to an integer
        Set valueFromFirstList to Convert firstList[index] to Integer
        Set valueFromSecondList to Convert secondList[index] to Integer
        
        // Check if the two values are different
        IF valueFromFirstList is NOT EQUAL to valueFromSecondList THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            Increment differenceCount by 1

    // Check the total number of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"

END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF current script is MAIN THEN
    CALL MainProcedure
END IF
``` 

**Explanation:**
- The pseudocode defines a main procedure that reads two lines of input, each containing three values.
- It splits these lines into lists for easier access to individual values.
- It counts how many values differ between the two lists, and if there are fewer than three differences, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
