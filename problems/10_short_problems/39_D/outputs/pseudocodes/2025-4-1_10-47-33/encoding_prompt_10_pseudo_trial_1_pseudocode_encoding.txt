Here is the pseudocode translated from the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION doMain
    // Step 1: Read input strings
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input

    // Step 2: Split input strings into lists
    SET tt1 TO split t1 by whitespace
    SET tt2 TO split t2 by whitespace

    // Step 3: Initialize a variable to count differences
    SET res TO 0

    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of the lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Step 5: Convert string elements to integers
        SET a TO convert tt1[x] to integer
        SET b TO convert tt2[x] to integer
        
        // Step 6: Compare the values and increment difference count if not equal
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Step 7: Check the number of differences and print the result
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Step 8: Execute the main function when the script runs
CALL doMain
```

### Assumptions:
1. The input provided to the program consists of two space-separated strings representing numbers.
2. Each input string contains exactly three elements.
3. The input values can be successfully converted to integers. 

### Explanation of Components:
- **Input Handling:** The program reads two strings from user input.
- **String Splitting:** It splits the input strings into lists to access each number individually.
- **Looping:** A for loop iterates over the first three elements to count how many differ between the two lists.
- **Conditional Statements:** If-else checks determine whether to print "YES" or "NO" based on the count of differences.
- **Function Structure:** Functions are organized clearly, with clearly defined input and output actions.
