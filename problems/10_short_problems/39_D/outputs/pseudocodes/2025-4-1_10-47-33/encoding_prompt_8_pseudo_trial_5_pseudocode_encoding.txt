### Purpose
The main goal of this code is to compare two sets of three integers, determining how many integers differ between the two sets and printing "YES" if fewer than three integers differ, and "NO" otherwise.

### Pseudocode
```
FUNCTION main
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    SET firstInput TO read user input
    SET secondInput TO read user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstList TO split firstInput into a list of substrings
    SET secondList TO split secondInput into a list of substrings
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements from strings to integers
        SET firstNumber TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondNumber TO convert secondList[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the two numbers are different
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber THEN
            // Increment the counter for differences
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        ENDIF
    END FOR
    
    // Check if the total differences are less than three
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"  // Fewer than three differences
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"   // Three or more differences
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Main entry point of the program
IF the script is being run as the main program THEN
    CALL main
ENDIF
```

### Comments for Clarity
- The code starts by accepting two inputs, which are expected to be strings of space-separated integers.
- It splits these strings into lists to facilitate element-wise comparison.
- The loop is set to run three times, reflecting the expectation that there are always three integers to compare.
- The program counts the number of differing integers and determines whether to output "YES" or "NO" based on the count of differences.
