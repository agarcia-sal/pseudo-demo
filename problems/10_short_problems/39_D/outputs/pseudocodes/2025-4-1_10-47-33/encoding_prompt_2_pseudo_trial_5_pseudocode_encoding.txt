**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**
  
2. **Prompt the user for input:**
   - Get the first set of values from the user and store it in a variable called userInput1.
   - Get the second set of values from the user and store it in a variable called userInput2.

3. **Split the input strings into individual components:**
   - Break userInput1 into a list of values called valueList1.
   - Break userInput2 into a list of values called valueList2.

4. **Initialize a counter for differences:**
   - Set a variable named differenceCounter to zero.

5. **Compare the corresponding values from both lists:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the value at the current index of valueList1 to an integer and store it in a variable named valueA.
     - Convert the value at the current index of valueList2 to an integer and store it in a variable named valueB.
     - If valueA is not equal to valueB:
       - Increment the differenceCounter by 1.

6. **Evaluate the total differences:**
   - If differenceCounter is less than 3:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

7. **End the program.**
