Here is a structured pseudocode representation of the provided Python code:

```
BEGIN FUNCTION doMain

    // Read input values for two test cases
    DECLARE firstTestCase AS STRING
    DECLARE secondTestCase AS STRING
    firstTestCase = GET USER INPUT
    secondTestCase = GET USER INPUT
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    DECLARE firstTestList AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE secondTestList AS LIST OF STRING
    firstTestList = SPLIT firstTestCase INTO LIST OF SUBSTRINGS
    secondTestList = SPLIT secondTestCase INTO LIST OF SUBSTRINGS

    // Initialize count of differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0

    // Compare corresponding elements of both test cases
    FOR EACH INDEX FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE valueFromFirstTest AS INTEGER
        DECLARE valueFromSecondTest AS INTEGER
        valueFromFirstTest = CONVERT firstTestList[INDEX] TO INTEGER
        valueFromSecondTest = CONVERT secondTestList[INDEX] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values from both test cases are different
        IF valueFromFirstTest IS NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondTest THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Decide if the number of differences is acceptable
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function if the script is run directly
IF this script is the main program THEN
    CALL doMain
END IF
```

### Clarifications:
1. **Input/Output**: The pseudocode clearly indicates where input values are taken and what output is produced.
2. **Control Structures**: Loops and conditions utilize straightforward language to convey their purpose.
3. **High-Level Logic**: The pseudocode maintains readability and high-level structure suitable for understanding the algorithm's flow without diving into syntax specifics.
