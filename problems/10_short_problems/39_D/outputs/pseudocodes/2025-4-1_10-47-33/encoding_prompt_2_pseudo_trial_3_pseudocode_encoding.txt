**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Define the main function.**
   - **Prompt for user input:**
     - Read the first line of input and store it as `firstInput`.
     - Read the second line of input and store it as `secondInput`.

3. **Process the inputs:**
   - Split `firstInput` into a list of strings called `firstList`.
   - Split `secondInput` into a list of strings called `secondList`.

4. **Initialize a counter:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to zero to keep track of how many elements differ between the two lists.

5. **Compare the elements of both lists:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (total of 3 comparisons):
     - Convert the element in `firstList` at the current index to an integer and store it as `firstValue`.
     - Convert the element in `secondList` at the current index to an integer and store it as `secondValue`.
     - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`, increment `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Decide the result based on the count of differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

7. **End the main function.**

8. **If this file is executed as the main program, call the main function.**

**End of Pseudocode.**
