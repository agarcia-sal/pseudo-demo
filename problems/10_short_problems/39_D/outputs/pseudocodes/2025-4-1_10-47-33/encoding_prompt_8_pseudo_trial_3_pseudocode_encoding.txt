**Purpose**: The program compares two sets of three integer values entered by the user and determines if they are similar based on how many values differ. If fewer than three values are different, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Get the first set of numbers from the user
    SET firstInput TO user input
    // Get the second set of numbers from the user
    SET secondInput TO user input

    // Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SET firstValues TO split firstInput into a list
    SET secondValues TO split secondInput into a list
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the range of the first three values
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2
        // Convert the current string values to integers
        SET firstValue TO convert firstValues[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondValues[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            // If they are different, increase the counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Check the count of differences to decide the output
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        // Less than three differences means they are similar
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Three or more differences means they are not similar
        OUTPUT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL main
```

### Comments for Clarity:
- The program starts by collecting two inputs, each containing three integer values.
- It counts how many of these values differ between the two input sets.
- Depending on the count of differing values, it determines and outputs whether the sets are considered similar or not.
