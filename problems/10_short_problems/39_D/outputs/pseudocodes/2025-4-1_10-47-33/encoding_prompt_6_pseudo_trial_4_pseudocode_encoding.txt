Here is the pseudocode that translates the provided Python code into a clear and understandable format:

```
FUNCTION Main()
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of values
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet
    
    // Split the input lines into lists for comparison
    SPLIT firstSet INTO list firstValues
    SPLIT secondSet INTO list secondValues
    
    // Initialize a variable to count the number of differences
    SET differencesCount TO 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements from strings to integers for comparison
        SET valueFromFirstSet TO CONVERT firstValues[index] TO INTEGER
        SET valueFromSecondSet TO CONVERT secondValues[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // If the values from the two sets are different, increment the count
        IF valueFromFirstSet IS NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondSet THEN
            INCREMENT differencesCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check the total number of differences and print the result
    IF differencesCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL Main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Function Declaration**: The `Main` function encompasses the main operations of the code.
2. **Input Reading**: The input values are read as strings and split into lists for easy access and comparison.
3. **Counting Differences**: A loop iterates through the first three elements of the input lists, counting how many values differ.
4. **Conditional Output**: Based on the number of differences counted, a message ("YES" or "NO") is printed to convey the result.
5. **Execution**: The `Main` function is invoked to run the algorithm.

This pseudocode captures the overall logic and functionality of the original code while ensuring clarity and accessibility for readers unfamiliar with programming.
