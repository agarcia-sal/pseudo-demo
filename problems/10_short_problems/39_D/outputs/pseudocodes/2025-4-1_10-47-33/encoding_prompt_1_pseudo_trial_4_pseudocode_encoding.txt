**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main

    PROMPT user for input and store in variable firstInput
    PROMPT user for input and store in variable secondInput
    
    SPLIT firstInput into a list called firstList
    SPLIT secondInput into a list called secondList
    
    SET differenceCount to 0

    // Compare the elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers for comparison
        SET valueFromFirstList to INTEGER of firstList[index]
        SET valueFromSecondList to INTEGER of secondList[index]

        // Check if the values are different
        IF valueFromFirstList is NOT equal to valueFromSecondList THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Evaluate how many differences were found
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF

END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL main
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode
1. The main function starts by asking the user for two inputs.
2. These inputs are split into lists for comparison.
3. A counter is initialized to keep track of differences between corresponding elements in the lists.
4. A loop runs through the first three indices of the lists, comparing the converted integer values.
5. If a difference is found, the counter is incremented.
6. After the loop, the code checks if there were fewer than three differences and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
