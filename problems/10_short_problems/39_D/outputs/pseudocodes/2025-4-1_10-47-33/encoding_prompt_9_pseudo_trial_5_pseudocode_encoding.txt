**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numbers and determine if they differ in less than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Receive two input strings:**
   - Let `firstSet` be the first input string representing a list of three numbers.
   - Let `secondSet` be the second input string representing a list of three numbers.

3. **Split both input strings into lists:**
   - Create a list called `numbersFirst` by dividing `firstSet` into separate numbers.
   - Create a list called `numbersSecond` by dividing `secondSet` into separate numbers.

4. **Initialize a counter for differences:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0.

5. **Loop through each number in both lists:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the position of the numbers):
     - Convert the number from `numbersFirst` and `numbersSecond` at the current index from string to an integer.
     - If the number from `numbersFirst` is not equal to the number from `numbersSecond`:
       - Increase `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Evaluate the number of differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3: 
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise: 
     - Print "NO".

7. **End of the program.**

This pseudocode clearly captures the logic and flow of the original code while using descriptive names and straightforward language to enhance understanding.
