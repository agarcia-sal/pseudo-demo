Here is the pseudocode derived from the provided Python code, structured for clarity and readability:

```
FUNCTION doMain
    // Read two lines of input
    SET t1 TO input()
    SET t2 TO input()
    
    // Split the two input strings by space into lists
    SET tt1 TO Split(t1)
    SET tt2 TO Split(t2)
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET res TO 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        SET a TO ConvertToInteger(tt1[x])
        SET b TO ConvertToInteger(tt2[x])
        
        // Check if the integers are different
        IF a NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT res
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check the number of differences
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
IF currentScriptIsMain THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

### Explanation of Key Components:
1. **Functions**: The main logic is encapsulated in the `doMain` function.
2. **Input Handling**: It reads two lines of input which are expected to be space-separated values.
3. **Lists and Looping**: The input strings are split into lists, and a loop iterates through the first three elements of both lists.
4. **Conditionals**: It checks for differences between the two corresponding integers and counts them.
5. **Output**: The result is determined based on the count of differences and printed accordingly.
  
### Assumptions:
- The inputs consist of valid space-separated integers.
- The code always receives at least three integers in each input, as the loop iterates up to index 2 (representing three elements).
- The function to convert strings to integers and the string splitting operation are assumed to exist (`ConvertToInteger` and `Split` are placeholder functions for this purpose).
