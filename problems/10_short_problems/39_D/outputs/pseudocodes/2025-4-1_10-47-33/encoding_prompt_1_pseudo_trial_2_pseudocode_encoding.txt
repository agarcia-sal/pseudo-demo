**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read input values from the user
    userInput1 = GET user input
    userInput2 = GET user input
    
    // Split the input strings into list of strings
    list1 = SPLIT userInput1 into a list
    list2 = SPLIT userInput2 into a list
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    differenceCount = 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert current elements to integers
        valueFromList1 = CONVERT list1[index] to integer
        valueFromList2 = CONVERT list2[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF valueFromList1 IS NOT EQUAL TO valueFromList2 THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Evaluate the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL main()
```

This pseudocode represents the algorithm's intent clearly by indicating the purpose of each step, using descriptive names and summarizing control structures in plain language. The algorithm compares two sets of values, counts the differences, and outputs a result based on that count.
