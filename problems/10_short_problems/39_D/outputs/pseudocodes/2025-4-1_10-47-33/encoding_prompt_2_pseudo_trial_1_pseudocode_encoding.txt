**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
2. **Define Main Function**
   
   1. **Receive Input**
      - Read a string from the user, which will represent the first list of values (store in a variable named firstList).
      - Read a second string from the user, which will represent the second list of values (store in a variable named secondList).

   2. **Split Input into Lists**
      - Divide firstList into separate elements based on spaces and store these elements in a variable named firstElements.
      - Divide secondList into separate elements based on spaces and store these elements in a variable named secondElements.

   3. **Initialize a Counter**
      - Create a variable named differenceCount and set its value to zero.

   4. **Compare Corresponding Elements**
      - For each index (from 0 to 2):
        - Retrieve the first element from firstElements at the current index and convert it to an integer (store in variable currentFirstValue).
        - Retrieve the second element from secondElements at the current index and convert it to an integer (store in variable currentSecondValue).
        - If currentFirstValue is not equal to currentSecondValue:
          - Increase differenceCount by one.

   5. **Check Number of Differences**
      - If differenceCount is less than 3:
        - Output "YES".
      - Otherwise:
        - Output "NO".

3. **Invoke Main Function to Begin Execution**
4. **End Program**
