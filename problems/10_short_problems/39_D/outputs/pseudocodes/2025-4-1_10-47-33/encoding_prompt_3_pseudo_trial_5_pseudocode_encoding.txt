### Explanation:
- The `doMain` function carries out the core logic of the program: it reads user inputs, counts how many values differ between two sets of inputs, and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the count of differences.
- The pseudocode uses meaningful variable names and simple control structures, making it accessible for someone unfamiliar with programming syntax.
- It clearly indicates inputs (user input strings) and outputs (the response "YES" or "NO"), ensuring the reader understands the purpose of the function and its flow.
