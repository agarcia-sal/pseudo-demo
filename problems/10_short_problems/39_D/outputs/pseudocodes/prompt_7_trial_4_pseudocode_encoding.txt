```pseudocode
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Read two input strings from the user
    SET firstInput TO user input
    SET secondInput TO user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstInputList TO split firstInput into words
    SET secondInputList TO split secondInput into words

    // Initialize a variable to count differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert current elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO convert firstInputList[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondInputList[index] to integer
        
        // Compare the two values
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference count if the values are different
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the number of differences and print the result
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
CALL doMain()
```

### Explanation of Complexity:
The code compares two strings of numbers provided by the user, counts how many of the first three corresponding numbers differ, and outputs "YES" if fewer than three differences exist, and "NO" otherwise. The loop iterates exactly three times, making the logic straightforward and efficient.
