**Pseudocode:**

1. Define a main function named "doMain".
   
2. Prompt the user for the first input string and store it as "firstInputString".
  
3. Prompt the user for the second input string and store it as "secondInputString".

4. Split "firstInputString" into a list of strings called "firstInputList".

5. Split "secondInputString" into a list of strings called "secondInputList".

6. Initialize a variable "differenceCount" to zero. This will track how many elements differ between the two input lists.

7. Loop through the first three elements of both "firstInputList" and "secondInputList":
    a. Convert each corresponding element from "firstInputList" and "secondInputList" to an integer and store them as "firstValue" and "secondValue".
    b. If "firstValue" is not equal to "secondValue":
        - Increment "differenceCount" by 1.

8. After the loop, check if "differenceCount" is less than 3:
    - If it is, print "YES".
    - If it is not, print "NO".

9. If this script is executed as the main program, call the "doMain" function to start the process. 

**Input Requirements:**
- Two lines of input where each line contains three space-separated numbers.

**Output Requirements:**
- Print "YES" if less than three numbers are different between the two inputs, otherwise print "NO".
