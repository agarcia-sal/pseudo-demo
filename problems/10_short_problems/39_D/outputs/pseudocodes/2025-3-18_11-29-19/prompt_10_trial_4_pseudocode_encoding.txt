Here is a clear and concise pseudocode translation of the provided Python code, following the guided steps:

```plaintext
FUNCTION doMain
    // Step 1: Input Prompt
    PROMPT user for the first string input, assign to t1
    PROMPT user for the second string input, assign to t2

    // Step 2: Split Inputs
    SPLIT string t1 into a list tt1
    SPLIT string t2 into a list tt2

    // Step 3: Initialize result counter
    SET variable res to 0

    // Step 4: Iterate through the first three elements
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string to integer
        SET variable a to INTEGER value of tt1[index]
        SET variable b to INTEGER value of tt2[index]

        // Check for inequality
        IF a is NOT equal to b THEN
            INCREMENT res by 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Determine the result based on the counter
    IF res is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
CALL doMain
```

### Assumptions:
1. **Data Types**: The input strings represent integers and are expected to contain at least three elements when split.
2. **Input Validity**: It is assumed that the user inputs valid strings that can be split into three parts.

### Key Components Highlighted:
- **Input**: User inputs two strings.
- **Processing**: Splitting inputs, converting to integers, iterating through indices, and counting mismatches.
- **Conditional Logic**: Evaluates if there are less than three mismatches and prints the corresponding result.
