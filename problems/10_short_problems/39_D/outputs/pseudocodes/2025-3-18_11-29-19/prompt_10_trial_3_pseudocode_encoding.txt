**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain
    // Step 1: Get input from the user
    SET t1 TO user input string
    SET t2 TO user input string

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET tt1 TO split t1 by spaces
    SET tt2 TO split t2 by spaces

    // Step 3: Initialize a variable to count differences
    SET res TO 0 

    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Step 5: Convert elements to integers
        SET a TO integer value of tt1[x]
        SET b TO integer value of tt2[x]

        // Step 6: Check for differences
        IF a is NOT equal to b THEN
            INCREMENT res by 1 

    // Step 7: Determine output based on the number of differences
    IF res is LESS than 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
END FUNCTION

// Main execution block
IF this script is run as the main program THEN
    CALL doMain
END IF
```

### Assumptions:
- The input strings `t1` and `t2` contain three space-separated integers.
- The split operation produces non-empty strings that can be converted to integers.
- The counting of differences is based on comparing corresponding elements of the two lists formed from the input strings.
