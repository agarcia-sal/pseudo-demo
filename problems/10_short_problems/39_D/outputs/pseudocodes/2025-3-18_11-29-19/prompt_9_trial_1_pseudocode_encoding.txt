### Purpose
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three integer values input by the user and determine if they differ in less than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three positions, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
Define function main
    Receive input for the first set of values and assign it to firstValueSet
    Receive input for the second set of values and assign it to secondValueSet
    
    Split firstValueSet into a list of values and assign to firstValues
    Split secondValueSet into a list of values and assign to secondValues
    
    Initialize a counter for differences called differenceCount and set it to 0
    
    For each index from 0 to 2 (for three values):
        Convert the value at the current index in firstValues to an integer and assign it to firstNumber
        Convert the value at the current index in secondValues to an integer and assign it to secondNumber
        
        If firstNumber is not equal to secondNumber:
            Increment differenceCount by 1
            
    If differenceCount is less than 3:
        Output "YES"
    Else:
        Output "NO"

If this script is the main program being executed:
    Call the main function
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes two lines of input from the user, each corresponding to a set of three integers.
2. **String Processing**: It splits each line into a list of string values, which are then prepared for comparison.
3. **Counting Differences**: The program initializes a counter to track how many positions differ between the two sets.
4. **Comparison Loop**: A loop iterates through the integers, compares corresponding values, and updates the counter when they do not match.
5. **Output Decision**: Finally, based on the count of differences, the program outputs either "YES" or "NO". 

This pseudocode retains the core logic of the original code while making it accessible and easy to understand for those unfamiliar with programming syntax.
