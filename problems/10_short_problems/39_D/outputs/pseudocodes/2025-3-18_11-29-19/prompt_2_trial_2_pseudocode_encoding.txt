**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Read input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first line of numbers and store it as "firstLine".
   - Prompt the user to enter the second line of numbers and store it as "secondLine".

3. **Split the input:**
   - Split "firstLine" into a list of strings called "firstList".
   - Split "secondLine" into a list of strings called "secondList".

4. **Initialize a variable:**
   - Set a counter variable named "differenceCount" to 0.

5. **Compare elements:**
   - For each position from 0 to 2 (which corresponds to the first three elements in both lists):
     - Convert the value from "firstList" at the current position to an integer and store it as "firstValue".
     - Convert the value from "secondList" at the same position to an integer and store it as "secondValue".
     - If "firstValue" is not equal to "secondValue":
       - Increase "differenceCount" by 1.

6. **Evaluate the result:**
   - If "differenceCount" is less than 3:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

7. **End the program.**
