Here's a structured pseudocode representation of the provided code snippet:

```
Function MAIN
    // Get input from the user for two sets of values
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstList TO split firstSet into individual elements
    SET secondList TO split secondSet into individual elements
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Compare the corresponding elements from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the elements to integers for comparison
        SET valueFromFirstList TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET valueFromSecondList TO convert secondList[index] to integer
        
        // If the values are different, increment the difference counter
        IF valueFromFirstList NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondList THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check if the count of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
IF this script is executed as the main program THEN
    CALL MAIN
END IF
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Declaration**: The pseudocode begins with a function named `MAIN` which encapsulates the entire logic.
2. **Input Handling**: Inputs for two sets are captured from the user clearly in descriptive terms.
3. **Processing Input**: It clearly describes the idea of splitting and converting the string inputs into lists of integers.
4. **Loop and Conditional Logic**: The pseudocode maintains the loop for comparing elements and conditionals for counting differences, using natural language to maintain clarity.
5. **Output**: The final output section is logically separated and articulates the condition being checked.

This structure keeps the focus on what the program is achieving rather than on the code syntax, making it accessible to those unfamiliar with the programming language used in the initial implementation.
