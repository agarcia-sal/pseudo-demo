**Purpose**: The purpose of this program is to compare two sets of three input values (numbers) and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three positions, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION Main:
    // Read two lines of input containing space-separated numbers
    INPUT firstSet FROM user
    INPUT secondSet FROM user
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SPLIT firstSet INTO list firstValues
    SPLIT secondSet INTO list secondValues
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through each position in the lists of numbers
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2: // Only three comparisons
        // Convert the string values to integers
        SET firstNumber TO integer value of firstValues[index]
        SET secondNumber TO integer value of secondValues[index]
        
        // Check if the numbers at the current position are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 // Increase the count of differences
            
    // After comparing all three positions, check the count of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // Output if there are fewer than three differences
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO" // Output if there are three or more differences
        
// Execute the main function
CALL Main
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The program reads two sets of three numbers each from user input.
- It counts how many of the numbers are different between the two sets.
- Based on this count, it decides whether to print "YES" or "NO".
