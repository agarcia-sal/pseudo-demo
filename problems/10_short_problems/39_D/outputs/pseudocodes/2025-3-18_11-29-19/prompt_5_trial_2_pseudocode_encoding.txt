### Purpose
The goal of this code is to compare two sets of three numbers and determine if they differ by less than three values. If they do, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION PerformComparison()
    // Accept two sets of numbers as input
    SET firstInput TO USER_INPUT()  // Get the first set of numbers from the user
    SET secondInput TO USER_INPUT() // Get the second set of numbers from the user

    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstSet TO SplitString(firstInput) // Convert the first input string into a list of numbers
    SET secondSet TO SplitString(secondInput) // Convert the second input string into a list of numbers

    // Initialize a counter for the differences
    SET differenceCounter TO 0 

    // Iterate through each number in the sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string numbers to integers
        SET firstNumber TO ConvertToInteger(firstSet[index]) // Get the number from the first set
        SET secondNumber TO ConvertToInteger(secondSet[index]) // Get the number from the second set
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCounter BY 1 // Increase the difference counter if they are not the same
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the total number of differences
    IF differenceCounter IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // Output YES if less than three differences found
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"  // Output NO if three or more differences found
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF PROGRAM_IS_RUN_DIRECTLY THEN
    CALL PerformComparison() // Execute the comparison function
END IF
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode Structure
- Functions are clearly defined with descriptive names, enhancing understanding.
- Input and output operations are explicitly stated.
- Logical comparisons and counting differences are simplified and made easy to understand.
- Control structures (loops and conditionals) are clearly articulated to reflect the sequence of operations.
- Comments throughout the pseudocode clarify logic and operations for better comprehension.
