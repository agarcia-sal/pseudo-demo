Hereâ€™s a structured pseudocode that translates the provided Python code into a clear and understandable format:

```
Function Main()
    // Read input values
    Read firstInput
    Read secondInput
    
    // Split input strings into lists of strings
    Split firstInput into firstList
    Split secondInput into secondList
    
    // Initialize a mismatch counter
    Initialize mismatchCount to 0 
    
    // Compare each corresponding value in the two lists
    For each index from 0 to 2 do
        // Convert string values to integers
        Set firstValue to convert firstList[index] to integer
        Set secondValue to convert secondList[index] to integer
        
        // Check for mismatch
        If firstValue is not equal to secondValue then
            Increment mismatchCount by 1
    
    // Determine if the number of mismatches is less than 3
    If mismatchCount is less than 3 then
        Print "YES"
    Else
        Print "NO"

// Execute the main function
Call Main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Function Declaration**: Defines the main function where the process begins.
2. **Input Handling**: Clearly indicates the reading of user inputs, with the expectation that each input is a space-separated string of values.
3. **Data Preparation**: Shows the conversion of these input strings into lists for comparison.
4. **Logic Description**: Illustrates the loop for comparing the corresponding elements of both lists and counting mismatches.
5. **Decision Making**: Specifies the logic for determining the output based on how many elements were found to be mismatched.
6. **Output**: States the printed results based on the comparison outcome.

This pseudocode effectively communicates the logic of the original Python code without relying on specific programming language syntax.
