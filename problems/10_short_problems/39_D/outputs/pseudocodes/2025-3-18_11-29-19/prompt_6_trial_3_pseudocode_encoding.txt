**Pseudocode for Comparison Algorithm**

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Read two lines of input
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = GET user input
    secondInput = GET user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    DECLARE firstList AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE secondList AS LIST OF STRINGS
    firstList = SPLIT firstInput into a list of substrings
    secondList = SPLIT secondInput into a list of substrings
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0

    // Iterate over the first three elements of both lists 
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert elements to integers for comparison
        DECLARE elementFromFirstList AS INTEGER
        DECLARE elementFromSecondList AS INTEGER
        elementFromFirstList = CONVERT firstList[index] to INTEGER
        elementFromSecondList = CONVERT secondList[index] to INTEGER

        // Check if the elements are different
        IF elementFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO elementFromSecondList THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF this script is executed as main THEN
    CALL Main
END IF
```

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by reading two input lines and splitting them into lists of substrings.
  
2. **Comparison Loop**: A loop runs for the first three elements from both lists, converting each pair of elements to integers and checking for discrepancies.

3. **Difference Counting**: A counter keeps track of how many pairs of elements differ and increments whenever a difference is found.

4. **Result Decision**: Based on the total discrepancies counted, the program prints "YES" if fewer than three differences are found; otherwise, it prints "NO".

This structure clearly outlines the logic and flow of the original code, making it accessible for anyone to understand the algorithm's purpose and function.
