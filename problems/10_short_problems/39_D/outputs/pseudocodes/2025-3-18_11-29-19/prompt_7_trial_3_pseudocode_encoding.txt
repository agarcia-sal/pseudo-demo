Here's the high-level pseudocode that accurately describes the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two input strings from the user
    INPUT firstString
    INPUT secondString

    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    SPLIT firstString INTO firstTuple
    SPLIT secondString INTO secondTuple
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of the lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO INTEGER OF firstTuple[index]
        SET secondValue TO INTEGER OF secondTuple[index]

        // Check if the current elements are different
        IF firstValue NOT EQUAL secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference count
            INCREMENT differenceCount
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the number of differences and print the result
    IF differenceCount LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Call the main function to execute the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of Complexity:
- The code primarily compares two sets of three integer values entered by the user and counts how many values differ. If fewer than three values differ, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". The loop structure and conditional logic are clearly outlined, allowing for easy understanding of the flow and purpose of the function.
