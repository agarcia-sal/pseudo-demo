Here's the pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided Python code snippet:

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Get two sets of inputs from the user
    INPUT firstTimeString
    INPUT secondTimeString

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstTimeList = Split firstTimeString into a list
    SET secondTimeList = Split secondTimeString into a list

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount = 0 

    // Iterate over the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the corresponding elements to integers
        SET firstTimeValue = Convert firstTimeList[index] to integer
        SET secondTimeValue = Convert secondTimeList[index] to integer

        // Compare the two values and count differences
        IF firstTimeValue is NOT EQUAL to secondTimeValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR 

    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE 
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the Main function if this script is run directly
IF this script is the main program THEN
    CALL Main
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Inputs:** The pseudocode clearly defines the inputs as two strings that will be read from the user.
2. **Processing:** It describes the steps to split these strings into lists, iterate through their elements, and compare them for differences.
3. **Control Structures:** The loops and conditionals are laid out in a straightforward manner to enhance understanding.
4. **Outputs:** The pseudocode indicates the output based on the comparison.
5. **Structure:** Proper indentation and sectioning are used to maintain readability and clarity. 

Overall, this pseudocode aims to provide a clear understanding of what the original code is doing without focusing on specific programming syntax.
