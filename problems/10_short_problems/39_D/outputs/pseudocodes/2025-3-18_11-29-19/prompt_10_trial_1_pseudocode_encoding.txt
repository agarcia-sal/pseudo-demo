Here is the clear and concise pseudocode based on the provided Python code:

```
Function doMain
    // Step 1: Read input values
    Set t1 to user input
    Set t2 to user input

    // Step 2: Split input strings into lists
    Set tt1 to split t1 into list of strings
    Set tt2 to split t2 into list of strings

    // Step 3: Initialize result counter
    Set res to 0 

    // Step 4: Compare elements from the two lists
    For index from 0 to 2 do
        Set a to integer value of tt1[index]
        Set b to integer value of tt2[index]
        
        // Step 5: Increment result counter if values are different
        If a is not equal to b then
            Increment res by 1

    // Step 6: Determine and print result
    If res is less than 3 then
        Print "YES"
    Else
        Print "NO"
End Function

// Step 7: Main execution
If this is the main program then
    Call doMain
End If
```

### Assumptions:
1. The user inputs are valid strings that can be split by spaces.
2. The split strings can be converted into integers and have exactly three components.
3. The program is designed to compare lists of exactly three numbers.
