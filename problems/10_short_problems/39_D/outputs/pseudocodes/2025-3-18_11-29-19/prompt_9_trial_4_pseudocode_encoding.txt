**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine how many of them are different. If fewer than three inputs differ, a message indicating "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Gather input
    PROMPT user for first set of numbers (string of space-separated values) 
    READ first set of numbers into variable firstNumbers
    PROMPT user for second set of numbers (string of space-separated values)
    READ second set of numbers into variable secondNumbers

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SPLIT firstNumbers into a list called firstList
    SPLIT secondNumbers into a list called secondList

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount to 0 

    // Step 4: Compare corresponding numbers in both lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        // Convert the values to integers for comparison
        SET numA to convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET numB to convert secondList[index] to integer

        // Step 5: Check if the numbers are different
        IF numA is NOT equal to numB THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // Step 6: Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"

END
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Components:**

1. **Input Gathering:** The pseudocode starts with prompts for the user to provide two sets of inputs, which are read into separate variables.
   
2. **Data Handling:** The two input strings are split into lists, allowing each individual number to be processed in subsequent steps.

3. **Difference Counting:** A loop iterates through the first three elements of both lists. The numbers are compared, and a counter tracks how many are different.

4. **Conditional Output:** After counting the differences, a simple condition checks if the count is less than three, deciding which message to print.

This format ensures clarity and process understanding without being hindered by specific programming syntax, making it accessible for readers of various knowledge levels.
