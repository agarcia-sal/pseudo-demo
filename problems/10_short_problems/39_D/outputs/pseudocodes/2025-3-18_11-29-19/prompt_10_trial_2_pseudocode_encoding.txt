Here's the pseudocode that translates the given Python code into a clear and concise structured format:

```
FUNCTION doMain
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER INITIALIZE TO 0
    
    // Read input values
    t1 = GET user input
    t2 = GET user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists
    tt1 = SPLIT t1 by spaces
    tt2 = SPLIT t2 by spaces
    
    // Compare the elements of the lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER CONVERT(tt1[x])
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER CONVERT(tt2[x])
        
        // Increment result if elements differ
        IF a NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            res = res + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine the result based on the comparison count
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main program execution
CALL doMain
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **FUNCTION doMain**: Defines a main function where the logic is encapsulated.
2. **Declare Variables**: Clearly indicates the data types and initializes variables.
3. **Input Handling**: Uses a high-level way of getting user input and split strings into lists.
4. **Comparison Loop**: Iterates over the elements of the lists, converting strings to integers and counting differences.
5. **Conditional Logic**: Implements a straightforward conditional check to assess the output based on the count of differences.
6. **Main Program Call**: Indicates the invocation of the main function in the execution phase. 

### Assumptions:
- User inputs two space-separated strings of numbers corresponding to three values each.
- Input values are convertible to integers without errors.
