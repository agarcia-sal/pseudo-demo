### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The main logic is encapsulated in a function called `doMain`.
2. **Input Reading**: It reads two lines of input, which are expected to be strings representing numbers.
3. **Splitting Strings**: Each input line is split into lists of strings based on whitespace.
4. **Difference Counter**: A counter is initialized to track how many corresponding numbers from the two input lists differ.
5. **Looping Through Elements**: A loop runs three times (from 0 to 2), checking corresponding numbers from both lists.
6. **Counting Differences**: If corresponding numbers differ, the counter is incremented.
7. **Decision Making**: Finally, it checks if the count of differing values is less than 3 and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly. 

This pseudocode captures the logic of the original code while ensuring it is understandable and avoids technical jargon.
