**Purpose:**  
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three integers and determine if they are different in no more than two positions. If they are, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Main Program**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
    - Read the first set of numbers from user input and store it in a variable called `firstSet`.
    - Read the second set of numbers from user input and store it in a variable called `secondSet`.

3. **Split Input Strings into Lists:**
    - Convert `firstSet` into a list of strings called `firstList` by splitting it using spaces.
    - Convert `secondSet` into a list of strings called `secondList` by splitting it using spaces.

4. **Initialize Difference Counter:**
    - Create a variable `differenceCount` and set it to zero. This will track how many positions have different values.

5. **Compare Each Position:**
    - For each index from 0 to 2 (which represents the three positions):
        a. Convert the value at the current index in `firstList` to an integer and store it in a variable called `firstValue`.
        b. Convert the value at the current index in `secondList` to an integer and store it in a variable called `secondValue`.
        c. If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`, increase `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Determine Result:**
    - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
        - Output "YES".
    - Otherwise:
        - Output "NO".
   
7. **End Main Program**

**Notes:**
- The code assumes that both input lines always contain exactly three space-separated integers.
- The output provides a simple affirmation or negation based on the comparison of the input sets at corresponding positions.
