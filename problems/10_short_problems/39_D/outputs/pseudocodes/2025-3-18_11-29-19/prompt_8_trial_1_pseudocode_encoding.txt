**Purpose**: The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical values entered by the user and determine if they differ in less than three positions. If they do, the output is "YES", otherwise it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Get input from the user
    PROMPT the user for the first set of numbers
    STORE the first set of numbers in a variable called firstSet
    
    PROMPT the user for the second set of numbers
    STORE the second set of numbers in a variable called secondSet

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into individual numbers
    SPLIT firstSet into individual numbers and store them in a list called numberList1
    SPLIT secondSet into individual numbers and store them in a list called numberList2

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differencesCount to 0

    // Step 4: Compare the corresponding numbers in both lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 (representing three comparisons)
        // Convert the values to integers for comparison
        SET value1 to the number from numberList1 at the current index
        SET value2 to the number from numberList2 at the current index
        
        // Step 5: Check if the numbers are different
        IF value1 is NOT equal to value2 THEN
            INCREMENT differencesCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Determine the result based on the count of differences
    IF differencesCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function when the program starts
CALL main
```

**Comments**:
- The program compares only three numbers from two different sets, so it uses a fixed loop that iterates exactly three times.
- The primary logic involves counting the number of differing values and checking if this count is less than three to determine the output.
- The use of lists allows for easy access to individual numbers based on their positions.
