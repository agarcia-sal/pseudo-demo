**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the process.**

2. **Receive input:**
   - Get the first line of input and store it in variable `firstInput`.
   - Get the second line of input and store it in variable `secondInput`.

3. **Split the inputs into lists:**
   - Create a list `firstList` by dividing `firstInput` into individual elements based on spaces.
   - Create a list `secondList` by dividing `secondInput` into individual elements based on spaces.

4. **Initialize a counter for differences:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to zero to keep track of the number of differing elements.

5. **Loop through the first three elements:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2:
     - Convert the element from `firstList` at the current index into an integer and store it in variable `firstValue`.
     - Convert the element from `secondList` at the same index into an integer and store it in variable `secondValue`.
     - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`, increase the `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Check results:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

7. **End the process.**
