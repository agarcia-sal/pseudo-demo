**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList

    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of the lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER

        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increase the difference count
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Check the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE 
        OUTPUT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Call the main function to execute the program
CALL main()
```

**Explanation:**

1. The pseudocode begins by defining a main function that encapsulates the logic of the program.
2. It reads two lines of input and splits each line into a list of string components.
3. A counter (`differenceCount`) is initialized to track the number of differing elements between the two lists.
4. A loop iterates through the first three elements of these lists, converting each element to an integer and comparing them.
5. If the integers differ, the counter is incremented.
6. After the loop, the pseudocode checks if the count of differing elements is less than 3, outputting "YES" or "NO" based on the condition.
7. Finally, it calls the main function to execute the logic.
