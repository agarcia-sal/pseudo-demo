**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to compare two sets of three integer values and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three positions, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Main Function**
   
   1.1 **Read Input:**
       - Read the first line of input and store it as the first list of numbers.
       - Read the second line of input and store it as the second list of numbers.
   
   1.2 **Split Input Strings into Lists:**
       - Split the first list of numbers into individual elements.
       - Split the second list of numbers into individual elements.
   
   1.3 **Initialize Difference Counter:**
       - Set a counter for differences to zero.

   1.4 **Compare Elements:**
       - For each position from 0 to 2 (for three numbers):
           - Convert the current element of the first list to an integer.
           - Convert the current element of the second list to an integer.
           - If the integers from the two lists at the current position are not equal:
               - Increment the difference counter by one.

   1.5 **Determine Result:**
       - If the difference counter is less than 3:
           - Output "YES".
       - Otherwise:
           - Output "NO".
   
2. **End Main Function**

**Input and Output:**
- **Input:** Two lines of integers (each containing three integers).
- **Output:** A single line stating "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison of the input integers.

**Note on Logical Flow:** 
- The algorithm effectively counts the number of positions where the two lists differ and determines the final output based on that count. It uses basic control structures such as loops and conditionals, maintaining clarity and conciseness throughout.
