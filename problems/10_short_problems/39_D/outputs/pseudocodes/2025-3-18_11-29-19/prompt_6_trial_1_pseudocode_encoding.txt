Here's the pseudocode representation of the provided code, focusing on clarity and understanding:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    SET firstInput TO user input
    SET secondInput TO user input

    // Split the input lines into individual strings
    SET firstInputParts TO split firstInput into a list
    SET secondInputParts TO split secondInput into a list
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of both input lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO integer value of firstInputParts[index]
        SET secondValue TO integer value of secondInputParts[index]

        // Check if the values at the current index are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the count of differences
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check how many differences were counted
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program by calling the main function
CALL main()
```

### Summary of Pseudocode Logic:
1. The program begins by reading two lines of input, which are expected to contain three numerical values each.
2. It splits the inputs into separate components.
3. It initializes a counter to track how many values differ between the two inputs.
4. It iterates through the first three components of each input, comparing corresponding values. Each time a difference is found, it increments the counter.
5. After the comparisons, if fewer than three differences are found, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
