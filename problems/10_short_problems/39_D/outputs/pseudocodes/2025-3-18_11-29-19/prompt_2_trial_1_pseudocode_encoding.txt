**Pseudocode for the Provided Code:**

1. **Start the Program**

2. **Define the Main Function**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first string of numbers, and store it as `firstInput`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second string of numbers, and store it as `secondInput`.
   - Split `firstInput` into individual elements and store them in a list named `firstList`.
   - Split `secondInput` into individual elements and store them in a list named `secondList`.
   - Initialize a variable `differenceCount` to 0. This will keep track of the number of differing elements between the two lists.

3. **Iterate Over the First Three Elements of Both Lists**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the first three positions):
     - Convert the value at the current index in `firstList` into an integer and store it as `firstValue`.
     - Convert the value at the current index in `secondList` into an integer and store it as `secondValue`.
     - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1.

4. **Evaluate the Count of Differences**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Display the message "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Display the message "NO".

5. **Execute the Main Function when the Program Starts**

6. **End the Program**
