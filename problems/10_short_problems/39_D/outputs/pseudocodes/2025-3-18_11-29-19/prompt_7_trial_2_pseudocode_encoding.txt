Here's the pseudocode that summarizes and translates the provided Python code into a high-level, understandable format:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input from the user.
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput
    
    // Split each input line into a list of string elements.
    SET firstList TO FIRST_INPUT.split()
    SET secondList TO SECOND_INPUT.split()
    
    // Initialize a variable to count differences.
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of each list.
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string elements to integers.
        SET firstValue TO INTEGER(firstList[index])
        SET secondValue TO INTEGER(secondList[index])
        
        // Check if the values at the current index are different.
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference count.
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3.
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // Print "YES" if differences are less than 3.
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Print "NO" if differences are equal to or greater than 3.
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program execution.
IF CURRENT_MODULE_IS_MAIN THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Purpose:** The code checks two sets of three integer inputs to see how many differ. If fewer than 3 integers differ, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

2. **Input and Output:** 
   - **Input:** Two lines of input, each containing three space-separated integers.
   - **Output:** A string "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison of inputs.

3. **Control Structures:** 
   - A loop iterates over a fixed range (0 to 2) to compare the input integers.
   - An if-statement checks for differences in the integer values and another if-statement determines the final output.

This pseudocode effectively captures the intent and flow of the original Python program, using clear language to describe each step.
