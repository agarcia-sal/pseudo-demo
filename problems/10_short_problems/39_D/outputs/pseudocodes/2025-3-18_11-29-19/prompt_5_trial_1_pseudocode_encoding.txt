### Purpose
The goal of this code is to compare two sets of three integer values and determine if they are similar enough based on how many values differ. If fewer than three integers are different, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
Function Main:
    // Prompt the user for the first set of values
    Display "Enter first set of values:"
    Read firstSetInput from user
    
    // Prompt the user for the second set of values
    Display "Enter second set of values:"
    Read secondSetInput from user

    // Split the input strings into separate integer values
    Convert firstSetInput into a list of integers called firstSet
    Convert secondSetInput into a list of integers called secondSet

    // Initialize a counter for the number of differing values
    Set differenceCount to 0 

    // Loop through the indices of both sets
    For each index from 0 to 2:
        // Compare the corresponding values in both sets
        Set valueFromFirstSet to firstSet[index]
        Set valueFromSecondSet to secondSet[index]
        
        // If the values are different, increase the count of differences
        If valueFromFirstSet is not equal to valueFromSecondSet:
            Increase differenceCount by 1

    // Check the number of differences counted
    If differenceCount is less than 3:
        // If fewer than 3 differences, print "YES"
        Display "YES"
    Else:
        // If 3 or more differences, print "NO"
        Display "NO"

// Execution starts here
Call Main
```

### Breakdown of Operations
1. **User Input:** The program asks for two sets of three integer values from the user.
2. **Splitting Input:** It processes the input into lists of integers for easy comparison.
3. **Counting Differences:** It uses a loop to compare each corresponding value from both lists and counts how many values differ.
4. **Final Decision:** Based on the count of differences, it prints "YES" if there are fewer than three differences, otherwise it prints "NO". 

### Comments
- Each section and operation includes comments to clarify the logic and steps, making it easier for a reader to follow the flow of the algorithm without needing prior knowledge of programming syntax.
