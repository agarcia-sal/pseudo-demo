Here's the pseudocode that translates the provided Python code into a clear and understandable format:

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Read two input strings from the user
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = Get user input
    secondInput = Get user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    DECLARE firstList AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE secondList AS LIST OF STRING
    firstList = Split firstInput by spaces
    secondList = Split secondInput by spaces

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of each list
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current string elements to integers 
        DECLARE firstValue AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondValue AS INTEGER
        firstValue = Convert firstList[index] to INTEGER
        secondValue = Convert secondList[index] to INTEGER

        // Compare the values and increment the difference counter if they are not equal
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 
        END IF 
    END FOR

    // Check the count of differences to determine the output
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL Main
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

- **Function Definition**: The main logic is wrapped in a function called `Main`.
- **Input Handling**: The function begins by taking two input strings.
- **List Creation**: It splits these strings into lists based on spaces.
- **Initialization**: A counter is initialized to keep track of the number of differences.
- **Looping**: A loop iterates through the first three elements (indices 0 to 2) of both lists.
- **Comparison**: Inside the loop, each pair of corresponding values from the two lists is compared. If they differ, the counter is incremented.
- **Conditional Output**: Finally, it checks the value of the counter. If there are fewer than three differences, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
- **Program Start**: Finally, the function is invoked to run the program. 

This pseudocode captures the logic without getting bogged down in the specifics of syntax, making it easier to understand for someone unfamiliar with programming.
