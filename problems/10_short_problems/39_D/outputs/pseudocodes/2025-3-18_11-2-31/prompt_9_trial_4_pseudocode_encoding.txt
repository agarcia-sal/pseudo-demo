**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical values and determine if they differ by at least one value. If they do, it indicates a potential match; otherwise, it signals that the sets are different.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Receive Input Values:**
   - Prompt the user to input the first set of three numbers (string format).
   - Prompt the user to input the second set of three numbers (string format).

3. **Split Input Strings into Lists:**
   - Convert each input string into a list of numbers by splitting the string based on spaces.

4. **Initialize a Counter for Differences:**
   - Set a variable to count the number of differing values between the two sets. Initialize this counter to zero.

5. **Compare Values from Both Sets:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (total of three comparisons):
     - Convert the value from the first set at this index into an integer.
     - Convert the value from the second set at this index into an integer.
     - If the two integer values are not equal:
       - Increment the counter of differences by 1.

6. **Evaluate the Results:**
   - If the number of differences is less than 3:
     - Output "YES" (indicating there is at least one matching value).
   - Otherwise, output "NO" (indicating all values differ).

7. **End the program.**

**Example Usage:**
- The user inputs two sets of numbers, and depending on how many numbers are the same, a "YES" or "NO" response is provided based on the comparison logic defined above. 

**Final Note:** Review the logic to ensure it aligns with the intended functionality of comparing two numerical sets.
