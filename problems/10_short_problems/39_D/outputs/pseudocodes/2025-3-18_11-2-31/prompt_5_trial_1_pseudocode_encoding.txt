**Purpose:** The program compares two sets of three numerical inputs to determine how many of those numbers differ between the two sets, then indicates whether the differences are less than three.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Main Function:**
   - Define a function named `runComparison`.

2. **Accept Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first set of three numbers and store it as `firstSet`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second set of three numbers and store it as `secondSet`.

3. **Split Input into Separate Numbers:**
   - Separate the numbers in `firstSet` into a list called `firstNumbers`.
   - Separate the numbers in `secondSet` into a list called `secondNumbers`.

4. **Initialize Difference Counter:**
   - Create a variable `differenceCount` and set it to 0. This will be used to count how many numbers are different between the two sets.

5. **Compare Numbers:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the three numbers):
     - Convert the numbers at the current index in `firstNumbers` and `secondNumbers` to integers and store them as `numberFromFirstSet` and `numberFromSecondSet` respectively.
     - If `numberFromFirstSet` is not equal to `numberFromSecondSet`:
       - Increase `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Evaluate Differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES" (indicating that fewer than 3 numbers differ).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating that at least 3 numbers differ).

7. **Execute Main Function:**
   - Run the `runComparison` function if this script is executed directly.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The program is designed for user interaction, getting inputs during execution.
- It processes simple numeric comparisons and utilizes a counting method to convey results based on the differences between two sets of numbers.
- Minimal complexity allows for easy understanding of workflows and logic.
