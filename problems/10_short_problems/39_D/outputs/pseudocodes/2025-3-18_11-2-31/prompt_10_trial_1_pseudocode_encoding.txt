Here is the pseudocode based on the provided Python code, following the guided steps:

```plaintext
FUNCTION doMain
    // Input: Two strings representing sequences of numbers
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    
    // Read input values for t1 and t2
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 INTO LIST
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 INTO LIST

    // Initialize result counter
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER
    SET res TO 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of tt1 and tt2
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Parse the string elements as integers
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER
        SET a TO INTEGER value of tt1[index]
        SET b TO INTEGER value of tt2[index]

        // Compare the two integers a and b
        IF a is NOT equal to b THEN
            // Increment the result counter if the values are different
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the result counter
    IF res is LESS than 3 THEN
        // If less than 3 differences, print "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // If 3 or more differences, print "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function if this is the main module
IF this is the main module THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

### Key Components Identified:
- **Input:** The program receives two strings.
- **Splitting Input:** The strings are split into lists of substrings.
- **Loop and Compare:** A loop iterates through the first three values, comparing them.
- **Conditional Check:** A conditional checks how many values differ and prints a result based on that.

### Assumptions Stated:
- Inputs are assumed to be valid strings of integers separated by spaces.
- It is assumed that there are at least three integer values in each input string.

### Clarity and Readability:
- Each action, variable declaration, and flow condition is clearly stated to improve understanding.
- Meaningful identifiers highlight their purpose within the logic.
