Below is the pseudocode that captures the intent and flow of the provided Python code while keeping it clear and structured.

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of data
    SET inputSet1 TO READ_USER_INPUT()
    SET inputSet2 TO READ_USER_INPUT()
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    SET valuesSet1 TO SPLIT_STRING(inputSet1)
    SET valuesSet2 TO SPLIT_STRING(inputSet2)

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Compare corresponding items in both sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current items to integers for comparison
        SET currentValue1 TO CONVERT_TO_INTEGER(valuesSet1[index])
        SET currentValue2 TO CONVERT_TO_INTEGER(valuesSet2[index])
        
        // Check if the current values are different
        IF currentValue1 IS NOT EQUAL TO currentValue2 THEN
            // Increment the counter if values are different
            INCREMENT differenceCount
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine if there are fewer than 3 differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // Output indicating similarities
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO" // Output indicating significant differences
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
CALL main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function and Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts with defining a function `main` that encompasses the logic of the original code, indicating where user input is read.
2. **Data Processing**: It demonstrates splitting the input into values, highlighting the transformation from string to list.
3. **Logic Flow**: The pseudocode outlines the loop that checks the differences between values and counts them.
4. **Conditional Logic**: It clearly states the conditions for outputting "YES" or "NO" based on the counted differences.
5. **Structured and Indented**: Each block is neatly organized to improve readability and comprehension, effectively guiding the reader through the program's flow.
