**Purpose:** This program compares two sets of three numbers and checks if they differ in less than three places.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read the first set of numbers from the user.
   - Read the second set of numbers from the user.

3. **Split the Input:**
   - Separate the first set of numbers into individual elements (let's call this 'FirstSet').
   - Separate the second set of numbers into individual elements (let's call this 'SecondSet').

4. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set a variable called 'DifferenceCount' to zero. This will track how many numbers are different between the two sets.

5. **Compare the Numbers:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (covering three positions):
     - Convert the number in 'FirstSet' at that index to an integer (let's call this 'NumberFromFirstSet').
     - Convert the number in 'SecondSet' at that index to an integer (let's call this 'NumberFromSecondSet').
     - If 'NumberFromFirstSet' is not equal to 'NumberFromSecondSet':
       - Increase the 'DifferenceCount' by 1.

6. **Evaluate the Differences:**
   - If 'DifferenceCount' is less than 3:
     - Print "YES" (indicating the sets are similar).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating the sets are not similar).

7. **End the Program**

**End of Pseudocode** 

This pseudocode effectively outlines the logic of the original code in a clear and understandable manner, making the process of comparing two sets of numbers accessible to readers with varying levels of programming knowledge.
