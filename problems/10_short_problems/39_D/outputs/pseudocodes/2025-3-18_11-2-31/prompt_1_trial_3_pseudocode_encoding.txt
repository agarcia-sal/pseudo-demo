**Pseudocode:**

1. Define a function named `doMain` to execute the main logic.
2. Read input values from the user for the first set of data and store it in a variable named `firstInput`.
3. Read input values for the second set of data and store it in a variable named `secondInput`.
4. Split `firstInput` into a list named `firstNumbers` using whitespace as the delimiter.
5. Split `secondInput` into a list named `secondNumbers` using whitespace as the delimiter.
6. Initialize a counter variable `differenceCount` to zero.
7. Repeat the following process for each index from 0 to 2:
   a. Convert the value at the current index of `firstNumbers` to an integer and store it in a variable named `firstValue`.
   b. Convert the value at the current index of `secondNumbers` to an integer and store it in a variable named `secondValue`.
   c. If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`, increment the `differenceCount` by one.
8. If the value of `differenceCount` is less than 3, print "YES".
9. Otherwise, print "NO".
10. Call the `doMain` function to execute the program.
