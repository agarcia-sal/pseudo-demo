Here is a clear and concise pseudocode translation of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION doMain
    DECLARE variable t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE variable t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE variable tt1 AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE variable tt2 AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE variable res AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO 0

    // Get user input for two strings
    OUTPUT "Enter first input:"
    READ t1
    OUTPUT "Enter second input:"
    READ t2

    // Split input strings into lists based on spaces
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 BY SPACE
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 BY SPACE

    // Compare the elements of each list
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE variable a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE variable b AS INTEGER
        SET a TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        SET b TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the elements at index x are not equal
        IF a NOT EQUAL b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1

    // Check the result and print appropriate output
    IF res LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"

END FUNCTION

IF this program is executed THEN
    CALL doMain
END IF
```

### Explanation of Assumptions:
- It assumes that inputs are well-formed and contain at least three space-separated integers for both strings `t1` and `t2`.
- The comparisons are made on integers, hence the conversion from string to integer is implicitly assumed to be successful.
