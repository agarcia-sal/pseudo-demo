Here's the pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read two input strings from the user
    INPUT firstString
    INPUT secondString
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of elements
    SPLIT firstString INTO list firstList
    SPLIT secondString INTO list secondList
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the elements to integers for comparison
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine the result based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The pseudocode starts with defining a main function that encapsulates the logic.
  
2. **Input Handling**: It describes the process of reading two strings from the user and splitting them into lists.

3. **Difference Counting**: The pseudocode elaborates on a loop that checks each corresponding pair of elements in the lists for inequality and counts the differences.

4. **Conditional Output**: Finally, it includes a conditional statement that checks if the count of differences is less than 3 to determine the final output.

5. **Readability**: Each step is broken down, and the logic flows in a clear and structured manner, making it easily understandable.
