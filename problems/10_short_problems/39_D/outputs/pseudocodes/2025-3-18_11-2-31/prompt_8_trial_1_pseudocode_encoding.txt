**Purpose Summary**: The primary goal of this program is to compare two sets of three integer inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three positions, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main()

    // Step 1: Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into a list of numbers
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList

    // Step 3: Initialize a count for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Step 4: Compare each corresponding number from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the elements from strings to integers
        SET numberFromFirstList TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET numberFromSecondList TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER

        // If the numbers are not equal, increase the difference count
        IF numberFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO numberFromSecondList THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Evaluate the number of differences to determine the output
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF this script is the main module THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The program begins by prompting the user for two separate inputs, which should represent two sets of numbers.
   
2. **List Creation**: It splits each input string into a list of individual numbers for easier comparison.

3. **Difference Count Initialization**: A counter is established at zero to tally how many numbers differ between the two lists.

4. **Looping Through Numbers**: The program then uses a loop to systematically compare the numbers at each position in the two lists (for the first three positions).

5. **Conditionally Incrementing the Count**: If a difference is found (the numbers in the same position from both lists are not equal), the difference count is incremented.

6. **Final Evaluation and Output**: Finally, based on the total number of differences counted, the program either prints "YES" if the count is less than three or "NO" if it is three or more.

This pseudocode is structured to enhance clarity, making it accessible for readers regardless of their familiarity with programming languages. Each step is broken down logically, while maintaining a focus on the program's purpose.
