**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Define a Function `doMain`**
   
3. **Receive Input:**
    - Prompt the user to input the first set of data and store it as `firstInput`.
    - Prompt the user to input the second set of data and store it as `secondInput`.
   
4. **Process Input:**
    - Split `firstInput` into individual components and store them in a list called `firstList`.
    - Split `secondInput` into individual components and store them in a list called `secondList`.

5. **Initialize a Counter:**
    - Create a variable `differenceCount` and set it to 0. This will track the number of differences between the two input lists.

6. **Compare Elements of the Lists:**
    - For each index from 0 to 2 (for a total of three comparisons):
        - Convert the element at the current index in `firstList` to an integer and store it in `firstValue`.
        - Convert the element at the current index in `secondList` to an integer and store it in `secondValue`.
        - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`, increase `differenceCount` by 1.

7. **Determine and Output Result:**
    - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
        - Print "YES"
    - Else:
        - Print "NO"

8. **Execute the Main Function:**
   - If this file is being run directly, call the `doMain` function to start the program.

**End Program** 

**Input Requirements:** Two lines of input where each line contains three integer values.

**Output Requirements:** Either "YES" if there are fewer than three differences between the two sets of integers or "NO" if there are three or more differences.
