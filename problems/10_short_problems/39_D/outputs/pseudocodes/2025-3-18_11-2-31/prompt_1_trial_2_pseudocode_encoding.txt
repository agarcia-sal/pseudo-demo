```plaintext
FUNCTION MainProcedure
    // Read two input strings
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput

    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DIFFERENCE_COUNT = 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2
        // Convert the current elements of both lists to integers
        SET firstNumber TO INTEGER OF firstList[index]
        SET secondNumber TO INTEGER OF secondList[index]

        // Check if the elements are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT DIFFERENCE_COUNT BY 1

    // Check if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF DIFFERENCE_COUNT IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // Indicate that there are fewer than 3 differences
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO" // Indicate that there are 3 or more differences

END FUNCTION

// Execute the main procedure
CALL MainProcedure
``` 

This pseudocode conveys the same logic as the original code: it reads two sets of three numbers, counts the number of differences between corresponding elements, and outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the number of differences.
