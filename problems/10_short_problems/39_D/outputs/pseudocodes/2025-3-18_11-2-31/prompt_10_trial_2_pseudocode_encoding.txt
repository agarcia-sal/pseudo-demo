Hereâ€™s the pseudocode representation based on the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Step 1: Read input strings
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    t1 = GET user input
    t2 = GET user input

    // Step 2: Split input strings into lists of strings
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    tt1 = SPLIT t1 by whitespace
    tt2 = SPLIT t2 by whitespace

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER
    res = 0 

    // Step 4: Loop through the elements of the lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER
        a = CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        b = CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER

        // Count the number of differences
        IF a NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            res = res + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Check the number of differences and output result
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Main program execution starts here
CALL doMain()
```

### Summary of the Pseudocode Components:
1. **Input Handling:** Captures user inputs as strings.
2. **Data Processing:** Splits the strings into lists and processes each element.
3. **Looping Structure:** Iterates a fixed number of times to compare elements of the two lists.
4. **Conditional Statements:** Checks for differences and decides on the output based on the count of those differences.
5. **Functionality:** Maintains clarity and ensures that all variable types and states are properly declared and used.
