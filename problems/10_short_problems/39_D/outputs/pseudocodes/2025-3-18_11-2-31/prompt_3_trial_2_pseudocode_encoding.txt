Here's the pseudocode that encapsulates the logic of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    DEFINE firstInput AS GET user input
    DEFINE secondInput AS GET user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    DEFINE firstValues AS SPLIT firstInput into list
    DEFINE secondValues AS SPLIT secondInput into list
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DEFINE differenceCount AS 0
    
    // Loop to compare the first three elements from both input lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers for comparison
        DEFINE firstValue AS CONVERT firstValues[index] TO integer
        DEFINE secondValue AS CONVERT secondValues[index] TO integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the counter if they differ
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check the total count of differences and print the result
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition**: The main part of the algorithm is encapsulated in a main function.
  
2. **Input Handling**: It begins by collecting two inputs from the user and splits them into lists.

3. **Comparison Logic**: Using a loop, it compares the first three elements of both lists, counting how many of them differ.

4. **Condition Check**: After the loop, it checks if the number of differences is less than three to determine the output ("YES" or "NO").

5. **Flow Control**: The pseudocode includes clear control structures for loops and conditionals, facilitating easy understanding of the logic flow. 

This format should be easy to follow, even for someone without programming expertise.
