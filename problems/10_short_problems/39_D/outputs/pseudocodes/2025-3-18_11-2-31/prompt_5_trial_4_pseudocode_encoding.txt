**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they are similar enough to yield a positive response.

### Pseudocode:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Accept two lines of input from the user
    SET firstInput TO user input
    SET secondInput TO user input

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstList TO split firstInput by spaces
    SET secondList TO split secondInput by spaces

    // Step 3: Initialize a variable to count differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Step 4: Compare corresponding elements of the two lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstNumber TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondNumber TO convert secondList[index] to integer

        // If the numbers are not equal, increment the difference count
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Step 5: Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Step 6: Execute the main function when the script runs
CALL main
```

### Breakdown of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The program first takes two lines of user input, which are expected to contain three numbers each.
  
2. **Splitting Input:** It splits each input string into a list of individual elements, preparing them for comparison.

3. **Comparison Logic:** A loop compares corresponding elements from the two lists of numbers. If any pair of numbers is not the same, it increases a counter.

4. **Decision Making:** After checking all numbers, the program checks how many differences are present. If there are fewer than three differences, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Execution:** The main function is called automatically when the program is run, ensuring the comparison and output are executed. 

This structured approach should provide clarity on the functionality and logic of the original code without requiring knowledge of programming language conventions.
