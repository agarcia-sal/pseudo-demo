**Pseudocode:**

BEGIN

    PROMPT user for the first set of values and store it in 'firstSet'
    PROMPT user for the second set of values and store it in 'secondSet'
    
    // Split the input values into lists
    SPLIT 'firstSet' into a list called 'firstValues'
    SPLIT 'secondSet' into a list called 'secondValues'
    
    // Initialize a counter to track differing values
    SET differenceCount to 0 

    // Loop through each of the first three values in both lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        
        // Convert the current values at the index from the string list to integers
        SET valueFromFirstSet to integer value of 'firstValues[index]'
        SET valueFromSecondSet to integer value of 'secondValues[index]'
        
        // Check if the values from both sets are different
        IF valueFromFirstSet is not equal to valueFromSecondSet THEN
            
            // Increment the counter when a difference is found
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF

    END FOR

    // Determine the output based on the number of differences found
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // Indicating fewer than 3 differences
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO" // Indicating 3 or more differences
    END IF

END

// The main function executes when the program starts
IF the program is executed THEN

END IF
