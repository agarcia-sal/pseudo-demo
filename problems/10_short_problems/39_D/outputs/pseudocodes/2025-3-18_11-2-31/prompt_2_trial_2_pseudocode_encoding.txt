**Pseudocode:**

1. Define a function called "doMain".
  
2. **Input Handling:**
   - Read a line of input from the user and store it in a variable called "firstInput".
   - Read a second line of input from the user and store it in a variable called "secondInput".
   - Split "firstInput" into individual elements and store them in a list called "firstList".
   - Split "secondInput" into individual elements and store them in a list called "secondList".

3. Initialize a variable called "differenceCount" to zero. This variable will keep track of how many elements are different between the two lists.

4. **Comparison Loop:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
      - Convert the element at the current index in "firstList" to an integer and store it in a variable called "firstValue".
      - Convert the element at the current index in "secondList" to an integer and store it in a variable called "secondValue".
      - If "firstValue" is not equal to "secondValue":
         - Increment "differenceCount" by one.

5. **Output Decision:**
   - If "differenceCount" is less than 3:
      - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
      - Print "NO".

6. **Execution Trigger:**
   - If the program is being run as the main program, call the "doMain" function to execute the logic.

**Summary:**
The program compares two sets of three integers inputted by the user and counts how many of the corresponding integers are different. If fewer than three integers differ, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
