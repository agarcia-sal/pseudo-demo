Here is the pseudocode that translates the provided Python code into clear and understandable logic:

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Step 1: Read two lines of input from the user
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Step 2: Split the input lines into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of each list
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements from strings to integers
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER

        // Step 5: Compare the two values
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter if values are different
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Check the number of differences found
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Execute the Main function when the program runs
CALL Main
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

- **Function Definition**: The pseudocode defines a main function that contains all the operations needed for the program.
- **Input Handling**: It starts by getting two lines of input from the user.
- **Splitting**: Each line is split into separate components (presumably numbers) stored in lists.
- **Difference Counting**: A loop runs through the first three components of both lists, comparing corresponding values and counting how many are different.
- **Conditional Logic**: After determining the count of differences, it checks if the count is less than three to decide the output.
- **Readable Structure**: The pseudocode uses clear names and structures the logic with comments to facilitate understanding.
