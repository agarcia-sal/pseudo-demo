**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
FUNCTION doMain
    // Step 1: Read input from user
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    t1 ← INPUT "Enter the first set of numbers: "
    t2 ← INPUT "Enter the second set of numbers: "
    
    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    tt1 ← SPLIT t1 INTO LIST
    tt2 ← SPLIT t2 INTO LIST
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER
    res ← 0 
    
    // Step 4: Compare elements in both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER
        a ← CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        b ← CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF a ≠ b THEN
            res ← res + 1 
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    // Step 5: Output result based on differences
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Step 6: Program entry point
IF this script is executed THEN
    CALL doMain
ENDIF
```

### Assumptions:
- The input strings `t1` and `t2` will always contain exactly three space-separated numbers.
- The conversion of string to integer will succeed without errors (e.g., valid integer inputs are provided).
