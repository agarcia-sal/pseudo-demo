### Purpose
The code is designed to compare two sets of three integer inputs, determining how many differences exist between corresponding elements. Based on the number of differences, it outputs "YES" if there are fewer than three differences and "NO" if there are three or more.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read two lines of input, each containing three integers
    INTEGER_LIST firstInput = readInput()      // Get the first set of integers
    INTEGER_LIST secondInput = readInput()     // Get the second set of integers

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INTEGER differenceCount = 0

    // Loop through each pair of numbers from both inputs
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        INTEGER firstNumber = convertToInteger(firstInput[index])   // Convert to integer
        INTEGER secondNumber = convertToInteger(secondInput[index]) // Convert to integer

        // Check if the two numbers are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            Increment differenceCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Based on the count of differences, print the result
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Helper function to read input and split it into a list
FUNCTION readInput
    STRING inputLine = readInputLine() // Read a line from user input
    RETURN splitStringIntoList(inputLine) // Split the line into separate strings
END FUNCTION

// Helper function to convert strings to integers
FUNCTION convertToInteger(stringValue)
    RETURN integerValue(stringValue) // Convert and return the integer representation of the string
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode Structure
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode includes functions to read input and convert strings into lists of integers.
2. **Difference Counting**: A loop checks each integer from both inputs for differences, incrementing a counter whenever a difference is found.
3. **Conditional Output**: After evaluating all pairs, the program checks how many differences were recorded and outputs either "YES" (for fewer than three differences) or "NO" (for three or more differences).

### Comments for Clarity
- The pseudocode breaks down complex operations into simpler steps, offering clarity on input processing and integer comparison.
- The initial reading and parsing of input is abstracted into functions to emphasize modularity and readability. 

This pseudocode aims to present the original logic in an easily understandable format, making it accessible to readers without a programming background while retaining the structure and intent of the code.
