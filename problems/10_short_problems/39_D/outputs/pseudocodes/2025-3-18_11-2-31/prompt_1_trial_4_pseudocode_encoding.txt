**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION Main():
    // Read two lines of input
    Input firstLine
    Input secondLine

    // Split the input lines into lists of strings
    Split firstLine into list firstList
    Split secondLine into list secondList

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    Set differenceCount to 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        Set valueA to integer of firstList[index]
        Set valueB to integer of secondList[index]
        
        // Check if the elements are different
        IF valueA is NOT equal to valueB THEN:
            // Increment the difference counter
            Increment differenceCount by 1

    // After checking all elements, determine the output
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN:
        Print "YES"
    ELSE:
        Print "NO"

// Call the main function
CALL Main()
```

**Input Format:**
- The program expects two lines of input containing strings of space-separated numbers.

**Output Format:**
- The output will be "YES" if fewer than 3 corresponding numbers are different between the two input lists; otherwise, it will print "NO".
