Hereâ€™s the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Gather input values
    INPUT firstInput FROM user
    INPUT secondInput FROM user

    // Split the input strings into lists
    SPLIT firstInput INTO list firstValues
    SPLIT secondInput INTO list secondValues

    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS 0 

    // Compare the elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string values to integers
        SET firstValue TO integer of firstValues[index]
        SET secondValue TO integer of secondValues[index]

        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Evaluate the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF mainScript IS RUN THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Context and Explanation:

1. **Inputs:** The program takes two lines of input from the user, where each line is expected to have three space-separated integers.
2. **Logic:** It splits both input strings into lists of integers and counts how many of those integers differ from one list to the other.
3. **Decision Making:** If fewer than three elements differ, it prints "YES", indicating some level of similarity. If three or more elements differ, it prints "NO", indicating a lack of similarity. 
4. **Control Structures:** The pseudocode uses a loop to iterate through the lists and an if-statement to check for differences in each corresponding integer.
