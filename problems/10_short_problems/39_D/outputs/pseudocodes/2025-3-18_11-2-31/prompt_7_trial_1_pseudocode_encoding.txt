Here's a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided Python code, capturing its logic and operations:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read input values from the user
    INITIALIZE firstInput AS STRING
    INITIALIZE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = INPUT("Enter first set of numbers: ")
    secondInput = INPUT("Enter second set of numbers: ")
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    INITIALIZE firstList AS LIST OF STRINGS
    INITIALIZE secondList AS LIST OF STRINGS
    firstList = SPLIT(firstInput)
    secondList = SPLIT(secondInput)
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 
    
    // Compare elements from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        INITIALIZE firstNumber AS INTEGER
        INITIALIZE secondNumber AS INTEGER
        firstNumber = CONVERT(firstList[index] TO INTEGER)
        secondNumber = CONVERT(secondList[index] TO INTEGER)
        
        // If numbers differ, increment the difference counter
        IF firstNumber != secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check the number of differences and print the result
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function if this file is run directly
IF currentFileIsMain THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **Input and List Creation**: The code first collects two sets of three numbers as input from the user, separating them into lists.
2. **Comparison Logic**: It compares corresponding elements of the two lists and counts how many of them are different.
3. **Decision Logic**: Based on the count of differences, the program prints "YES" if fewer than three elements differ, otherwise it prints "NO".
4. **Control Structures**: The pseudocode clearly outlines the use of loops and conditional statements, maintaining high-level descriptions of operations. 

This structured approach aids in understanding the algorithm without getting bogged down in implementation details.
