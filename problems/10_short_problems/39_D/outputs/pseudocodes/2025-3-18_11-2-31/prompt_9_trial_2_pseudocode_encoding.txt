**Purpose:** This algorithm compares two sets of three integer values and determines whether they differ in less than three places.

---

1. **Receive Input:** 
   - Get two lines of input from the user. Each line contains three integers separated by spaces.

2. **Process Input:**
   - Split the first input line into a list of strings.
   - Split the second input line into a separate list of strings.

3. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Create a variable to count the number of positions where the corresponding integers differ; start the counter at zero.

4. **Compare Values:**
   - For each position from 0 to 2 (three total positions):
     - Convert the string values from both lists at the current position into integers.
     - Check if the integers from both lists are different:
       - If they are different, increase the counter by one.

5. **Evaluate Result:**
   - After completing the comparison, check if the counter of differences is less than three:
     - If it is less than three, print "YES".
     - Otherwise, print "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING

    // Get user input for both sets of numbers
    firstInput = GET user input
    secondInput = GET user input

    // Split the inputs into lists of strings for processing
    DECLARE listOfFirstNumbers AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE listOfSecondNumbers AS LIST OF STRING

    listOfFirstNumbers = SPLIT firstInput BY spaces
    listOfSecondNumbers = SPLIT secondInput BY spaces

    // Initialize a difference counter
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0

    // Compare corresponding numbers in both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE numberA AS INTEGER
        DECLARE numberB AS INTEGER

        numberA = CONVERT listOfFirstNumbers[index] TO INTEGER
        numberB = CONVERT listOfSecondNumbers[index] TO INTEGER

        // Increase count if numbers differ
        IF numberA != numberB THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Check if the number of differences is less than three
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL main
```

**Notes:**
- This pseudocode clearly outlines the steps taken in the original program, maintaining the logic and flow while using simple and descriptive language suitable for a general audience.
- Each step of the algorithm is broken down into logical components to aid in understanding.
