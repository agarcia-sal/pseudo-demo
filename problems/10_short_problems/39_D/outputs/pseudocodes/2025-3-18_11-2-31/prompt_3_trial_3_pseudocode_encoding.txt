Here is the pseudocode that translates the provided Python code snippet into a more understandable format:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Get input from the user
    PROMPT user for first set of values and store it in variable firstSet
    PROMPT user for second set of values and store it in variable secondSet

    // Step 2: Split the inputs into separate values
    SPLIT firstSet into list firstValues
    SPLIT secondSet into list secondValues

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount to 0 

    // Step 4: Compare the corresponding values from both sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert values to integer type for comparison
        SET valueA to integer of firstValues[index]
        SET valueB to integer of secondValues[index]

        // If values are different, increment the difference counter
        IF valueA is NOT equal to valueB THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        ENDIF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Evaluate the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Entry point for the program execution
CALL main
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts by prompting for input values, mimicking user interaction in a readable manner.
2. **Data Processing:** It clearly describes the process of splitting input values into lists for better readability.
3. **Logic Representation:** The use of a loop emphasizes the comparisons being made between the two sets of values, while conditions are laid out to assess the number of differences.
4. **Decision Making:** The final conditional check interprets the results and prints the required output based on the number of differences found.

Overall, this pseudocode captures the logical flow of the original code while removing specific syntax to enhance clarity for readers unfamiliar with programming languages.
