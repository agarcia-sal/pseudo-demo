Here is a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Get input strings representing two sets of three integers
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of integers
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList
    
    // Initialize result counter for differing integers
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Compare corresponding integers from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert elements to integers for comparison
        SET firstInteger TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondInteger TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if they are different
        IF firstInteger NOT EQUAL secondInteger THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check the number of differing integers
    IF differenceCount LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF this_file_is_main THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode

1. **Function Definition:** The pseudocode defines a function called `main()` which encapsulates the program's logic.
2. **Input Handling:** The input is taken as two strings, each expected to contain three space-separated integers.
3. **Splitting Input:** The inputs are split and stored in two lists, enabling easy access to each integer.
4. **Counter Initialization:** A counter, `differenceCount`, is initialized to track how many integers differ between the two lists.
5. **Loop for Comparison:** The pseudocode uses a loop to iterate through each of the three integers, converting them for comparison.
6. **Difference Counting:** If corresponding integers from the two lists are not equal, the counter is incremented.
7. **Final Check and Output:** After the loop, it checks the counter; if fewer than three integers are different, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
8. **Program Entry Point:** The pseudocode includes a check to ensure that the `main()` function runs only when the script is executed directly.

This format maintains clarity while ensuring a comprehensive overview of the program's logic and flow without going into low-level details.
