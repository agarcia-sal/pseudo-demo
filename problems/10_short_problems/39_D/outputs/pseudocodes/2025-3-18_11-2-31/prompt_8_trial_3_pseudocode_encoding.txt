**Purpose Statement:** The code compares two sets of three numerical inputs and determines if they differ in fewer than three positions, outputting "YES" if they do and "NO" if they do not.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION Main()
    // Get input from the user
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput
    
    // Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput INTO list1
    SPLIT secondInput INTO list2
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstNumber TO CONVERT list1[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondNumber TO CONVERT list2[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the numbers are not equal
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            // Increment the difference count
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine if the count of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // There are less than 3 differences
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"  // There are 3 or more differences
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program by calling the main function
CALL Main()
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The program starts by receiving two lines of input, which represent two sets of numbers.
- It splits these inputs into lists, allowing for individual item comparison.
- A loop iterates through each item, checking for differences and counting them.
- Finally, it evaluates the count of differences to determine the output.
