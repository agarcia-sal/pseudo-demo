### Explanation:
- The function `main` is the entry point of the program.
- It reads two lines of input, which are expected to contain three space-separated integers each.
- It processes these inputs by splitting them into lists and comparing corresponding elements to count how many are different.
- At the end, if fewer than three differences are found, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". 
- Additional functions for reading input, splitting strings, and converting data types can be defined as required.
