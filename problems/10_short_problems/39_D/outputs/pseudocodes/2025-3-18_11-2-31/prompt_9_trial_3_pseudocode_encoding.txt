**Purpose:**  
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Main Program**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user, store it as the first set of numbers (`firstSet`).
   - Read another line of input from the user, store it as the second set of numbers (`secondSet`).

3. **Split Input into Individual Numbers:**
   - Divide `firstSet` into a list of three strings (`firstList`).
   - Divide `secondSet` into a list of three strings (`secondList`).

4. **Initialize Count of Differences:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0 to keep track of how many numbers differ between the two sets.

5. **Compare Corresponding Numbers:**
   - For each index in the range of three:
     - Convert the string at the current index in `firstList` to an integer (`firstNumber`).
     - Convert the string at the same index in `secondList` to an integer (`secondNumber`).
     - If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Evaluate Results:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES" (indicating the sets differ in fewer than three places).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating the sets differ in three or more places).

7. **End Main Program**

**Input:** Two lines containing three space-separated numbers each.  
**Output:** A string "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison of the two sets of numbers.
