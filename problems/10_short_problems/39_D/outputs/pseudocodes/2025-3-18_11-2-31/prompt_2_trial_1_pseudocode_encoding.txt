### Pseudocode

**Input:**
- Read two lines of input: first score list (t1) and second score list (t2).

**Process:**
1. Split both input lines into separate elements:
   - Create a list of scores (tt1) from the first input line (t1).
   - Create a list of scores (tt2) from the second input line (t2).

2. Initialize a variable (differenceCount) to count how many scores differ between the two lists. Set it to zero.

3. For each score position (from 0 to 2):
   - Convert the score from tt1 at this position to an integer (scoreA).
   - Convert the score from tt2 at this position to an integer (scoreB).
   - Compare scoreA and scoreB:
     - If scoreA is not equal to scoreB, increment the differenceCount by one.

4. After comparing all three scores, check the differenceCount:
   - If the differenceCount is less than 3, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

**Output:**
- Print "YES" if fewer than 3 scores are different; otherwise, print "NO".

**Overall Logic:**
The program takes two sets of three scores, compares them, and determines if they differ significantly. If they differ in fewer than three positions, it indicates a minor difference (output "YES"); if they differ in all three positions, it indicates a significant difference (output "NO").
