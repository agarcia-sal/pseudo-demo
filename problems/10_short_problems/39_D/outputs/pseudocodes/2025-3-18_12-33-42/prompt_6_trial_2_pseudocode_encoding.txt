```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstString
    INPUT secondString
    
    // Split each input string into a list of strings
    SPLIT firstList INTO firstString.split()
    SPLIT secondList INTO secondString.split()

    // Initialize a counter for different elements
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through the first three elements in both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the elements are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the counter of different elements
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1

    // Check if the count of different elements is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES" // Output YES if fewer than 3 elements are different
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO" // Output NO if 3 or more elements are different
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
CALL main()
``` 

### Summary:
1. The `main` function processes two inputs by splitting them into lists.
2. It counts how many corresponding elements (from both lists) are different.
3. If the count of differing elements is less than 3, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
