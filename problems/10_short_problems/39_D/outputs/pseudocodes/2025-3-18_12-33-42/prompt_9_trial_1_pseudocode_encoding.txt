### Purpose:
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three integer values and determine how many values differ between them. If fewer than three values are different, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode:

```
BEGIN Main Program

    // Step 1: Get input from the user
    PROMPT user for first set of three integers
    STORE the first set as 'firstSet'
    
    PROMPT user for second set of three integers
    STORE the second set as 'secondSet'
    
    // Step 2: Process the input
    INITIALIZE a difference counter to 0
    
    // Step 3: Compare the two sets item by item
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        SET firstValue to the integer at 'firstSet' at the current index
        SET secondValue to the integer at 'secondSet' at the current index
        
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT the difference counter by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 4: Determine the output based on differences
    IF difference counter is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END Main Program
```

### Explanation of Logic and Flow:
1. The program begins by gathering input for two sets of three integers from the user.
2. It initializes a counter to track how many integers differ between the two sets.
3. It uses a loop to compare each corresponding integer in the two sets.
4. It increments the counter whenever it finds a difference.
5. After comparing all integers, it evaluates the total count of differences and prints "YES" or "NO" based on whether the count is fewer than three. 

This pseudocode format abstracts away technical specifics while clearly conveying the logic and flow of the original program, making it easily understandable for readers without technical programming background.
