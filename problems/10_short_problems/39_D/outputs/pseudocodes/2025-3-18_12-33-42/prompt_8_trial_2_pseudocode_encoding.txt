**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sequences of three numerical values and determine how many values differ between them. It outputs "YES" if fewer than three values are different, and "NO" if three or more values differ.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main():
    // Read two lines of input, each containing three numbers
    INPUT string1
    INPUT string2
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    LIST numbers1 = split(string1)  // Split the first input by spaces
    LIST numbers2 = split(string2)  // Split the second input by spaces
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DIFFERENCE_COUNT = 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2:
        // Convert the current elements to integers for comparison
        INTEGER number1 = convert_to_integer(numbers1[index])  // Convert first list value to integer
        INTEGER number2 = convert_to_integer(numbers2[index])  // Convert second list value to integer
        
        // Compare the two numbers
        IF number1 is NOT EQUAL TO number2 THEN:
            // If they differ, increment the difference counter
            DIFFERENCE_COUNT = DIFFERENCE_COUNT + 1
    
    // After comparing, check how many differences were found
    IF DIFFERENCE_COUNT is LESS THAN 3 THEN:
        OUTPUT "YES"  // Print "YES" if fewer than three differences
    ELSE:
        OUTPUT "NO"   // Print "NO" if three or more differences

// Start the program by calling the main function
CALL main()
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The `split` function is used to divide the input strings into individual numbers based on spaces.
- The `convert_to_integer` function represents the action of converting a string number into an integer.
- The loop iterates over three indices, as we expect exactly three numbers in each input line.
- The final conditional check decides the output based on the count of differing numbers.
