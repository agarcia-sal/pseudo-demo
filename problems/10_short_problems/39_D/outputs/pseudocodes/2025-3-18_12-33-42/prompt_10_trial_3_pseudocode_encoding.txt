Here's the translation of the provided Python code into structured pseudocode:

```
BEGIN MainProcedure
    // Declare input variables for two sets of data
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE tt1 AS ARRAY OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS ARRAY OF STRING
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO 0
    DECLARE a AS INTEGER
    DECLARE b AS INTEGER

    // Read input values from the user
    OUTPUT "Enter values for the first set:"
    INPUT t1
    OUTPUT "Enter values for the second set:"
    INPUT t2

    // Split input strings into arrays
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 INTO ARRAY
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 INTO ARRAY

    // Loop through the first three elements of both arrays
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string values to integers
        SET a TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        SET b TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER

        // Increment the result if the values are not equal
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the result and print the appropriate message
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE 
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END MainProcedure

// Entry point of the program
CALL MainProcedure
```

### Explanation of Key Components:
1. **Input and Output Operations:** 
   The code reads inputs (`t1` and `t2`) and outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on a comparison.

2. **Data Handling:** 
   The inputs are processed into lists (`tt1` and `tt2`) by splitting the string inputs.

3. **Looping and Conditional Logic:**
   A loop iterates over the first three elements to compare their integer values, incrementing a counter (`res`) for each mismatch.

4. **Final Condition Checking:**
   The logic checks if the mismatches are less than three to determine and print the final result.

### Assumptions
- Inputs are assumed to be space-separated integers.
- The program assumes that both input strings will contain at least three elements to avoid index errors.
