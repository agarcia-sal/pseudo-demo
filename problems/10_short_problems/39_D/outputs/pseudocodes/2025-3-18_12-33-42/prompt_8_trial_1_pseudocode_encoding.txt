**Pseudocode Translation:**

**Purpose**: This program compares two sets of three numbers entered by the user and determines if they are similar enough based on a specific condition. If the numbers differ in fewer than three positions, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

```plaintext
FUNCTION MainProgram

    // Step 1: Gather input from the user
    DECLARE firstSet AS string
    DECLARE secondSet AS string
    firstSet = GET user input for the first set of numbers
    secondSet = GET user input for the second set of numbers

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    DECLARE firstNumbers AS list of strings
    DECLARE secondNumbers AS list of strings
    firstNumbers = SPLIT firstSet into a list using space as a separator
    secondNumbers = SPLIT secondSet into a list using space as a separator

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS integer
    differenceCount = 0

    // Step 4: Compare the numbers in both sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE firstNumber AS integer
        DECLARE secondNumber AS integer
        firstNumber = CONVERT firstNumbers[index] to integer
        secondNumber = CONVERT secondNumbers[index] to integer
        
        // If the numbers are different, increase the difference counter
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Step 5: Determine the output based on the count of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    ENDIF

END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
CALL MainProgram
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The program collects two inputs that are expected to contain three space-separated numbers each.
- The logic counts how many numbers are different between the two inputs, focusing only on a comparison of the corresponding positions in each set.
- The output is determined simply by checking if the count of differing numbers is less than three, leading to a user-friendly response.
