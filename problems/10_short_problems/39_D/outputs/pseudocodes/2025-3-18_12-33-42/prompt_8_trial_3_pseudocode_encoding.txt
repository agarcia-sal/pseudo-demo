**Purpose**: The goal of the code is to compare two sets of three numeric values input by the user and to determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they do, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main():
    // Get user input for two sets of values
    SET firstInput TO user input
    SET secondInput TO user input

    // Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SET firstValues TO split firstInput into a list of strings
    SET secondValues TO split secondInput into a list of strings

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through the range of the first three values (0 to 2)
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2:
        // Convert the current values to integers
        SET valueFromFirst TO convert firstValues[index] to integer
        SET valueFromSecond TO convert secondValues[index] to integer

        // Check if the values from both inputs are different
        IF valueFromFirst IS NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecond:
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount < 3:
        PRINT "YES" // Less than three differences
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO" // Three or more differences

// Execute the main function
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of Key Sections:

- **Input Handling**: The program captures user input (two separate lines) and splits them into lists to work with the individual values.
  
- **Difference Counting**: A loop is used to examine each corresponding pair of values from the two inputs. If they differ, a counter is increased.

- **Conditional Output**: After checking all values, a simple condition checks the total number of differences to determine which message to print.

This pseudocode is structured to be easy to understand, with clear variable naming and simplified operations that reflect the original code's logic.
