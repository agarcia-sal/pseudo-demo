**Purpose:** The primary goal of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical values. It counts how many values differ between the two sets and determines whether there are fewer than three differences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Step 1: Accept two lines of input containing numbers
    DECLARE firstLine AS STRING
    DECLARE secondLine AS STRING
    firstLine = INPUT("Enter three numbers separated by spaces:")
    secondLine = INPUT("Enter three numbers separated by spaces:")
    
    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    DECLARE firstSet AS LIST OF NUMBERS
    DECLARE secondSet AS LIST OF NUMBERS
    firstSet = SPLIT firstLine INTO A LIST OF NUMBERS
    secondSet = SPLIT secondLine INTO A LIST OF NUMBERS
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differing values
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0
    
    // Step 4: Compare each corresponding number from both sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE firstNumber AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondNumber AS INTEGER
        
        firstNumber = CONVERT firstSet[index] TO INTEGER
        secondNumber = CONVERT secondSet[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // If the numbers are different, increase the count
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 5: Determine the output based on the count of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Step 6: Execute the main function if the script is run
IF THIS SCRIPT IS RUN AS MAIN THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Comments for Clarity:

1. **Input Handling:** The program prompts the user for two sets of three numbers, ensuring they are separated by spaces.
2. **Data Preparation:** The input strings are split into numerical lists for further processing.
3. **Comparison Logic:** The program checks each corresponding element of the two lists to count how many are different.
4. **Decision Making:** Based on the count of differences, it prints "YES" if there are fewer than three differences and "NO" otherwise.

This structure allows readers to grasp the logic behind the code without any specific programming syntax, making it accessible to individuals unfamiliar with the original language.
