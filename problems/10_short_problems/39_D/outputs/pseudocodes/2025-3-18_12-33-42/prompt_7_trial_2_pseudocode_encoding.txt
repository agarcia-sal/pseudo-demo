Here is a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    DECLARE string firstInput
    DECLARE string secondInput

    READ firstInput from user
    READ secondInput from user

    SPLIT firstInput into list firstNumbers
    SPLIT secondInput into list secondNumbers

    INITIALIZE differenceCount to 0 

    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        SET numberA to integer value of firstNumbers[index]
        SET numberB to integer value of secondNumbers[index]
        IF numberA is NOT equal to numberB THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

IF this script is the main module THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Function Definition**: The primary logic is encapsulated in the `main` function.
2. **Input Handling**: The code accepts two lines of input, which are intended to be three space-separated integers each.
3. **Splitting Input**: The inputs are split into lists of strings representing numbers.
4. **Counting Differences**: A loop iterates three times (for three corresponding numbers), counting how many numbers differ between the two inputs.
5. **Conditional Output**: Based on the count of differences, the function conditionally prints "YES" if fewer than three numbers differ, or "NO" if three or more numbers differ.
6. **Program Execution**: The script checks if it is the main module before calling the `main` function to execute the program. 

This pseudocode maintains high-level abstraction while clearly describing the program's logic and flow.
