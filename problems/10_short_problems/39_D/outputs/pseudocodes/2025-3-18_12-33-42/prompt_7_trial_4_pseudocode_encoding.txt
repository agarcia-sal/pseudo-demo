Certainly! Below is the high-level pseudocode that accurately captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code. 

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Read input values
    INPUT firstInput FROM user
    INPUT secondInput FROM user
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput INTO list firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO list secondList
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS 0
    
    // Iterate over the components of the inputs (assumes both lists have 3 components)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string elements to integers
        ASSIGN firstValue AS integer of firstList[index]
        ASSIGN secondValue AS integer of secondList[index]
        
        // Check for differences between the values
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine if less than 3 differences were found
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main program execution
IF this script is the main program THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

### Explanation of Key Components:
1. **Input Handling**: The function begins by taking two inputs from the user, which are intended to be pairs of values that will be compared.
   
2. **Slicing**: Each input is split into a list so that individual values can be accessed for comparison.

3. **Comparison Logic**: A loop runs three times, comparing corresponding elements from both lists. A counter increases whenever a difference is found between the elements.

4. **Output Decision**: After completing the loop, the number of differences is assessed. If fewer than three differences exist, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The pseudocode effectively describes the overall structure, logic, and flow of the original code, making it accessible for readers with varying levels of programming expertise.
