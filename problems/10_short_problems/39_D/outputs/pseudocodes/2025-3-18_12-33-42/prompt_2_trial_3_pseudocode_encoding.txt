**Pseudocode:**

Start the program

1. **Input Phase:**
   - Read the first line of input and store it as `firstInput`.
   - Read the second line of input and store it as `secondInput`.

2. **Processing Phase:**
   - Split `firstInput` into individual items and store them in a list called `firstValues`.
   - Split `secondInput` into individual items and store them in a list called `secondValues`.
   - Initialize a variable `differenceCount` and set it to 0 to keep track of how many values differ between the two lists.

3. **Comparison Phase:**
   - Repeat the following for each index from 0 to 2 (covering three iterations):
     - Convert the corresponding item from `firstValues` to an integer and store it in a variable called `valueFromFirst`.
     - Convert the corresponding item from `secondValues` to an integer and store it in a variable called `valueFromSecond`.
     - If `valueFromFirst` is not equal to `valueFromSecond`:
       - Increment the `differenceCount` by 1.

4. **Decision Phase:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO"

End the program

**Output Requirements:**
- The program outputs "YES" if fewer than three values differ between the two lists, and "NO" if three or more values differ.
