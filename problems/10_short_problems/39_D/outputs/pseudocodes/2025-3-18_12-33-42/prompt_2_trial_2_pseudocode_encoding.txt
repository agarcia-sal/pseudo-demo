**Pseudocode:**

Begin the program

    Declare a variable to hold the first input string
    Declare a variable to hold the second input string

    Read the first input from the user and store it in the first input variable
    Read the second input from the user and store it in the second input variable

    Split the first input string into a list of substrings, storing the result in a list called firstInputList
    Split the second input string into a list of substrings, storing the result in a list called secondInputList

    Initialize a variable to count differences, setting it to zero

    For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive), perform the following steps:
        Convert the substring from the first list at the current index into an integer and store it in a variable called firstNumber
        Convert the substring from the second list at the same index into an integer and store it in a variable called secondNumber
        
        If firstNumber is not equal to secondNumber:
            Increment the differences count by one

    If the count of differences is less than 3:
        Output "YES"
    Otherwise:
        Output "NO"

End the program
