### Pseudocode

```
Function Main()
    // Read two lines of input
    FirstInput = Get user input for the first set of values
    SecondInput = Get user input for the second set of values
    
    // Split the inputs into lists of values
    FirstValuesList = Split FirstInput into a list
    SecondValuesList = Split SecondInput into a list
    
    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    DifferenceCount = 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three items in both lists
    For each index from 0 to 2 do
        // Convert the current values from both lists to integers
        FirstValue = Convert FirstValuesList[index] to Integer
        SecondValue = Convert SecondValuesList[index] to Integer
        
        // Check if the two values are different
        If FirstValue is not equal to SecondValue then
            // Increment the counter of differences
            Increase DifferenceCount by 1
        End If
    End For
    
    // Evaluate the number of differences to provide output
    If DifferenceCount is less than 3 then
        Print "YES" // Indicating the inputs are similar enough
    Else
        Print "NO"  // Indicating the inputs are too different
    End If
End Function

// Run the Main function when the script is executed
If this script is the main program then
    Call Main()
End If
``` 

### Explanation of Logic:
1. The program starts by reading two lines of input from the user, which contain sets of three values each.
2. It splits these inputs into lists for easier comparison.
3. It uses a loop to iterate through the first three values of each list, converting them to integers for comparison.
4. For each corresponding pair of values, it checks if they are different and counts the number of differences.
5. After checking all three pairs, it evaluates the number of differences:
   - If there are fewer than three differences, it outputs "YES".
   - If there are three or more differences, it outputs "NO". 

This logic indicates how closely related the two sets of inputs are based on their numerical values.
