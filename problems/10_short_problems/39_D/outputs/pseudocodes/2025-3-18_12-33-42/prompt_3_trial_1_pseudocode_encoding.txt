Here's a pseudocode representation of the provided Python code snippet:

```
BEGIN Main Procedure
    // Step 1: Read input values
    READ firstInput
    READ secondInput
    
    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists
    SPLIT firstInput into firstList
    SPLIT secondInput into secondList
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a difference counter
    SET differenceCounter to 0
    
    // Step 4: Compare corresponding elements in the two lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        SET valueA to integer of firstList[index]
        SET valueB to integer of secondList[index]
        
        // If the values are different, increment the difference counter
        IF valueA is not equal to valueB THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCounter by 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    // Step 5: Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCounter is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // There are fewer than 3 differences
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"  // There are 3 or more differences
    ENDIF
END Main Procedure

// Note: Execution starts here
CALL Main Procedure
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The procedure starts by capturing two inputs that contain space-separated numbers.
2. **List Creation**: The inputs are split into lists for easier processing.
3. **Counter Initialization**: A counter (`differenceCounter`) is initialized to track how many positions have differing numbers.
4. **Loop Structure**: A loop iterates through the first three elements of the lists, comparing their values and incrementing the counter if they differ.
5. **Condition Check**: After completing the comparisons, the counter is checked to decide whether to print "YES" or "NO" based on the number of differences.

This pseudocode is structured clearly to help someone unfamiliar with the original code understand what each part of the algorithm does, while avoiding specific programming syntax.
