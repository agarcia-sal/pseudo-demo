**Pseudocode:**

1. **Function Definition: Main Program Logic**
   - Define a function named `doMain`.

2. **Input Handling: Get User Input**
   - Read a line of input from the user and store it as `firstInput`.
   - Read a second line of input from the user and store it as `secondInput`.

3. **Data Processing: Split Inputs into Lists**
   - Split `firstInput` into separate elements using spaces and store the result in a list called `firstList`.
   - Split `secondInput` into separate elements using spaces and store the result in a list called `secondList`.

4. **Comparison Logic: Count Differences**
   - Initialize a variable called `differenceCount` with a value of 0.
   - Repeat the following steps 3 times (for each element in the input lists):
     - Convert the current element from `firstList` to an integer and store it in a variable named `numberFromFirstList`.
     - Convert the current element from `secondList` to an integer and store it in a variable named `numberFromSecondList`.
     - If `numberFromFirstList` is not equal to `numberFromSecondList`, increase `differenceCount` by 1.

5. **Final Decision: Output Result**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

6. **Program Execution: Start the Main Function**
   - If the program is running as the main program, call the function `doMain` to execute the logic.
