**Purpose:** This program compares two sets of three numeric values input by the user to determine how many of them differ. If fewer than three values are different, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first set of numbers and store it as `firstSet`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second set of numbers and store it as `secondSet`.

3. **Split Input into Individual Numbers:**
   - Divide `firstSet` into separate numbers and store them in a list called `firstNumbers`.
   - Divide `secondSet` into separate numbers and store them in a list called `secondNumbers`.

4. **Initialize a Count for Differences:**
   - Set a variable called `differenceCount` to 0.

5. **Compare Corresponding Numbers:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2:
     - Convert the number from `firstNumbers` at the current index to an integer and store it in `numberFromFirst`.
     - Convert the number from `secondNumbers` at the current index to an integer and store it in `numberFromSecond`.
     - If `numberFromFirst` is not equal to `numberFromSecond`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Determine Output Based on Differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

7. **End Program** 

This pseudocode reflects the core logic and flow of the original program while ensuring clarity and simplicity for readers unfamiliar with programming syntax.
