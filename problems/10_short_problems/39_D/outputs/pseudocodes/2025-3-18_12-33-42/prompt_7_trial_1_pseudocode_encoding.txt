Here is the translated pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    PROMPT user to enter first input string
    READ input string t1
    PROMPT user to enter second input string
    READ input string t2
    
    SPLIT t1 into list tt1 by spaces
    SPLIT t2 into list tt2 by spaces
    
    INITIALIZE variable mismatchCount to 0
    
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        CONVERT tt1[index] to integer a
        CONVERT tt2[index] to integer b
        IF a is NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT mismatchCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    IF mismatchCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

CALL main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Purpose Clarification**: The main purpose of the code is to compare two input strings containing integers and report whether they differ in less than three positions.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - **Input**: Two space-separated strings of integers (expected to have exactly three integers each).
   - **Output**: "YES" if the integers differ in fewer than three positions; otherwise, "NO".

3. **Control Structures**:
   - The `FOR` loop iterates three times, comparing corresponding integers from the two lists.
   - The conditional `IF` statements control whether the count of mismatches is incremented and what output to print based on the final count.

This pseudocode effectively communicates the original codeâ€™s algorithm without getting into the minutiae of programming syntax, making it accessible for readers with varying familiarity with code.
