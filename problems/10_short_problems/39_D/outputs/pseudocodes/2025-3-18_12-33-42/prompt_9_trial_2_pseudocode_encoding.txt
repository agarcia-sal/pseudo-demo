**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program**
  
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user for the first line of numbers and store it as `firstInput`.
   - Prompt the user for the second line of numbers and store it as `secondInput`.

3. **Split Input into Individual Numbers:**
   - Divide `firstInput` into a list of numbers called `firstNumbers`.
   - Divide `secondInput` into a list of numbers called `secondNumbers`.

4. **Initialize Difference Counter:**
   - Set `differenceCount` to 0.

5. **Compare Corresponding Numbers:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (for a total of three comparisons):
     - Convert the number in `firstNumbers` at the current index to an integer and store it as `numberFromFirst`.
     - Convert the number in `secondNumbers` at the current index to an integer and store it as `numberFromSecond`.
     - If `numberFromFirst` is not equal to `numberFromSecond`:
       - Increase `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Evaluate the Difference Count:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

7. **End the Program** 

This pseudocode presents a clear outline of the program's logic, allowing readers to understand its purpose and operations without requiring knowledge of specific programming syntax.
