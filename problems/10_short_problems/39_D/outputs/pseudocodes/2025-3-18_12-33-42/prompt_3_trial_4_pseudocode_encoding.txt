Here is the pseudocode that represents the logic of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION doMain
    // Read input values
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = GET user input
    secondInput = GET user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    DECLARE inputList1 AS LIST OF STRINGS = SPLIT firstInput INTO LIST
    DECLARE inputList2 AS LIST OF STRINGS = SPLIT secondInput INTO LIST
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER = 0
    
    // Compare elements from both lists
    FOR i FROM 0 TO 2
        DECLARE value1 AS INTEGER = CONVERT inputList1[i] TO INTEGER
        DECLARE value2 AS INTEGER = CONVERT inputList2[i] TO INTEGER
        
        // Count the differences between the two values
        IF value1 IS NOT EQUAL TO value2 THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
            
    // Check if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"

END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function if this code is run as a script
IF currentExecutionContext IS main THEN
    CALL doMain
END IF
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition**: The `doMain` function is defined to encapsulate the logic.
2. **Input Handling**: It reads and stores two strings, which represent the user inputs.
3. **Splitting Inputs**: It splits the input strings into lists of individual components.
4. **Loop for Comparison**: A loop runs three iterations to check corresponding elements from both input lists.
5. **Difference Counting**: Inside the loop, differences between values are counted.
6. **Condition for Output**: After the loop, it checks if the count of differences is less than three and prints "YES" or "NO" based on that condition.
7. **Execution Check**: At the end, the pseudocode checks if it is being run in the main context to call `doMain`.
