Here is the pseudocode based on the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Step 1: Get inputs from the user
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input
    
    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists
    SET tt1 TO split t1 into list of strings
    SET tt2 TO split t2 into list of strings
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a result counter
    SET res TO 0
    
    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string values to integers
        SET a TO convert tt1[x] to integer
        SET b TO convert tt2[x] to integer
        
        // Step 5: Compare the integers
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    // Step 6: Check the result counter
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Main program execution
CALL doMain()
```

### Assumptions:
- The input strings `t1` and `t2` are expected to contain exactly three integers separated by spaces.
- The conversion of string to integer is presumed to be valid and will not result in any errors.
- The comparisons between the integers will be straightforward, without additional data validation.
