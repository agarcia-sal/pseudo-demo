**Pseudocode for the Given Code**

Begin the program

    Define a function named `doMain`:

        Get input from the user and store it in a variable called `firstInput`
        Get another input from the user and store it in a variable called `secondInput`
        
        Split the first input string into a list of words and store it in `firstList`
        Split the second input string into a list of words and store it in `secondList`
        
        Initialize a variable named `differenceCount` and set it to 0

        For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
            Convert the item at the current index of `firstList` to an integer and store it in `valueFromFirst`
            Convert the item at the current index of `secondList` to an integer and store it in `valueFromSecond`
            If `valueFromFirst` is not equal to `valueFromSecond`:
                Increment `differenceCount` by 1

        If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
            Print "YES"
        Else:
            Print "NO"

End the function

If the program is executed as the main program:

    Call the function `doMain`

End of program

**Input Requirements:**
- The program requires two inputs which are strings of space-separated values.

**Output Requirements:**
- The program outputs "YES" if there are fewer than three differences between the respective elements of the two input lists. Otherwise, it outputs "NO".
