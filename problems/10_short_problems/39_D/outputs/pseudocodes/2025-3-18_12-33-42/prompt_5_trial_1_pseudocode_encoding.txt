### Summary of Purpose
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numbers input by the user and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions, indicating a certain level of similarity.

### Pseudocode
```
FUNCTION main()
    // Get the first set of three numbers from user input
    SET firstInput TO user input
    // Get the second set of three numbers from user input
    SET secondInput TO user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstNumbers TO split firstInput into a list
    SET secondNumbers TO split secondInput into a list

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Compare the corresponding numbers from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the numbers from string to integer for comparison
        SET numberFromFirst TO convert firstNumbers[index] to integer
        SET numberFromSecond TO convert secondNumbers[index] to integer

        // If the numbers are different, increment the difference counter
        IF numberFromFirst IS NOT EQUAL TO numberFromSecond THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Evaluate the total number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // If they differ in fewer than 3 positions, print "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // If they differ in 3 or more positions, print "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program by calling the main function
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode Structure
- **Function Definition:** The program is encapsulated in a function named `main`, which acts as the entry point.
- **Input Handling:** The program gathers two sets of numbers from the user, treating them as strings initially.
- **Data Splitting:** The inputs are split into individual numbers for further processing.
- **Difference Calculation:** A loop runs through the three numbers in both sets, counting how many positions they differ.
- **Output Logic:** Depending on the count of differences, a corresponding message ("YES" or "NO") is printed based on the criteria.
- **Execution Entry Point:** The `main` function is invoked to run the program when executed. 

This pseudocode is designed to be clear and accessible, thereby facilitating understanding for readers unfamiliar with programming languages.
