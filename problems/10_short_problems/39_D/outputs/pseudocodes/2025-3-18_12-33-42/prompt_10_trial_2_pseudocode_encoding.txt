**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Step 1: Input the values for two test cases
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input
    
    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of string elements
    SET tt1 TO split(t1) // Converts the input string to a list of words
    SET tt2 TO split(t2) // Converts the input string to a list of words
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET res TO 0
    
    // Step 4: Compare the elements of the two lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // a and b represent the integers from each list
        SET a TO convert tt1[x] TO integer
        SET b TO convert tt2[x] TO integer
        
        // Step 5: Count the differences between the two lists
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
            
    // Step 6: Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"

// Main execution point
IF this script is the main module THEN
    CALL doMain()
```

### Assumptions:
- The input strings `t1` and `t2` contain exactly three space-separated numbers.
- The inputs can be correctly converted to integers without any errors.
- The comparisons are based on the assumption that the elements at the same indices in `tt1` and `tt2` are comparable.
