**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input representing two sequences of numbers
    firstSequence = INPUT("Enter first sequence of numbers: ")
    secondSequence = INPUT("Enter second sequence of numbers: ")
    
    // Split the input into individual components
    firstList = SPLIT(firstSequence) // Converts the string into a list of strings
    secondList = SPLIT(secondSequence) // Converts the string into a list of strings
    
    mismatchCount = 0 // Initialize a counter for mismatches
    
    // Iterate over the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        numberFromFirst = CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        numberFromSecond = CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the corresponding numbers are different
        IF numberFromFirst IS NOT EQUAL TO numberFromSecond THEN
            INCREMENT mismatchCount BY 1 // Increase the mismatch counter
            
    // After checking all pairs, decide the result based on the number of mismatches
    IF mismatchCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // Less than three mismatches means a certain condition is met
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO" // Three or more mismatches means the condition is not met
        
// Start the program execution
CALL main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by reading two sequences of numbers from the user.
2. **Splitting Input**: It splits each input string into a list of individual strings representing numbers.
3. **Mismatches Counting**: It initializes a count for mismatches, then compares corresponding elements from both lists.
4. **Comparison Logic**: It counts how many elements differ between the two lists.
5. **Conditional Output**: Finally, depending on the count of mismatches, it outputs "YES" if there are fewer than three mismatches, and "NO" otherwise. 
6. **Execution Flow**: The program starts by calling the main function.
