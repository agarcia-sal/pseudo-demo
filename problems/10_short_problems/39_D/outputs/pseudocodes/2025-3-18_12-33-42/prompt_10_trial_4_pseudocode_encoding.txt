Here's the pseudocode based on your provided code:

```
BEGIN Main Function
    // Step 1: Get two input strings from the user
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of words
    SET tt1 TO split t1 into list of words
    SET tt2 TO split t2 into list of words

    // Step 3: Initialize a result counter
    SET res TO 0 

    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Step 5: Convert the elements to integers
        SET a TO integer value of tt1[x]
        SET b TO integer value of tt2[x]
        
        // Step 6: Compare the two integers
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            // Increment the result counter if they are different
            INCREMENT res BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 7: Check the number of differences
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END Main Function

// Assumptions:
// 1. Input strings contain exactly three space-separated integers.
// 2. The integers in the input strings are valid and can be converted to integer type.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Components Identified**: The pseudocode outlines input retrieval, string splitting, looping, comparison, conditionals, and output.
2. **Clear Steps**: Each main operation is broken down into distinct steps, simplifying complex operations like comparisons and integer conversions.
3. **Assumptions Included**: Clarifications on data structure integrity (input format) are made for context.
4. **Readability Focused**: Identifiers and actions are straightforward and directly related to the logic of the original code.
5. **Present Tense Utilized**: All actions are phrased in the present tense to reflect ongoing processes.
