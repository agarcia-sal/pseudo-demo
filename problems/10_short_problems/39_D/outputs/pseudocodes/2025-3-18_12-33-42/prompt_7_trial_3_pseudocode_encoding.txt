Here is the high-level pseudocode that describes the logic and operations of the given Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Get two input strings containing numbers
    STRING input1 = GET_USER_INPUT()
    STRING input2 = GET_USER_INPUT()
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    LIST_OF_STRING numbers1 = SPLIT_STRING(input1)
    LIST_OF_STRING numbers2 = SPLIT_STRING(input2)
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INTEGER differenceCount = 0 
    
    // Iterate through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR INTEGER index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the substrings to integers
        INTEGER value1 = CONVERT_TO_INTEGER(numbers1[index])
        INTEGER value2 = CONVERT_TO_INTEGER(numbers2[index])
        
        // If the two values are not equal, increment the difference counter
        IF value1 IS NOT EQUAL TO value2 THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Helper functions
FUNCTION GET_USER_INPUT()
    // Return user input as a string
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION SPLIT_STRING(input)
    // Return a list of substrings split by white space
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CONVERT_TO_INTEGER(stringValue)
    // Return the integer representation of the string
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF PROGRAM_IS_RUNNING_DIRECTLY THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding Purpose:** The code compares two sets of three integers each, counting how many of them differ, and outputs "YES" if fewer than three integers differ, otherwise "NO".
  
2. **Meaningful Names:** Variable and function names are chosen to instantly convey what they do, such as `GET_USER_INPUT`, `SPLIT_STRING`, and `CONVERT_TO_INTEGER`.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** The pseudocode avoids specific syntax and implementation details, focusing instead on the logical steps.

4. **Control Structures:** Loops and conditionals are expressed clearly, outlining the flow of the algorithm in simple terms.

5. **Input and Output:** It specifies that inputs are taken from user input and describes the expected output.

6. **Structured Format:** The use of indentation and clear sectioning makes the structure easy to follow.

7. **Natural Language:** The language used is straightforward, making it accessible for readers of various backgrounds.

8. **Clarity Review:** The pseudocode is coherent and effectively mirrors the original code's logic.

9. **Context for Complexity:** The differences in values are counted in a straightforward loop, simplifying the understanding of this logic.

10. **Final Output Expectations:** The pseudocode captures the essence of the program and clarifies what happens under different scenarios, aligning it with the original intent.
