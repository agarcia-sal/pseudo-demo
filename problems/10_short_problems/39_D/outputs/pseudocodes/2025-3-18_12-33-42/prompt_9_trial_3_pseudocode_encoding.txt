**Purpose:**  
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numeric inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions, outputting "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Main Process:**
   - Define a function called `doMain`.

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user and store it as `firstInput`.
   - Read a second line of input from the user and store it as `secondInput`.

3. **Split Inputs into Components:**
   - Split `firstInput` into individual components and store them in a list called `firstList`.
   - Split `secondInput` into individual components and store them in a list called `secondList`.

4. **Initialize a Difference Counter:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0, which will count how many positions differ between the two lists.

5. **Compare Corresponding List Elements:**
   - For each position from 0 to 2 (representing the first three elements of each list):
     - Convert the elements at the current position in `firstList` and `secondList` to integers, storing them as `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` respectively.
     - If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`, increment the `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Check the Number of Differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

7. **Execute the Main Process:**
   - If this script is run as the main program, call the `doMain` function.

**End of Pseudocode** 

This pseudocode provides a clear and logical flow of the original program without any specific programming syntax, making it accessible for readers with varying levels of technical expertise.
