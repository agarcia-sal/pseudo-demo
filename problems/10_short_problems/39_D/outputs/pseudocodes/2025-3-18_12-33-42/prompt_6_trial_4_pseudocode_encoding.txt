Here is the pseudocode that reflects the logic of the provided Python code, structured for clarity and ease of understanding:

```
FUNCTION doMain
    // Read two separate lines of input from the user
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList

    // Initialize a counter for the number of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements from string to integer
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the two values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // If there are less than 3 differences, output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO"
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL doMain
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode Structure
1. **Function Definition**: Clearly defined a main function that encapsulates the algorithm.
2. **Input Handling**: Directly reflects the input operations, converting them into descriptive actions.
3. **Looping Structure**: Summarizes the iteration process to compare values in the lists.
4. **Condition Checks**: Clearly articulates the conditional logic used to evaluate differences between input values.
5. **Output Logic**: Explains the decision-making process for final output based on the count of differences.
6. **Readability**: Uses simple language and consistent indentation for easy reading and understanding.

This pseudocode effectively represents the underlying algorithm without getting into the specific syntax details, making it very accessible.
