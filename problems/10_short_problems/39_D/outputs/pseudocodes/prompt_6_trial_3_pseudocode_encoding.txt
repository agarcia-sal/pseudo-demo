Here's the pseudocode that translates the original Python code into a clear and understandable format:

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Read two lines of input 
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstList TO split firstLine into individual elements
    SET secondList TO split secondLine into individual elements

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondList[index] to integer

        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Check the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // If there are less than 3 differences, print "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // If there are 3 or more differences, print "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF

END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL Main
```

This pseudocode outlines the program's logic in a clear and structured way, describing the steps in a more accessible manner, while avoiding specific programming language syntax.
