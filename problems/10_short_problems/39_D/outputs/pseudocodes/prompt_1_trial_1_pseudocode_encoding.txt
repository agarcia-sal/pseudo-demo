**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION MAIN 
    // Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements of both lists to integers
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER

        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check if the count of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE 
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Call MAIN when the script is executed
CALL MAIN
``` 

This pseudocode outlines the main logic of the original code, highlighting the key steps of reading input, processing data, and outputting results while avoiding specific programming language syntax.
