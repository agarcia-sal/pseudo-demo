// Purpose: This program compares two sets of three numbers and determines if they differ in fewer than three positions.

FUNCTION main()
    // Step 1: Receive input for the first set of numbers
    SET firstNumberSet TO input from user

    // Step 2: Receive input for the second set of numbers
    SET secondNumberSet TO input from user

    // Step 3: Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstNumbersList TO split firstNumberSet into components
    SET secondNumbersList TO split secondNumberSet into components

    // Step 4: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Step 5: Compare the components of both number sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 INCLUSIVE DO
        SET firstNumber TO convert firstNumbersList[index] into integer
        SET secondNumber TO convert secondNumbersList[index] into integer

        // Step 6: Check if the numbers are different
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // Step 7: Determine the result based on the count of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"

// Main program execution
CALL main()

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode clearly states that it receives two sets of numbers as input.
2. **Comparison Logic:** It explicitly defines the process of comparing each number and counting differences.
3. **Output Decision:** The logic for determining the output based on the count of differences is straightforward and highlights the conditions clearly.
4. **Simplicity:** The complex operations have been simplified for clarity, making it easier to understand the algorithm's overall flow without specific programming syntax.
