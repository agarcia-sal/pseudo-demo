Here is the pseudocode representation of the given Python code, following the specified guided steps:

```
FUNCTION doMain
    DECLARE t1, t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE tt1, tt2 AS ARRAY OF STRING
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO 0

    // Get input from user
    SET t1 TO USER INPUT 
    SET t2 TO USER INPUT 

    // Split the input strings into lists
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 INTO ARRAY OF STRINGS
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 INTO ARRAY OF STRINGS

    // Compare elements of the two arrays
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
        
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the number of differences and print the result
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main program execution
CALL doMain()
```

### Explanation of Components:
1. **Functions**: A `doMain` function encapsulates the main logic of the program.
2. **Input**: Uses `USER INPUT` to gather string inputs.
3. **Data Structures**: Implements arrays to hold split string values.
4. **Loop**: A `FOR` loop iterates over a range to compare corresponding values from the two input arrays.
5. **Conditionals**: `IF` statements determine when `res` should be incremented and which message to print based on the comparison results.
6. **Assumptions**: The pseudocode assumes the inputs are always valid and consist of three space-separated integers per input string.

### Clarity and Readability:
Meaningful identifiers like `res`, `tt1`, and `tt2` enhance readability, indicating their roles clearly. The use of present tense constructs conveys an active voice in the actions being taken.
