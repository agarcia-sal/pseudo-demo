Here is the pseudocode based on the provided guidelines:

```
START Function doMain

    // Step 1: Take two inputs
    SET t1 to user input
    SET t2 to user input

    // Step 2: Split inputs into lists of strings
    SET tt1 to split t1 into a list of strings
    SET tt2 to split t2 into a list of strings

    // Step 3: Initialize a result counter
    SET res to 0 

    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of the lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        SET a to convert tt1[index] to integer
        SET b to convert tt2[index] to integer
        
        // Step 5: Compare the numbers and update the counter
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res by 1 

    // Step 6: Check the result counter
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"

END Function doMain

// Step 7: Execute the doMain function if this script is run as the main program
IF this script is the main program THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

### Key Components Identified:
- **Input Handling:** Collecting two inputs from the user.
- **Data Manipulation:** Splitting inputs into lists and converting to integers.
- **Loop Structure:** A loop to iterate through three elements.
- **Conditional Statements:** Comparison and result evaluation with corresponding output. 

### Assumptions:
- The inputs entered by the user will be valid integers separated by spaces.
- The lists tt1 and tt2 will always contain three elements since the loop runs three times.
