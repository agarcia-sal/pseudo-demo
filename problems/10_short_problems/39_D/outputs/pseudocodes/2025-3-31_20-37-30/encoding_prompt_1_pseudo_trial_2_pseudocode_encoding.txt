**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input
    firstInput = READ INPUT
    secondInput = READ INPUT
    
    // Split the inputs into lists of strings
    firstList = SPLIT firstInput INTO LIST
    secondList = SPLIT secondInput INTO LIST
    
    // Initialize a variable to count differences
    differenceCount = 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three positions of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements of each list to integers
        numberFromFirstList = CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        numberFromSecondList = CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the numbers at the current position are different
        IF numberFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO numberFromSecondList THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL main()
```

**Explanation:**
- The pseudocode begins with defining a main function that encapsulates the primary logic of the program.
- It reads two inputs from the user, which are then split into lists of individual elements.
- A loop iterates over the first three elements of both input lists, compares them, and counts how many positions differ.
- After evaluating the differences, it outputs "YES" if the count of differences is less than 3, otherwise it outputs "NO".
