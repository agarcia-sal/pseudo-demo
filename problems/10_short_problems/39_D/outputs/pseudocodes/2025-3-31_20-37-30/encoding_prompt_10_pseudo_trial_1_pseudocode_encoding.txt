Here is the pseudocode based on the provided Python code:

```
BEGIN Main Function
    // Step 1: Receive user input
    SET t1 to user input
    SET t2 to user input
    
    // Step 2: Split input strings into lists of strings
    SET tt1 to split t1 into a list of words
    SET tt2 to split t2 into a list of words
    
    // Step 3: Initialize the result counter
    SET res to 0
    
    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Step 5: Convert string elements to integers
        SET a to convert tt1[index] to integer
        SET b to convert tt2[index] to integer
        
        // Step 6: Check for inequality
        IF a is NOT equal to b THEN
            INCREMENT res by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 7: Determine output based on the result counter
    IF res is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END Main Function

// Step 8: Run Main function when the program starts
IF this script is executed THEN
    CALL Main Function
END IF
```

### Assumptions:
- The inputs provided by the user are valid and can be split into exactly three components as integers.
- No additional error handling is implemented, and inputs are expected to conform to the required format.
