**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they do, the output should be "YES," otherwise "NO."

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Get the first set of numbers from the user and store it as the string `firstSet`.
   - Get the second set of numbers from the user and store it as the string `secondSet`.

3. **Split Input Strings into Lists:**
   - Convert `firstSet` into a list of strings called `numbersSet1` by splitting the string.
   - Convert `secondSet` into a list of strings called `numbersSet2` by splitting the string.

4. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Create a variable called `differenceCount` and set it to 0. This will track how many positions differ between the two sets.

5. **Compare Each Position:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the three positions):
     - Convert the value from `numbersSet1` at the current index to an integer and store it in `num1`.
     - Convert the value from `numbersSet2` at the same index to an integer and store it in `num2`.
     - If `num1` is not equal to `num2`:
       - Increase `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Output the Result:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO"

7. **End Program**

This pseudocode effectively conveys the original codeâ€™s intent and logic in a simplified manner, ensuring clarity and readability for individuals unfamiliar with programming syntax.
