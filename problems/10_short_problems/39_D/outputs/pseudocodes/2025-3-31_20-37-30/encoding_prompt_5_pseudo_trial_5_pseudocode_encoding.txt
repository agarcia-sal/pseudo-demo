**Purpose:** The program compares two sets of three integer values and determines if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main():
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    Input firstLine
    Input secondLine
    
    // Split the input lines into individual values and store them in lists
    firstValues = Split firstLine into a list of strings
    secondValues = Split secondLine into a list of strings
    
    // Initialize a counter to count the number of differing values
    differenceCount = 0
    
    // Loop through the first three values of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2:
        // Convert the current values from strings to integers
        valueFromFirst = Convert firstValues[index] to integer
        valueFromSecond = Convert secondValues[index] to integer
        
        // If the current values do not match, increase the difference counter
        IF valueFromFirst is NOT equal to valueFromSecond:
            Increase differenceCount by 1
            
    // After checking all values, determine if the differences are acceptable
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3:
        Print "YES" // The values differ in fewer than three positions
    ELSE:
        Print "NO" // The values differ in three or more positions
        
// Call the main function to execute the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of Key Parts:
- **Input Handling**: The program begins by accepting two strings of input from the user.
- **Splitting Inputs**: Each input string is split into a list of individual string values for further processing.
- **Counting Differences**: A loop is used to compare the corresponding values from both input lists. If any values do not match, a counter is increased.
- **Output Decision**: After the loop, a conditional checks the value of the counter to decide the appropriate output ("YES" or "NO") based on whether the number of differences is acceptable.

### Comments for Clarity:
- Comments are included to explain each major step, enhancing understanding for readers with little programming knowledge.
- The structure follows a logical flow of actions, making it easy to follow and understand the program's intent and logic.
