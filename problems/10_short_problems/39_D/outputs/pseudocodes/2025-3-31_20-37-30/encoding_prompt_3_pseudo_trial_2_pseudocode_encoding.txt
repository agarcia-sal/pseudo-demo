Here's a structured pseudocode that captures the core logic of the given Python code:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Get input values
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = GET user input
    secondInput = GET user input

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of strings
    DECLARE firstList AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE secondList AS LIST OF STRING
    firstList = SPLIT firstInput by spaces
    secondList = SPLIT secondInput by spaces

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Step 4: Compare the corresponding elements of the two lists
    FOR EACH index FROM 0 TO 2
        DECLARE firstElement AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondElement AS INTEGER
        
        firstElement = CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        secondElement = CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // If elements are different, increment the counter
        IF firstElement NOT EQUAL secondElement THEN
            differenceCount = DIFFERENCE COUNT + 1 
        ENDIF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Step 6: Execute the main function if the program is run as main
IF program is run as main THEN
    CALL main
ENDIF
```

### Summary of Pseudocode
1. **Input Handling:** It begins by accepting two strings input from the user.
2. **Data Manipulation:** The program splits input strings into lists based on spaces.
3. **Logic and Counting:** It compares three corresponding values from each list to count how many are different.
4. **Output Decision:** Based on the count of differences, it outputs either "YES" if there are fewer than three differences, or "NO" otherwise.
