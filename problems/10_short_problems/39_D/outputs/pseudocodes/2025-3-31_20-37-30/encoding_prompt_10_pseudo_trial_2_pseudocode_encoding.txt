Here is the pseudocode based on the given structured code:

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Obtain two strings from user input
    SET string1 TO input from user
    SET string2 TO input from user

    // Split the strings into lists of elements
    SET list1 TO split string1 into elements
    SET list2 TO split string2 into elements

    // Initialize a variable to count the differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the elements to integers
        SET valueA TO convert list1[index] to integer
        SET valueB TO convert list2[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF valueA IS NOT equal to valueB THEN
            // Increment the difference count
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if fewer than 3 differences are found
    IF differenceCount IS LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute main function if this is the program entry point
IF this is the main program THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

### Assumptions
- The input strings consist of space-separated numbers.
- The values in the strings can be successfully converted to integers.
- The number of elements in the input strings is guaranteed to be at least three.
