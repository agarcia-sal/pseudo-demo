**Pseudocode:**

Begin main process

    // Step 1: Gather input
    Declare firstInput as a String
    Declare secondInput as a String
    Read firstInput from user
    Read secondInput from user
    
    // Step 2: Split input into individual components
    Declare firstInputComponents as a list of Strings obtained by splitting firstInput
    Declare secondInputComponents as a list of Strings obtained by splitting secondInput
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    Set differenceCounter to 0
    
    // Step 4: Compare corresponding components from both inputs
    For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
        Convert firstInputComponents at index to an integer and store it in firstValue
        Convert secondInputComponents at index to an integer and store it in secondValue
        
        // If the values are not equal, increment the difference counter
        If firstValue is not equal to secondValue:
            Increment differenceCounter by 1
    
    // Step 5: Determine and output the result based on the number of differences
    If differenceCounter is less than 3:
        Output "YES"
    Else:
        Output "NO"
  
End main process
