**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a function called doMain.**
   
2. **Read two strings from user input:**
   - Let the first string be called firstInput.
   - Let the second string be called secondInput.

3. **Split the firstInput into a list of strings, called firstList.**
4. **Split the secondInput into a list of strings, called secondList.**

5. **Initialize a variable called differencesCount to zero.**

6. **For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):**
   - Convert the value at the current index in firstList to an integer and store it in a variable called firstValue.
   - Convert the value at the current index in secondList to an integer and store it in a variable called secondValue.
   - If firstValue is not equal to secondValue:
     - Increment differencesCount by one.

7. **After checking all three pairs of values, do the following:**
   - If differencesCount is less than 3:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

8. **If the script is executed directly (not imported):**
   - Call the doMain function to execute the program. 

**Input and Output:**
- **Input:** Two strings representing space-separated values.
- **Output:** A string "YES" if the number of differing pairs is less than 3; otherwise, "NO".
