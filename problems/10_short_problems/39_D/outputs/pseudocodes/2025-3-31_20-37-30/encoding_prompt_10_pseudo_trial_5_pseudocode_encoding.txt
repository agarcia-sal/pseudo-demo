**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Step 1: Read two lines of input
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET tt1 TO split t1 by space
    SET tt2 TO split t2 by space
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a count for differences
    SET res TO 0

    // Step 4: Compare corresponding elements in the two lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Step 4a: Convert string elements to integer
        SET a TO convert tt1[x] to integer
        SET b TO convert tt2[x] to integer

        // Step 4b: Check for differences
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Check the count of differences and output the result
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main Execution Block
CALL doMain()
```

### Assumptions:
- The two inputs are assumed to be strings that can be split into exactly three space-separated integer values.
- The values are valid integers, and can be successfully converted from string to integer.
- The output should be printed directly to the console. 

### Notes:
- Each step is outlined clearly for readability, making it easy to understand the flow and logic of the original code.
