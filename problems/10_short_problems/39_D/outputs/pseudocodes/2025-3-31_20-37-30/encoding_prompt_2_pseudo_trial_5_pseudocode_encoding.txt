**Pseudocode for the Given Python Code**

1. **Start the program**
   
2. **Define the main function**
   
   a. **Read input from the user**
      - Store the first input line as variable `firstInput`
      - Store the second input line as variable `secondInput`
   
   b. **Split the first input into separate elements and store them in a list called `firstList`**
   
   c. **Split the second input into separate elements and store them in a list called `secondList`**
   
   d. **Initialize a variable called `differenceCount` to zero**
   
   e. **For each index from 0 to 2**
      - Convert the element from `firstList` at the current index into an integer and store it in variable `firstValue`
      - Convert the element from `secondList` at the current index into an integer and store it in variable `secondValue`
      
      - **If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`**
         - Increment `differenceCount` by 1
   
   f. **If `differenceCount` is less than 3**
      - Output "YES"
   
   g. **Otherwise**
      - Output "NO"

3. **Execute the main function when the program runs**
