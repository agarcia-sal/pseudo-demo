**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    differenceCount = 0 
    
    // Iterate through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        firstValue = CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        secondValue = CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values from both lists are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Call the main function
CALL main()
``` 

**Explanation of the pseudocode:**
- The pseudocode starts by defining a main function where inputs are taken.
- It splits each input line into separate elements to compare.
- A loop compares the first three values from both lists, counting how many values differ.
- Depending on the count of differences, it prints "YES" if there are fewer than three differences, otherwise it prints "NO".
