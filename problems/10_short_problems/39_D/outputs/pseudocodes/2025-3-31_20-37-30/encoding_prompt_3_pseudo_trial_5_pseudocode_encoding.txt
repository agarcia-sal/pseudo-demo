### Explanation:

- **Function Signature**: The pseudocode starts with a `FUNCTION main()` declaration to outline the main workflow of the program.
- **Input Handling**: It clearly indicates taking input from the user and assigns meaningful variable names to store split strings.
- **Counting Differences**: Establishes a loop that iterates only three times (as the array size is fixed at 3) to compare corresponding elements from both lists.
- **Conditional Checks**: Uses straightforward conditionals to evaluate whether elements are different and modify the counts accordingly.
- **Output Control**: It includes logic for determining the output based on the count of differing elements, summarized in simple language.
- **Program Execution**: Finally, it specifies how to call the main function to start the execution. 

This structure allows someone unfamiliar with the original Python code to grasp the key logic and flow without needing to know Python syntax.
