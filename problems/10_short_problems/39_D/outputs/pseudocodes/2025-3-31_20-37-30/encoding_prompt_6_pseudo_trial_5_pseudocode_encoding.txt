Here is the pseudocode that captures the logic and operations from the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input
    READ input1
    READ input2

    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    SPLIT input1 INTO list1
    SPLIT input2 INTO list2

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements from the lists to integers
        SET value1 TO INTEGER(list1[index])
        SET value2 TO INTEGER(list2[index])

        // Check if the values are different
        IF value1 IS NOT EQUAL TO value2 THEN
            // Increment the difference count
            INCREMENT differenceCount
        END IF
    END FOR

    // If the number of differences is less than 3, output "YES"
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Otherwise, output "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function when the script is run
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition**: The code defines a main function where all the operations take place.
  
2. **Input Handling**: It collects two lines of input, which will be compared. 

3. **Data Processing**: The inputs are split into lists for easy access to individual values.

4. **Counting Differences**: A loop iterates over the first three elements of both lists, checking for discrepancies and updating a counter accordingly.

5. **Conditionals for Output**: After counting the differences, a conditional statement determines whether to print "YES" (if there are fewer than 3 differences) or "NO" (if there are 3 or more differences).

6. **Execution**: The main function is called if the script is executed.

This high-level pseudocode ensures clarity and conveys the essential logic of the original code without the need for specific programming language syntax.
