**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three integers and determine if they differ in less than three positions, returning "YES" if they do and "NO" if they don't.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN Main Function
    // Step 1: Receive input
    SET firstInput TO get user input as string
    SET secondInput TO get user input as string
    
    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    SET firstList TO split firstInput string into parts
    SET secondList TO split secondInput string into parts
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Step 4: Loop through the indices of the lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Step 4a: Convert the string elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondList[index] to integer
        
        // Step 4b: Check if the two values are different
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        
    // Step 5: Evaluate the count of differences
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
END Main Function

// Execute the main function when the program runs
IF program is executed THEN
    CALL Main Function
END
```

**Explanation:**
- The program initiates by collecting input from the user for two separate sets of integers.
- The inputs are split into separate values, and then a loop counts how many integers are different between the two sets.
- Lastly, based on the count of differences, the program outputs "YES" if there are fewer than three differences, or "NO" if there are three or more differences.
