Pseudocode:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read input strings from the user
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of words
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCounter TO 0 
    
    // Iterate through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO convert firstList[index] TO integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondList[index] TO integer
        
        // Check if the values from both lists are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCounter BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // After comparing all three values, check the difference counter
    IF differenceCounter IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Trigger the main function when the program starts
CALL main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading two strings of input, which are intended to be compared.
2. **Splitting Input**: Both input strings are split into arrays of words (or numbers in this case).
3. **Counter Initialization**: A counter is set up to track how many values differ between the two lists.
4. **Loop Through Values**: A loop runs three times (for three values), performing the following: 
   - Converts the string values from both lists to integers.
   - Compares the two integers; if they are different, the counter increments.
5. **Result Evaluation**: After the loop, the code checks the counter:
   - If fewer than three values are different, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".
6. **Function Execution**: The main function is called to execute the logic when the program starts.

The pseudocode maintains clarity while effectively summarizing the core functionality of the original code.
