**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Main Function:**
   - Create a function called "doMain".

2. **Input Collection:**
   - Prompt the user for the first input string and store it in a variable called "firstInputString".
   - Prompt the user for the second input string and store it in a variable called "secondInputString".

3. **String Splitting:**
   - Split the "firstInputString" into a list of strings called "firstInputList".
   - Split the "secondInputString" into a list of strings called "secondInputList".

4. **Result Initialization:**
   - Initialize a variable called "differenceCount" and set it to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of differences between corresponding elements of the two input lists.

5. **Comparison Loop:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the first three elements of both input lists):
     - Convert the element in "firstInputList" at the current index into an integer and store it in a variable called "firstValue".
     - Convert the element in "secondInputList" at the current index into an integer and store it in a variable called "secondValue".
     - If "firstValue" is not equal to "secondValue":
       - Increment the "differenceCount" by 1.

6. **Result Evaluation:**
   - After completing all comparisons, check if "differenceCount" is less than 3:
     - If true, output the message "YES".
     - Otherwise, output the message "NO".

7. **Execution Trigger:**
   - Execute the "doMain" function only if this script is run as the main program. 

This pseudocode captures the logic of the original code, including how inputs are processed, compared, and how outputs are generated based on the comparisons made.
