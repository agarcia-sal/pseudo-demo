### Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: The main logic is encapsulated in the `doMain` function which is called in the execution context at the bottom.
- **Input Handling**: The code reads two lines of user input and splits them into lists for comparison.
- **Mismatch Counting**: A for loop iterates over a fixed range to compare corresponding elements of the two lists and counts how many are different.
- **Condition to Print Result**: After counting mismatches, it checks if there were fewer than 3 mismatches to determine the output. 
- **Readable Structure**: Each logical block of code is separated and described, making the pseudocode self-explanatory.
