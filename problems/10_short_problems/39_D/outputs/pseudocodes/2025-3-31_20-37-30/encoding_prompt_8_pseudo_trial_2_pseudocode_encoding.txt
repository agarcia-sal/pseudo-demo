**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

---

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Step 1: Get two strings of numbers from the user
    GET inputString1 FROM user
    GET inputString2 FROM user

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into individual numbers
    SPLIT inputString1 INTO numbersList1
    SPLIT inputString2 INTO numbersList2

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Step 4: Compare each corresponding number in the two lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        SET number1 TO CONVERT numbersList1[index] TO integer
        SET number2 TO CONVERT numbersList2[index] TO integer

        // Step 5: Check if the numbers are different
        IF number1 IS NOT EQUAL TO number2 THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1

    // Step 6: Determine if the count of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"

END FUNCTION

// Trigger the main function if the script is run directly
IF this script is executed THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

**Explanation**: 
- The program begins by taking two inputs from the user, which are strings containing numbers.
- It splits these strings into lists of numbers and then compares each corresponding number in the two lists.
- A counter is used to count the number of differences found during the comparison.
- Finally, if there are fewer than three differences, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". 

This pseudocode breaks down the original codeâ€™s logic clearly, making it easier to understand without leaning on programming-specific terms.
