**Purpose**: The primary goal of this code is to compare two sets of three numbers and determine if they differ in less than three places. If they do, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION MainProgram
    // Step 1: Read two lines of input
    DECLARE firstSet AS STRING
    DECLARE secondSet AS STRING
    firstSet = READ input from user
    secondSet = READ input from user

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    DECLARE listFirst AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE listSecond AS LIST OF STRINGS
    listFirst = SPLIT firstSet by spaces
    listSecond = SPLIT secondSet by spaces

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Step 4: Compare each number in the two lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current numbers from strings to integers
        DECLARE numberFromFirst AS INTEGER
        DECLARE numberFromSecond AS INTEGER
        numberFromFirst = CONVERT listFirst[index] to INTEGER
        numberFromSecond = CONVERT listSecond[index] to INTEGER

        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF numberFromFirst is NOT EQUAL TO numberFromSecond THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"   // Less than three differences
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"    // Three or more differences
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Step 6: Execute the main program
IF this file is being run as the main program THEN
    CALL MainProgram
END IF
```

**Comments**:
- The pseudocode is structured to mirror the flow of the original code while using clear language and concepts.
- Each operational step is broken down to its essentials to ensure readability and understanding for those unfamiliar with programming.
