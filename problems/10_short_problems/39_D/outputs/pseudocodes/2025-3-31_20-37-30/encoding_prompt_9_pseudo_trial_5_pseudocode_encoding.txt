**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical values and determine whether they differ in fewer than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three positions, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read the first set of numbers from the user and store it in a variable named `firstSet`.
   - Read the second set of numbers from the user and store it in a variable named `secondSet`.

3. **Process Input:**
   - Split `firstSet` into a list of individual numbers called `firstNumbers`.
   - Split `secondSet` into a list of individual numbers called `secondNumbers`.

4. **Initialize Differences Counter:**
   - Set a variable named `differenceCount` to 0 to keep track of how many positions the numbers differ.

5. **Compare Numbers:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the three positions):
     - Convert the number at the current index in `firstNumbers` to an integer and store it in a variable named `firstNumber`.
     - Convert the number at the current index in `secondNumbers` to an integer and store it in a variable named `secondNumber`.
     - If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`:
       - Increase `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Determine Output:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

7. **End the program.** 

This pseudocode maintains the same logic and flow as the original code while being accessible and easy to understand.
