**Purpose Statement:** The program compares two sets of three numerical values and determines if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three positions, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO."

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Main Function:**
   - Create a function named `doMain`.

2. **Accept Input:**
   - Read the first line of user input and store it as `firstInput`.
   - Read the second line of user input and store it as `secondInput`.

3. **Split Input Values:**
   - Split `firstInput` into a list of values called `firstValues`.
   - Split `secondInput` into a list of values called `secondValues`.

4. **Initialize Counter:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0. This will track how many values differ between the two input lists.

5. **Compare Value Pairs:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the value at index `x` in `firstValues` to an integer and store it as `firstValue`.
     - Convert the value at index `x` in `secondValues` to an integer and store it as `secondValue`.
     - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`, increase `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Output Result:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

7. **Execute Main Function:**
   - If this script is being run as the main program, call the `doMain` function.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The program checks how many values from two provided sets differ.
- The result is conditional based on the number of differing values: fewer than three differences results in "YES"; three or more leads to "NO". 

This pseudocode is structured to be easily understandable, using clear names and a logical flow that mirrors the operations of the original code without specific programming syntax.
