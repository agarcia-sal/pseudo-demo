### Purpose
The primary goal of this code is to compare two sets of three integers provided by the user and determine if they are different in fewer than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three positions, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION main()
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING

    // Get inputs from the user
    firstInput = GET user input for the first set of numbers
    secondInput = GET user input for the second set of numbers

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    DECLARE firstSet AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE secondSet AS LIST OF STRINGS

    firstSet = SPLIT firstInput into individual numbers
    secondSet = SPLIT secondInput into individual numbers

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Compare each corresponding number in both sets
    FOR EACH index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE firstNumber AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondNumber AS INTEGER

        firstNumber = CONVERT firstSet[index] to INTEGER
        secondNumber = CONVERT secondSet[index] to INTEGER

        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            Increment differenceCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the count of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Handling**: The program begins by capturing two strings of numbers from user input.
2. **String Splitting**: These strings are then split into lists that contain individual numeric values.
3. **Comparison Loop**: A loop iterates over each corresponding pair of numbers from the two lists. Each pair is compared, and a counter is incremented each time there is a difference.
4. **Output Decision**: After the loop, the program checks if the count of differences is less than three and outputs "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

This pseudocode clearly conveys the flow and logic of the original program while being accessible and understandable.
