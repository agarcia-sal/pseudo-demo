**Pseudocode for the Given Code**

```
FUNCTION doMain
    // Step 1: Input two strings
    DECLARE string t1, t2
    t1 = GET user input
    t2 = GET user input
    
    // Step 2: Split the strings into lists of substrings
    DECLARE list tt1, tt2
    tt1 = SPLIT t1 by whitespace
    tt2 = SPLIT t2 by whitespace
    
    // Step 3: Initialize counter for differences
    DECLARE integer res
    res = 0 
    
    // Step 4: Compare the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        DECLARE integer a, b
        a = CONVERT tt1[index] to integer
        b = CONVERT tt2[index] to integer
        
        // Step 5: Check for differences
        IF a is NOT equal to b THEN
            INCREMENT res by 1
            
    // Step 6: Determine the final result 
    IF res is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
        
END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Main execution block
IF __name__ is "main" THEN
    CALL doMain()
```

### Assumptions:
- The input strings `t1` and `t2` each contain at least three whitespace-separated values.
- The values in `t1` and `t2` can be safely converted to integers without causing errors.
- The comparison checks are binary (only checking equality). 

### Key Components:
- **Input Handling**: The process of obtaining user input.
- **String Splitting**: Splitting strings into lists.
- **Looping**: Iterating over the first three elements for comparison.
- **Conditionals**: Evaluating the number of differences and concluding with a result.
