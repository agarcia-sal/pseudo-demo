Here is the pseudocode that represents the underlying logic of the provided code clearly and understandably:

```plaintext
FUNCTION main()
    // Step 1: Get two lines of input from the user
    SET firstString TO userInput()
    SET secondString TO userInput()

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstList TO splitString(firstString)
    SET secondList TO splitString(secondString)

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter to track differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Step 4: Compare the numbers in each list
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        SET firstNumber TO convertToInteger(firstList[index])
        SET secondNumber TO convertToInteger(secondList[index])
        
        // Step 5: Check if the numbers are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 

    // Step 6: Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"

// Start the program by calling the main function
CALL main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts with getting two input strings from the user.
2. **String Splitting**: It converts each input string into a list of substrings, separating the values based on spaces.
3. **Initialization**: A counter is initialized to track how many positions have different values between the two lists.
4. **Comparison Loop**: It iteratively compares the first three elements of both lists, updating the counter if a difference is found.
5. **Output Decision**: After completing the comparisons, it checks if the count of differences is less than 3 and prints the corresponding result ("YES" or "NO").
