**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Main Function:**
   - Start main function

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Accept first input string from user and store it as `firstInput`
   - Accept second input string from user and store it as `secondInput`

3. **Split Inputs:**
   - Split `firstInput` into a list of strings and store it in `firstList`
   - Split `secondInput` into a list of strings and store it in `secondList`

4. **Initialize Difference Counter:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0

5. **Compare Corresponding Elements:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the element at the current index in `firstList` to an integer and store it in `firstValue`
     - Convert the element at the current index in `secondList` to an integer and store it in `secondValue`
     - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1

6. **Determine Output:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES"
   - Else:
     - Print "NO"

7. **Execute Main Function:**
   - If script is executed as the main program, call the main function
