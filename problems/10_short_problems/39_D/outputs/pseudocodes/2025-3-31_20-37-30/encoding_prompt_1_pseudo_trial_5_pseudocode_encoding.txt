**Pseudocode:**

1. Define a function named `doMain`.

2. Read input for the first sequence of values and store it in a variable named `input1`.

3. Read input for the second sequence of values and store it in a variable named `input2`.

4. Split `input1` into a list of values and store it in a variable named `values1`.

5. Split `input2` into a list of values and store it in a variable named `values2`.

6. Initialize a counter variable `differenceCount` to 0.

7. For each index `i` from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
   - Convert the value at `values1` at index `i` to an integer and store it in a variable `value1`.
   - Convert the value at `values2` at index `i` to an integer and store it in a variable `value2`.
   - If `value1` is not equal to `value2`, increment `differenceCount` by 1.

8. If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
   - Print "YES".
9. Else:
   - Print "NO".

10. If the script is executed directly, call the `doMain` function to initiate the process.
