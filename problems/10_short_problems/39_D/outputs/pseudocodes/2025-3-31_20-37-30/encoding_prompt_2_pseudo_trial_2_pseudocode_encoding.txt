**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Define the main function: `doMain`.**

3. **Get user input:**
   - Read the first input line and store it as `firstInput`.
   - Read the second input line and store it as `secondInput`.

4. **Split the inputs into lists:**
   - Split `firstInput` by spaces and store the resulting list as `firstList`.
   - Split `secondInput` by spaces and store the resulting list as `secondList`.

5. **Initialize a counter:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to zero. This will track how many elements differ between the two lists.

6. **Compare corresponding elements from the two lists:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the element from `firstList` at the current index to an integer and store it as `firstValue`.
     - Convert the element from `secondList` at the current index to an integer and store it as `secondValue`.
     - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`, increase `differenceCount` by one.

7. **Determine the result based on the count of differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

8. **Execute the main function if the program is run as the main module.**

9. **End the program.**
