### Explanations:
- **main function**: Contains the core logic of the program.
- **readInput()**: Represents a function that reads a line of input from the user.
- **splitString()**: A function that splits a string into a list of substrings based on spaces.
- **convertToInteger()**: Converts a string representation of a number into an integer.
- **differenceCount**: Counts the number of elements that differ between the two lists.
- **Loop and conditionals**: Clearly describes the operations in a structured format, making the flow of data and logic easy to follow.
