**Purpose:**  
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical values and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main:
    // Step 1: Accept user input
    PROMPT user to enter three numbers separated by spaces and store as input1
    PROMPT user to enter three numbers separated by spaces and store as input2

    // Step 2: Split the inputs into individual numbers
    SPLIT input1 into list numbers1
    SPLIT input2 into list numbers2

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount to 0

    // Step 4: Compare the corresponding values in both lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2:
        SET value1 to numbers1[index]
        SET value2 to numbers2[index]

        // Step 5: Check if the numbers differ
        IF value1 is NOT equal to value2 THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // Step 6: Determine the output based on differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"

END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Call the main function to execute the program
CALL main()
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The program prompts the user for two sets of three numbers.
- Each set is split into individual numbers for comparison.
- A counter tracks the number of differences.
- Finally, it checks if the count of differences is less than three to determine whether to output "YES" or "NO". 

This pseudocode simplifies the logic of the original code while making it accessible to readers unfamiliar with programming specifics.
