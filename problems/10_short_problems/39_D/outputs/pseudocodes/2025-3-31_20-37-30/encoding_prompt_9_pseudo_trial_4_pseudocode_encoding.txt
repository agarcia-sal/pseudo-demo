**Purpose:** This program determines if two sets of three integers differ by fewer than three values, indicating a level of similarity.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Receive input for the first set of integers
    DISPLAY "Enter the first set of integers:"
    SET firstSet TO user input

    // Step 2: Receive input for the second set of integers
    DISPLAY "Enter the second set of integers:"
    SET secondSet TO user input

    // Step 3: Split the input into individual integers
    SET firstSetList TO split firstSet into a list of strings
    SET secondSetList TO split secondSet into a list of strings

    // Step 4: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Step 5: Compare corresponding integers in both sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current string values to integers
        SET firstValue TO convert firstSetList[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondSetList[index] to integer
        
        // Step 6: Check if the integers are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // Step 7: Determine if the two sets are considered similar
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        DISPLAY "YES"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "NO"
END FUNCTION

// Step 8: Execute the main function when the script runs
CALL main
```

**Explanation of Input and Output:**
- **Input:** The program requests two sets of three integers each from the user.
- **Output:** It prints "YES" if the sets differ by fewer than three values, otherwise it prints "NO". 

This pseudocode is structured to be easily understood while maintaining the integrity of the algorithm's logic and operations.
