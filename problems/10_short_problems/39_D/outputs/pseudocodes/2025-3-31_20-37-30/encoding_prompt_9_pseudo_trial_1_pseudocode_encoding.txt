**Purpose**: The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three values and determine if they differ by fewer than three values.

**Pseudocode**:

```
START

FUNCTION main
    // Get input from the user
    DISPLAY "Enter the first set of values:"
    SET firstInput TO user input
    DISPLAY "Enter the second set of values:"
    SET secondInput TO user input
    
    // Split the input into lists of values
    SET firstValues TO split firstInput into a list
    SET secondValues TO split secondInput into a list
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through the values in both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current values from string to integer
        SET firstValue TO convert firstValues[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondValues[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        DISPLAY "YES"
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "NO"
    END IF
    
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL main

END
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Input and Output**: The program asks the user for two inputs (sets of three values) and then outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison.
2. **Control Structures**: It employs a loop to iterate through the values, comparing each corresponding pair and a conditional statement to determine the output based on the computed differences.
3. **Variable Descriptions**: Varied values are clearly labeled, indicating their role at each step (e.g., `firstInput`, `differenceCount`, etc.). 
4. **Simplified Operations**: The logic is segmented into understandable parts, making it accessible to readers familiar with basic programming concepts without detailed syntax knowledge.
