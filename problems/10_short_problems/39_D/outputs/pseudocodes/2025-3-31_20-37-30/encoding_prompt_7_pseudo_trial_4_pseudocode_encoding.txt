### Context Explanation:
1. **Input/Output**: The program reads two lines of input from the user, where each line contains three integers. The output is either "YES" or "NO" based on the number of differences between the corresponding integers of the two input lines.
  
2. **Key Logic**: It counts the differences between corresponding integers in the two sets of inputs. If fewer than three integers are different, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". 

3. **Control Structures**: The logic prominently uses a `FOR` loop to iterate through the first three elements and an `IF` statement to check for differences. The structure is kept straightforward to aid understanding.
