Here's the pseudocode that describes the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of three values
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    INITIALIZE firstValues AS firstInput.split()
    INITIALIZE secondValues AS secondInput.split()
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS 0
    
    // Loop through the first three values to compare both sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the values from string to integer for comparison
        INITIALIZE firstValue AS integer(firstValues[index])
        INITIALIZE secondValue AS integer(secondValues[index])
        
        // Check if the current values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference count if they are not the same
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine the output based on the number of differences found
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
IF this script is being run as the main program THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode Logic:
1. **Input Handling:** The function reads two strings of input, each containing three values.
2. **Data Processing:** It splits these strings into lists of values.
3. **Difference Calculation:** It compares corresponding values from both lists and counts how many values are different.
4. **Output Decision:** Based on the count of differences, it outputs "YES" if fewer than three values differ, or "NO" otherwise.
5. **Main Execution:** The last part of the pseudocode ensures that `main()` is called only if the script is run directly, which mimics the behavior of the original Python code.
