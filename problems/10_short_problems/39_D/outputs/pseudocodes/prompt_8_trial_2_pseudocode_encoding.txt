### Purpose
The primary goal of the code is to compare two sets of numerical values input by the user and determine if they are sufficiently similar based on a specific criterion.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
FUNCTION main
    // Read two lines of input from the user, representing two sets of numbers
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of individual number strings
    SPLIT firstSet INTO list firstValues
    SPLIT secondSet INTO list secondValues

    // Initialize a counter to keep track of differing values
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three values of each set
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string values to integers for comparison
        SET firstValue TO convert firstValues[index] TO integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondValues[index] TO integer
        
        // Check if the values from both sets are not equal
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        
    // After comparing all values, check how many differences were found
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        // If differences are fewer than 3, print 'YES'
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        // If 3 or more differences, print 'NO'
        OUTPUT "NO"

// Execute the main function if this code is run directly
IF this script is run directly THEN
    CALL main
```

### Comments for Clarity
- The function `main` gathers two inputs, splits them into lists of strings, and iteratively compares the first three values in each list.
- A counter `differenceCount` accumulates how many values differ between the two sets.
- If fewer than three differences are found, the output is "YES"; otherwise, the output is "NO".
