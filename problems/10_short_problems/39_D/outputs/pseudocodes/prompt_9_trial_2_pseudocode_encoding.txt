**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to compare three values from two separate sets of inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three, the output will be "YES", otherwise "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Main Process**
   
2. **Receive Inputs:**
   - Read a line of input and store it in a variable called `inputSet1`
   - Read a second line of input and store it in a variable called `inputSet2`
   
3. **Split Inputs into Separate Values:**
   - Split `inputSet1` into a list called `valuesSet1`
   - Split `inputSet2` into a list called `valuesSet2`

4. **Initialize a Difference Counter:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0

5. **Compare Corresponding Values:**
   - For each index (0 to 2 inclusive):
     - Convert the value at the current index in `valuesSet1` to an integer and store it in `value1`
     - Convert the value at the current index in `valuesSet2` to an integer and store it in `value2`
     - If `value1` is not equal to `value2`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1

6. **Determine Output Based on Differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO"

7. **End of Process**

**Input and Output:**
- **Input:** The function receives two lines of input, each containing three space-separated numbers.
- **Output:** The function outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on the number of differing positions between the two inputs.

This pseudocode provides a clear and coherent overview of the original program's logic while avoiding technical jargon and maintaining a focus on the algorithm's structure and flow.
