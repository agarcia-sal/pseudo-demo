### Summary of Logic:
1. Two inputs are received, each containing three numbers.
2. The numbers are split into separate values for comparison.
3. A count of how many values differ between the two sets is maintained.
4. The program checks this difference count: if it is less than three, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
