### Explanation:
1. **Purpose:** The code compares two sets of three integer inputs and determines if the number of differences between them is less than three.
2. **Input/Output:** It reads two lines of input and outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison.
3. **Control Structures:** The pseudocode clearly outlines the loop for comparison and the conditional statements for output.
4. **High-Level Abstraction:** The code is abstracted without delving into specific implementation details like data types or functions from libraries.
