**Purpose:** The main goal of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three components. If they have fewer than three differences, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION compareThreeNumbers():
    // Read two lines of input
    SET inputLine1 to user input
    SET inputLine2 to user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET list1 to split inputLine1 into parts
    SET list2 to split inputLine2 into parts
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount to 0 
    
    // Loop through the three parts in the lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO:
        // Convert the current string from each list to an integer
        SET numberFromList1 to convert list1[index] to integer
        SET numberFromList2 to convert list2[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF numberFromList1 is NOT equal to numberFromList2 THEN:
            // Increase the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
            
    // After checking all three numbers, determine the output
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN:
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO"

// Call the main function to execute the logic
CALL compareThreeNumbers()
```

**Explanation of Key Operations:**

1. **Input Handling:** The program takes two lines of input from the user, each containing three space-separated numbers.
2. **Splitting Input:** It splits each line into a list of strings for further processing.
3. **Counting Differences:** A loop iterates through each number in the two lists, converting strings to integers and comparing them. A counter tracks how many numbers differ between the two lists.
4. **Conditional Output:** After checking all three numbers, a conditional statement checks if the differences are less than three to determine whether to output "YES" or "NO". 

**Additional Comments:**
- The variable names are chosen to be descriptive, reflecting their contents and purposes.
- The pseudocode maintains clarity and should be understandable by someone without a programming background.
