### Context Explanation:
- **Purpose:** The function determines how similar two input lines of numbers are by comparing corresponding elements and counting differences.
- **Input and Output:** The function expects two lines of numeric inputs (each consisting of three integers) and outputs "YES" if fewer than three integers differ, or "NO" if three or more integers differ.
- **Control Structures:** The pseudocode uses a `FOR` loop to iterate through elements and an `IF` statement to conditionally increment the difference counter or print results based on the count.
- **Summary of Logic:** The program compares numbers from two user inputs and assesses their degree of similarity based on the number of discrepancies.
