Hereâ€™s a structured pseudocode representation based on the provided Python code. This pseudocode captures the intent, logic, and flow without adhering strictly to programming syntax.

```plaintext
FUNCTION main
    // Get input from the user
    SET firstInput AS READ input from user
    SET secondInput AS READ input from user
    
    // Split inputs into lists of strings
    SET firstList AS SPLIT firstInput into a list of strings
    SET secondList AS SPLIT secondInput into a list of strings
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount AS 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string values to integers
        SET firstValue AS CONVERT firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondValue AS CONVERT secondList[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the values at the same index are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the counter if values are different
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute main function when the script is run
CALL main
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition:** The pseudocode begins with a `FUNCTION main` declaration to signify the start of the main process.
2. **Input Handling:** It reads two inputs from the user and processes them into lists.
3. **Difference Counting Logic:** A loop iterates through the first three elements of both lists, comparing the integers. A counter is maintained to track how many indices differ.
4. **Conditional Output:** After counting, it checks if the number of differences is less than three and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
5. **Execution Trigger:** The script calls the `main` function to start the execution when run.

This structure retains the essence of the original logic while being accessible to someone unfamiliar with the programming language used.
