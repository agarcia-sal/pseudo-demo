**Pseudocode:**

```
Function Main()
    // Read the first line of input, which represents a list of three integers
    Input firstInput
    // Read the second line of input, which represents another list of three integers
    Input secondInput
    
    // Split both inputs into lists of strings
    Split firstInput into firstList
    Split secondInput into secondList

    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    Initialize differenceCount to 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    For each index from 0 to 2 do
        // Convert the string values to integers
        Set firstValue to Convert firstList[index] to Integer
        Set secondValue to Convert secondList[index] to Integer
        
        // Check if the integers are different
        If firstValue is not equal to secondValue then
            // Increment the counter if they are different
            Increment differenceCount by 1 

    // After the loop, evaluate the number of differences
    If differenceCount is less than 3 then
        // If there are fewer than three differences, print "YES"
        Print "YES"
    Else
        // If there are three or more differences, print "NO"
        Print "NO"

// Execute the main function if the script is being run directly
If Main is called then
    Call Main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- This pseudocode defines a main function that reads two lines of inputs, each containing three integers.
- It splits these inputs into lists and counts how many integers differ between the two lists.
- If fewer than three integers differ, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". 
- The pseudocode is structured to clearly reflect the program logic with descriptive names and a clean control flow.
