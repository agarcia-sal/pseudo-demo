**Purpose Summary**: The program compares two sets of three numerical values inputted by the user and determines if the sets differ by fewer than three values. If they differ by at least one but fewer than three, it outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

---

**Pseudocode**:

```
Function main
    // Read input values from the user
    SET firstInput = get user input as a string
    SET secondInput = get user input as a string

    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    SET firstList = split firstInput into a list of strings
    SET secondList = split secondInput into a list of strings

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount = 0 

    // Loop through the first three values of each list
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string values to integers for comparison
        SET firstValue = convert firstList[index] to an integer
        SET secondValue = convert secondList[index] to an integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END Function

// Main execution starts here
CALL main
```

**Explanation of Key Elements**:

- **Input Handling**: The program starts by taking two separate inputs from the user, both expected to contain three numerical values.
  
- **Data Processing**: The inputs are split into lists for individual value comparison.

- **Comparison Logic**: A loop iterates through the values, comparing corresponding elements of both lists. It counts how many of these comparisons yield different results.

- **Conditional Output**: Finally, the program evaluates the count of differences. If the count is less than three, it outputs "YES", indicating that there are some similarities between the two lists; otherwise, it outputs "NO". 

This pseudocode is structured to be understandable without needing to know the specific syntax of any programming language.
