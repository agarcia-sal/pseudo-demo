**Pseudocode:**

```
Function Main
    // Read two lines of input with integer values
    Input firstInput
    Input secondInput

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    Split firstInput into list firstList
    Split secondInput into list secondList

    // Initialize a counter for differing elements
    Set differenceCount to 0

    // Iterate over the first three elements of both lists
    For index from 0 to 2 do
        // Convert the current elements of both lists from strings to integers
        Set firstValue to Convert firstList[index] to integer
        Set secondValue to Convert secondList[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the current elements from both lists are different
        If firstValue is not equal to secondValue then
            // Increment the difference counter
            Increment differenceCount by 1

    // Determine if the count of differences is less than 3
    If differenceCount is less than 3 then
        Output "YES"
    Else
        Output "NO"

// Start the program by calling the Main function
Call Main
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading two sets of input, which are expected to be space-separated integers.

2. **Splitting Input**: It splits these input strings into lists for easier comparison.

3. **Difference Counting**: A counter is initialized to track how many positions have differing values between the two lists.

4. **Loop Over Elements**: It loops through the first three elements of both lists, compares them, and increments the counter whenever a difference is found.

5. **Final Check and Output**: After the loop, it checks if the count of differences is less than three and outputs "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

This structure ensures that the pseudocode is understandable regardless of the reader's familiarity with programming languages.
