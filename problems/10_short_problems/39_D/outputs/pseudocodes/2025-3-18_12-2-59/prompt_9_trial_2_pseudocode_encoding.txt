**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numbers and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Main Program**
   - Define a function called `MainProgram`

2. **Input Handling**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first set of three numbers and store this input as the first set.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second set of three numbers and store this input as the second set.

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Split the first set of numbers into a list called `FirstSet`.
   - Split the second set of numbers into a list called `SecondSet`.

4. **Initialize a Counter**
   - Create a variable called `differenceCount` and set it to 0. This will count how many numbers differ between the two sets.

5. **Comparison Loop**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the three numbers):
     - Convert the number at the current index in `FirstSet` to an integer and store it in a variable called `numberFromFirst`.
     - Convert the number at the current index in `SecondSet` to an integer and store it in a variable called `numberFromSecond`.
     - If `numberFromFirst` is not equal to `numberFromSecond`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Decision Making**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES" (indicating that the two sets differ in fewer than three positions).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating that the two sets differ in three or more positions).

7. **Execute the Main Program**
   - If this script is being run directly, call the `MainProgram` function to start the program.
