### Explanation:
- **doMain function**: Handles the core logic of reading inputs, processing data, and outputting the result.
- **Input Handling**: Reads user input directly and splits it for processing.
- **Loop Structure**: Uses a loop to compare each pair of scores from the two inputs.
- **Count Tracking**: A counter is used to track how many scores are different.
- **Final Decision**: Outputs a result based on the count of differing scores, clearly distinguishing between two possible outcomes ("YES" or "NO").
