Here's the high-level pseudocode that translates the provided Python code while adhering to the specified guidelines:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of values
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet

    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    INITIALIZE list1 AS firstSet.split()
    INITIALIZE list2 AS secondSet.split()

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current element from each list to an integer
        INITIALIZE value1 AS INTEGER(list1[index])
        INITIALIZE value2 AS INTEGER(list2[index])
        
        // Check if the two values are different
        IF value1 IS NOT equal to value2 THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // If fewer than 3 differences, print "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Otherwise, print "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function if the script is run as the main program
IF this script is executed AS the main program THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Context & Complexity
- **Input/Output:** The program expects two strings of space-separated integers as input, each containing three integers. It outputs either "YES" or "NO" based on the number of differences between the corresponding integers in the two sets.
- **Logic Explanation:** The loop compares each integer from the two sets. The result is determined by counting how many integers differ. If fewer than three integers differ, the program outputs "YES"; if three or more differ, it outputs "NO."
