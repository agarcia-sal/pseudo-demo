### Purpose
The purpose of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they are similar enough, allowing for a maximum of two differences. If the number of differences is less than three, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Get two lines of input from the user
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine
    
    // Split the input lines into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO list1
    SPLIT secondLine INTO list2
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements of the lists to integers
        SET value1 TO CONVERT list1[index] TO INTEGER
        SET value2 TO CONVERT list2[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the two values are different
        IF value1 IS NOT EQUAL TO value2 THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Check the total count of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // If there are less than three differences, output "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // If there are three or more differences, output "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of Control Structures
1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by gathering two lines of input, which will each contain three numbers.
2. **Splitting Input**: The input lines are split into separate components for individual comparison.
3. **Loop**: A loop iterates over indices 0 through 2, allowing the program to compare the corresponding numbers from both sets.
4. **Conditional Logic**: Inside the loop, it checks if the numbers differ. If they do, it increases the count of differences.
5. **Final Check**: After looping, a condition checks if the count of differences is less than three to decide the output.

### Comments for Clarity
- Comments are provided alongside logical steps to clarify the purpose of each section of the pseudocode, ensuring that readers can easily follow the flow of logic without needing to understand the original programming syntax.
