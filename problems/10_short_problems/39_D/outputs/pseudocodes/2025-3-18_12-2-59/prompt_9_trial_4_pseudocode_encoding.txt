**Purpose:** The program compares two sets of three integer values and determines whether they differ in fewer than three positions.

---

1. **Start the main process:**
   - Begin the program execution.

2. **Receive input:**
   - Read the first line of input, which contains three integers separated by spaces. Call this set of integers "firstSet".
   - Read the second line of input, which also contains three integers separated by spaces. Call this "secondSet".

3. **Split the input into components:**
   - Divide "firstSet" into individual integer values.
   - Divide "secondSet" into individual integer values.

4. **Initialize a counter for differences:**
   - Set a variable "differenceCount" to zero, which will count how many integers differ between the two sets.

5. **Compare corresponding integers:**
   - Loop through each index from 0 to 2 (for the three integer values):
     - Convert the integer from "firstSet" at the current index into a whole number and call it "firstValue".
     - Convert the integer from "secondSet" at the current index into a whole number and call it "secondValue".
     - If "firstValue" is not equal to "secondValue":
       - Increment "differenceCount" by 1.

6. **Evaluate the result:**
   - After all comparisons are done, check if "differenceCount" is less than 3:
     - If it is, output "YES".
     - Otherwise, output "NO".

7. **End the program:**
   - Conclude the execution of the program.

**Formatted Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN Main Process
    READ firstSet from input
    READ secondSet from input

    SPLIT firstSet into individual values
    SPLIT secondSet into individual values

    SET differenceCount to 0

    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        SET firstValue to integer value of firstSet[index]
        SET secondValue to integer value of secondSet[index]
        
        IF firstValue is NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        ENDIF
    END FOR

    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END Main Process
``` 

This pseudocode captures the logic and flow of the original code, making it clear and accessible without relying on any specific programming syntax.
