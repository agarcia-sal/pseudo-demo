FUNCTION Main

    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING

    DECLARE firstList AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE secondList AS LIST OF STRING
    firstList = SPLIT firstInput INTO LIST OF WORDS
    secondList = SPLIT secondInput INTO LIST OF WORDS

IF this file is run as the main program THEN
