### Purpose
The purpose of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if there are fewer than three differences between the two sets. If there are fewer than three differences, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Accept two lines of input from the user
    SET firstInput TO user input
    SET secondInput TO user input

    // Split each input string into a list of numbers
    SET firstList TO split firstInput into components
    SET secondList TO split secondInput into components

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstNumber TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondNumber TO convert secondList[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF firstNumber NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine how many differences were found
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // If fewer than three differences, print "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // If three or more differences, print "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program by calling the Main function
CALL Main
```

### Comments for Clarity
- The `split` function is used to separate the input strings into individual components (numbers).
- The loop iterates through the first three elements from both lists to compare them.
- The difference counter keeps track of how many times the corresponding numbers do not match.
- The final decision is based on whether the count of differences is less than three. 

This pseudocode organizes the logic clearly and highlights its functionality without relying on specific programming language syntax, making it accessible to readers of varying technical backgrounds.
