**Pseudocode for the Given Program:**

1. **Start the Program**

2. **Define Main Function**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first line of input and store it as `firstInput`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second line of input and store it as `secondInput`.
   - Split `firstInput` into a list of strings called `firstValues`.
   - Split `secondInput` into a list of strings called `secondValues`.
   - Initialize a variable `differenceCount` to 0 to keep track of the number of differences.

3. **Loop through the first three elements of the lists**
   - For each index from 0 to 2:
     - Convert the corresponding element in `firstValues` to an integer and store it as `valueFromFirst`.
     - Convert the corresponding element in `secondValues` to an integer and store it as `valueFromSecond`.
     - If `valueFromFirst` is not equal to `valueFromSecond`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1.

4. **Check the number of differences**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

5. **Execute Main Function if the Program is the Entry Point**

6. **End the Program**
