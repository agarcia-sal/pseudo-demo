**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main:
    // Read input values for two sets of data
    INPUT firstString
    INPUT secondString

    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    SPLIT firstString INTO list firstValues
    SPLIT secondString INTO list secondValues

    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Compare the corresponding values in the two lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert the string values to integers
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstValues[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondValues[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the two values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN:
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 

    // Determine if the count of differences warrants a "YES" or "NO"
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN:
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO"

// Execute the main function when the program runs
CALL main
```

**Explanation of Logic:**
1. The program begins by reading two lines of input, each containing a space-separated list of values.
2. It splits these input strings into lists for easy manipulation.
3. A counter is initialized to keep track of the differences between corresponding elements in the two lists.
4. The program iterates over the first three indices, converting the values to integers and comparing them.
5. Each time a difference is found, the counter is incremented.
6. After comparing the values, a final check determines if the number of differences is less than 3; if so, it outputs "YES"; if not, it outputs "NO".
