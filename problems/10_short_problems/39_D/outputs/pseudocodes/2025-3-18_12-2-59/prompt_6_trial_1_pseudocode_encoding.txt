Here is the pseudocode that translates the provided code into a more understandable format:

```
FUNCTION main():
    // Step 1: Get two lines of input from the user
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine
    
    // Step 2: Split the input lines into individual elements
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Step 4: Compare the first three elements from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2:
        // Convert the elements from strings to integers
        SET firstValue TO INTEGER OF firstList[index]
        SET secondValue TO INTEGER OF secondList[index]
        
        // Step 5: Count the number of differences
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
    
    // Step 6: Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"

// Step 7: Run the main function if this file is executed
IF this file is the main file THEN
    CALL main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Declaration**: The `main()` function is defined to encapsulate the functionality.
2. **Input Handling**: The function prompts the user to input two lines which contain space-separated values.
3. **Splitting Input**: The inputs are split into lists of strings for easy processing.
4. **Initialization**: A counter `differenceCount` is initialized to zero to track how many values differ between the two lists.
5. **Loop and Comparison**: A loop iterates over the first three indices of the lists, comparing corresponding values and counting how many do not match.
6. **Conditional Output**: After comparing values, it checks the count of differences and outputs "YES" if fewer than three differences are found, otherwise it outputs "NO".
7. **Execution Trigger**: The pseudocode includes a check to ensure the `main()` function is called only when the script runs as the main program. 

This format makes it clear what the code is doing, the steps involved in the logic, and how control is transferred within the program.
