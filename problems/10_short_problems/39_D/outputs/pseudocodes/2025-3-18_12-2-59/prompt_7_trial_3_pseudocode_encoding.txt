### Explanation:
1. **Purpose:** The overall goal of this code is to compare two sequences of numbers (expected to have exactly three integers each) and determine if they differ in less than three positions.
  
2. **Meaningful Names:** The variables and functions have been named descriptively to enhance readability.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** The pseudocode maintains a high-level overview without detailing specific programming syntax or low-level operations.

4. **Control Structures:** Clear descriptions of loops and conditionals are provided.

5. **Input and Output:** The inputs are defined as user inputs collected as strings, and the outputs are clearly indicated as "YES" or "NO".

6. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode follows a clear structure with functions and logical blocks.

7. **Natural Language:** The actions and descriptions are framed in simple language.

8. **Clarity Review:** The final pseudocode is easily understandable for users with differing levels of programming experience.

9. **Context for Complexity:** The comparison loop is explained simply with an increment of a counter for differences.

10. **Final Output Expectations:** The printed output is directly linked to the logic of comparing the sequences.
