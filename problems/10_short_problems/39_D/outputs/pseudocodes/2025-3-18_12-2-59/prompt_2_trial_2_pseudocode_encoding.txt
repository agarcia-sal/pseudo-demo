**Pseudocode:**

Begin the main process

    // Receive input from the user
    Get the first line of input and store it as firstInput
    Get the second line of input and store it as secondInput

    // Split the input lines into individual elements
    Split firstInput into a list called firstList
    Split secondInput into a list called secondList

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    Set differenceCount to 0 

    // Compare each corresponding element in the two lists
    For each index from 0 to 2:
        Set valueA to the integer representation of the element at index in firstList
        Set valueB to the integer representation of the element at index in secondList

        // Check if the values are different
        If valueA is not equal to valueB then:
            Increment differenceCount by 1 

    // Determine the output based on the number of differences
    If differenceCount is less than 3 then:
        Output "YES"
    Otherwise:
        Output "NO"

End the main process
