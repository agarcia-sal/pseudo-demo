Here is the high-level pseudocode that accurately reflects the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Get input from the user for two sets of data
    SET firstInput TO USER INPUT
    SET secondInput TO USER INPUT
    
    // Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList
    
    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Compare the first three elements from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO INTEGER of firstList[index]
        SET secondValue TO INTEGER of secondList[index]
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Decide output based on the number of differences found
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** The program takes two user inputs, which are expected to be space-separated strings.
2. **Splitting Input:** Each input is split into a list of string representations of the numbers.
3. **Counting Differences:** The program compares the first three elements from both lists, converting them into integers to see if they differ.
4. **Condition Evaluation:** Based on the number of differences, it prints "YES" if there are fewer than three differences and "NO" if there are three or more.
5. **Program Structure:** The `main` function encapsulates all operations, and execution starts from there. 

This pseudocode captures the original logic while remaining accessible to readers with different levels of programming knowledge.
