**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of three integers
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    firstList = SPLIT firstSet INTO LIST
    secondList = SPLIT secondSet INTO LIST
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    differenceCount = 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string elements to integers
        firstValue = CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        secondValue = CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the two values are different
        IF firstValue NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // If the number of differences is less than three, output "YES"
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Otherwise, output "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function if the script is run as the main program
IF script IS RUN AS MAIN THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

**Explanation of the logic:**
1. The program reads two sets of three integers from the user, each on a separate line.
2. It splits these input lines into lists of strings.
3. The program compares corresponding elements from both lists.
4. It counts how many of the elements differ.
5. If fewer than 3 elements differ, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
