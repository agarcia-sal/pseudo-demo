**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they are similar enough to warrant a "YES" response (fewer than three mismatches), or otherwise a "NO" response.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read the first line of input. This line contains three space-separated numbers. Store these in a variable named `firstSet`.
   - Read the second line of input. This line also contains three space-separated numbers. Store these in a variable named `secondSet`.

2. **Split Input into Individual Numbers:**
   - Break apart `firstSet` into three individual numbers and store them in a list named `firstList`.
   - Break apart `secondSet` into three individual numbers and store them in a list named `secondList`.

3. **Initialize a Mismatch Counter:**
   - Create a variable named `mismatchCount` and set it to 0. This will count how many numbers do not match between the two sets.

4. **Compare Corresponding Numbers:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the number from `firstList` at the current index to an integer and store it in a variable named `firstNumber`.
     - Convert the number from `secondList` at the current index to an integer and store it in a variable named `secondNumber`.
     - If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`, increase `mismatchCount` by 1.

5. **Determine and Output the Result:**
   - If `mismatchCount` is less than 3, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

6. **Program Execution:**
   - Start the program by calling the function that contains the above logic.

**Final Note:** This pseudocode outlines the basic logic and structure needed to compare two sets of three numbers, making it clear and comprehensible for anyone reviewing it.
