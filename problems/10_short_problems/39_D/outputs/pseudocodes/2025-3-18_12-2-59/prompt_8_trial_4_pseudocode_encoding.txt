**Objective:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numeric inputs and determine whether they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
Function MainFunction:
    // Accept two input strings from the user
    userInput1 = Get user input for first set of numbers
    userInput2 = Get user input for second set of numbers
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    listOfNumbers1 = Split userInput1 into individual numbers
    listOfNumbers2 = Split userInput2 into individual numbers
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    differenceCount = 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three numbers in both lists
    For each index from 0 to 2:
        // Convert the current number from both lists to integers
        number1 = Convert listOfNumbers1 at this index to an integer
        number2 = Convert listOfNumbers2 at this index to an integer
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        If number1 is not equal to number2:
            // Increment the difference counter
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
    
    // Check the total number of differences
    If differenceCount is less than 3:
        Print "YES" // Output indicating fewer than 3 differences
    Else:
        Print "NO" // Output indicating 3 or more differences

// Start the program by calling the main function
If this script is executed directly:
    Call MainFunction
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs:** The program takes two strings of numbers as input. Each string should contain three numbers separated by spaces.
2. **Processing:** It splits each input string into a list of individual numbers and then compares the numbers at each corresponding position. 
3. **Counting Differences:** A counter tracks how many positions contain different numbers.
4. **Output:** If the counter of differences is less than three, the program prints "YES". If there are three or more differences, it prints "NO". 

This structure is designed to be easily understood, focusing on the logical flow and key operations without requiring knowledge of specific programming syntax.
