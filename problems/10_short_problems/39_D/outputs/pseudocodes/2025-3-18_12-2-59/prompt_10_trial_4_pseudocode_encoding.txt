Here is the pseudocode based on the provided Python code, following the structured language concepts as outlined:

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE tt1 AS ARRAY OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS ARRAY OF STRING
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO 0
    DECLARE a AS INTEGER
    DECLARE b AS INTEGER

    SET t1 TO USER INPUT
    SET t2 TO USER INPUT
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 INTO ARRAY USING SPACE AS DELIMITER
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 INTO ARRAY USING SPACE AS DELIMITER

    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        SET a TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        SET b TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
    END FOR

    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

IF PROGRAM IS RUN AS MAIN THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

### Explanations of Guided Steps:

1. **Identify the Main Components:**
   - Functions (`doMain`), input operations, loops (for loop), conditionals (if statements), and basic arithmetic operations are identified and represented in structured pseudocode.

2. **Break Down Complex Elements:** 
   - The code inputs are clearly separated into the variables. The comparison operations and the count of mismatches are expressed stepwise.

3. **State Assumptions Clearly:** 
   - It is assumed that inputs are well-formed, and that the input strings contain three space-separated integers.

4. **Maintain Clarity and Readability:**
   - Each variable is named meaningfully (e.g., `t1`, `t2`, `res`, `a`, `b`) to enhance understanding.

5. **Choose Appropriate Verb Tenses:** 
   - The actions are written in present tense ("SET", "PRINT", "CALL") for clarity and a consistent reading flow.
