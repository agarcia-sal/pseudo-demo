Here is the pseudocode translation of the given Python code following the guided steps.

```plaintext
FUNCTION doMain
    // Step 1: Read two input strings
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 INTO words
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 INTO words

    // Initialize result counter
    SET res TO 0 

    // Step 3: Compare corresponding elements in both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        SET a TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO integer
        SET b TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO integer
        
        // Step 4: Count mismatches
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Determine result based on count of mismatches
    IF res < 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Main execution block
IF this script is being run as the main program THEN
    CALL doMain
END IF
```

### Assumptions:
- The `input` function retrieves strings from the user.
- The `split()` function divides the input string into a list of words based on spaces.
- It is assumed that both input strings contain exactly three space-separated integers.
- The function checks for mismatches between integers and counts them to determine the final output.
