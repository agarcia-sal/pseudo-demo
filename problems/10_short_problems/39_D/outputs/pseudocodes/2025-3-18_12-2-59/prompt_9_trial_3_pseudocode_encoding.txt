**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program**
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first set of three numbers and store it as 'firstSet'.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second set of three numbers and store it as 'secondSet'.
3. **Split Input:**
   - Separate 'firstSet' into individual numbers and store them in a list called 'firstNumbers'.
   - Separate 'secondSet' into individual numbers and store them in a list called 'secondNumbers'.
4. **Initialize Difference Counter:**
   - Set a variable named 'differenceCount' to 0.
5. **Compare Numbers:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the first three numbers):
     - Convert the number from 'firstNumbers' and 'secondNumbers' at the same index to integers and store them as 'firstNumber' and 'secondNumber'.
     - If 'firstNumber' is not equal to 'secondNumber':
       - Increment 'differenceCount' by 1.
6. **Determine Output:**
   - If 'differenceCount' is less than 3:
     - Display the message "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Display the message "NO".
7. **End the Program**

**Input:** Two sets of three numbers provided by the user.

**Output:** A message indicating whether the two sets differ in fewer than three positions ("YES" or "NO").
