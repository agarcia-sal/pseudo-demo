**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine
    
    // Split the input lines into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstValues
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondValues
    
    // Initialize a counter to track the number of different values
    SET differencesCount TO 0 
    
    // Iterate through the first three values from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert current values from strings to integers
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstValues[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondValues[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differencesCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differencesCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program execution
CALL main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins with reading two lines of input that represent two sets of values.
2. **Splitting Values**: The input lines are split into lists of individual values for comparison.
3. **Counting Differences**: It initializes a counter and iterates through both lists, converting each value from string to integer and checking for differences.
4. **Decision Making**: After counting the differences, it checks if the count is less than 3 to determine the final output.
5. **Output**: The output is either "YES" or "NO" based on the result of the comparison. 

This structured approach provides clarity and summarizes the key operations without the specific syntax of any programming language.
