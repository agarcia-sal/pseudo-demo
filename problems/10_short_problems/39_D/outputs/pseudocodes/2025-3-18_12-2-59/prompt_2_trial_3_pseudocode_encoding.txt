**Pseudocode**

1. Begin Program

2. Define a function named "doMain"
   
3. Prompt the user to input the first string of numbers and store it in "firstInput"
   
4. Prompt the user to input the second string of numbers and store it in "secondInput"
   
5. Split "firstInput" into a list of strings called "firstList"
   
6. Split "secondInput" into a list of strings called "secondList"
   
7. Initialize a variable "differenceCount" to zero to keep track of how many numbers differ between the two lists

8. For each index, starting from 0 to 2 (representing the first three elements):
   - Convert the item at the current index in "firstList" to an integer and store it in "firstNumber"
   - Convert the item at the current index in "secondList" to an integer and store it in "secondNumber"
   - If "firstNumber" is not equal to "secondNumber":
       - Increment "differenceCount" by one

9. After evaluating all three indices, check if "differenceCount" is less than 3:
   - If true, output "YES" (indicating that there are fewer than 3 differences)
   - If false, output "NO" (indicating that there are 3 or more differences)

10. End function "doMain"

11. If the program is being run as the main program, call the function "doMain"

12. End Program
