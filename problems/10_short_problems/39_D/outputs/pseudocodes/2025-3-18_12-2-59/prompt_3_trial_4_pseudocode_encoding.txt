Hereâ€™s the pseudocode translation based on the provided Python code snippet:

```
FUNCTION MainProcess
    // Step 1: Read two lines of input from the user
    SET firstInput TO USER_INPUT
    SET secondInput TO USER_INPUT
    
    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of values
    SET firstValues TO SPLIT firstInput INTO LIST
    SET secondValues TO SPLIT secondInput INTO LIST
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter to keep track of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Step 4: Compare the first three corresponding values from both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2
        SET valueA TO CONVERT firstValues[index] TO INTEGER
        SET valueB TO CONVERT secondValues[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Step 5: If the values are different, increment the difference counter
        IF valueA IS NOT EQUAL TO valueB THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 6: Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
IF this_script_is_main THEN
    CALL MainProcess
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading input from the user for two separate strings.
2. **Data Processing**: These strings are split into lists, which will allow for easier access to individual values for comparison.
3. **Comparison Logic**: A loop is set up to iterate through the first three elements of each list, converting them to integers for comparison.
4. **Counting Differences**: A simple conditional checks if elements differ, updating a counter accordingly.
5. **Output Decision**: Finally, based on the count of differences, the function prints either "YES" or "NO". 
6. **Structured Execution**: The main execution block indicates where the function is called if the script is executed as the main program. 

This pseudocode structure makes it easier for someone to understand how the program operates without needing to know specific programming syntax.
