Here's the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION compareThreeInputs()
    // Read input from the user
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList
    
    // Initialize a variable to count the differing elements
    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstNumber AS integer value of firstList[index]
        SET secondNumber AS integer value of secondList[index]
        
        // Check if the two numbers are different
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber THEN
            // Increment the counter for differences
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check if the count of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution block
IF program is run as main THEN
    CALL compareThreeInputs()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Purpose**: The function `compareThreeInputs` compares two sets of three integer inputs and determines if they differ in fewer than three positions.
  
2. **Input and Output**: It takes two lines of input, each containing three integers separated by spaces. It outputs "YES" if the two lists differ in fewer than three elements, otherwise, it outputs "NO".

3. **Control Structures**: The pseudocode clearly represents loops and conditionals. The loop iterates three times, each time comparing corresponding elements from the two input lists.

4. **Variable Naming**: Descriptive names like `firstInput`, `secondInput`, `firstList`, `secondList`, and `differenceCount` are used for clarity.

5. **High-Level Abstraction**: More complex operations like string splitting and list manipulation are mentioned in general terms, keeping the focus on the logical flow of the program.
