**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION MainProcedure
    // Read two space-separated strings from input
    INPUT firstString
    INPUT secondString

    // Split the strings into lists of substrings
    SPLIT firstString INTO list firstNumbers
    SPLIT secondString INTO list secondNumbers

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstNumber TO CONVERT firstNumbers[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondNumber TO CONVERT secondNumbers[index] TO INTEGER

        // Check if the numbers differ
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
CALL MainProcedure
```

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

1. The procedure begins by reading two separate strings from the input.
2. These strings are then split into lists of substrings based on spaces.
3. A counter `differenceCount` is initialized to keep track of how many positions have different values between the two lists.
4. The algorithm loops through the first three positions of both lists, converting the corresponding string elements into integers.
5. During the loop, it checks if the integers at the current index differ; if they do, it increments the `differenceCount`.
6. After exiting the loop, the program evaluates whether the `differenceCount` is less than 3.
7. Based on this evaluation, it prints "YES" if there are fewer than three differences, otherwise it prints "NO". 
8. Finally, the main procedure is called to execute the algorithm.
