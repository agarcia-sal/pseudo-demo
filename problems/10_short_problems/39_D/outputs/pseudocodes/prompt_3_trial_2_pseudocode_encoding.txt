Here is the pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided code snippet in a structured and understandable way:

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Step 1: Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine
    
    // Step 2: Split each input line into a list of strings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO list firstValues
    SPLIT secondLine INTO list secondValues
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a variable to count differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Step 4: Compare corresponding values in the two lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        // Convert current values to integers
        SET valueFromFirstList TO integer value of firstValues[index]
        SET valueFromSecondList TO integer value of secondValues[index]
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF valueFromFirstList NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondList THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    // Step 5: Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Main program execution
CALL Main
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. The pseudocode starts with defining the main function where the computation occurs.
2. It reads two lines of input from the user, splits them into lists of string representations of numbers.
3. It initializes a counter to keep track of how many corresponding values are different between the two input lists.
4. A loop iterates over indices 0 to 2 to compare the integer values from both lists. If they are not equal, the counter is incremented.
5. Finally, a conditional check determines if the counter of differences is less than 3, printing "YES" or "NO" based on that evaluation.
6. The pseudocode ends with a call to the Main function to run the program. 

This format focuses on the overall logic and flow, making it easier to understand the program's purpose without getting bogged down in specific programming syntax.
