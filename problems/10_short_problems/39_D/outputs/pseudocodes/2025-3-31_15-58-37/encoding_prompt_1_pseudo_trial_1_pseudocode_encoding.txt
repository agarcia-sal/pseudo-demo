### Pseudocode

**Function Definition: Main Process**
1. Define the main function `doMain`.

**Input Handling:**
2. Read the first line of input and store it in variable `inputString1`.
3. Read the second line of input and store it in variable `inputString2`.
4. Split `inputString1` into a list of strings called `numberList1`.
5. Split `inputString2` into a list of strings called `numberList2`.

**Initialize a Counter:**
6. Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0 to keep track of differences.

**Comparison Logic:**
7. For each index `i` from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
    a. Convert the element at index `i` in `numberList1` to an integer and store it in `valueA`.
    b. Convert the element at index `i` in `numberList2` to an integer and store it in `valueB`.
    c. If `valueA` is not equal to `valueB`, increment `differenceCount` by 1.

**Output Decision:**
8. If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
    a. Print "YES".
9. Otherwise:
    a. Print "NO".

**Program Execution:**
10. If this script is the main program being executed, call the `doMain` function to run the main process.
