**Pseudocode**

1. **Function Definition: Main Function**
   - Define a function called `doMain`

2. **Input Handling: Read Values**
   - Read a line of input and store it in `firstInput`
   - Read a second line of input and store it in `secondInput`
   - Split `firstInput` into a list of values called `firstList`
   - Split `secondInput` into a list of values called `secondList`

3. **Initialize Counter: Count Differences**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0

4. **Comparison Loop: Check Values**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the element at this index in `firstList` into an integer and store it in `valueA`
     - Convert the element at this index in `secondList` into an integer and store it in `valueB`
     - If `valueA` is not equal to `valueB`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1

5. **Decision Making: Output Result**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES"
   - Else:
     - Print "NO"

6. **Execution Block: Run the Main Function**
   - If this script is being executed directly, call the `doMain` function.
