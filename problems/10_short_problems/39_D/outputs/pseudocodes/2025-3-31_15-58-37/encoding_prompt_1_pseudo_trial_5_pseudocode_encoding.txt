**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read first input string representing a series of values
    FIRST_INPUT = read input from user
    // Read second input string representing another series of values
    SECOND_INPUT = read input from user

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    FIRST_VALUES = split FIRST_INPUT into list
    SECOND_VALUES = split SECOND_INPUT into list

    // Initialize a variable to count differences
    DIFFERENCE_COUNT = 0 

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers for comparison
        FIRST_VALUE = convert FIRST_VALUES[index] to integer
        SECOND_VALUE = convert SECOND_VALUES[index] to integer
        
        // Compare the current elements from both lists
        IF FIRST_VALUE is NOT EQUAL TO SECOND_VALUE THEN
            // Increment the difference count
            DIFFERENCE_COUNT = DIFFERENCE_COUNT + 1 
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Check if the count of differences is less than 3
    IF DIFFERENCE_COUNT is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // Print "YES" if there are less than 3 differences
        print "YES"
    ELSE
        // Print "NO" if there are 3 or more differences
        print "NO"
    ENDIF

END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL main()
``` 

### Description:
1. The program starts by reading two lines of input from the user, each containing a series of values separated by spaces.
2. The inputs are split into lists for individual access.
3. A loop iterates through the first three values of both lists, comparing them one by one.
4. A counter is incremented for each pair of values that are different.
5. After the comparisons, if the count of differences is less than three, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
