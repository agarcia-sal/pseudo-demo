**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main():
    // Read two input strings from the user
    INPUT firstInputString
    INPUT secondInputString
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    SPLIT firstInputString INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInputString INTO secondList
    
    // Initialize a variable to count the number of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert the string values to integers for comparison
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN:
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
    
    // Determine the output based on the count of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN:
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO"
    
// Execute the main function if this script is run directly
IF this script is executed THEN:
    CALL main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by reading two lines of input, representing two sets of three values each.
2. **String Splitting:** Each input string is split into a list based on white space.
3. **Difference Counting:** A loop iterates through the first three elements of the two lists to count the number of discrepancies between corresponding values.
4. **Output Decision:** If the number of differences is less than three, it prints "YES". If there are three or more differences, it prints "NO".
