Here is the pseudocode translation based on the provided steps:

```
FUNCTION doMain
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO 0

    // Get user input
    t1 = INPUT("Enter first set of values: ")
    t2 = INPUT("Enter second set of values: ")

    // Split input strings into lists of strings
    tt1 = SPLIT(t1)    // Assuming tt1 now contains three values as strings
    tt2 = SPLIT(t2)    // Assuming tt2 now contains three values as strings

    // Compare corresponding elements from both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        a = CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        b = CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            res = res + 1 

    // Output result based on the number of differences
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
END FUNCTION

// Main execution point
CALL doMain()
```

### Key Components:
1. **Input and Output**: Program accepts two lines of input and outputs "YES" or "NO" based on comparisons.
2. **Loop and Conditionals**: Contains a loop to compare three pairs of values and a conditional to decide on the output.
3. **Data Conversion**: Converts string inputs to integers for comparison.
  
### Assumptions:
- The input strings for `t1` and `t2` are valid and contain exactly three space-separated integers.
- The conversion from string to integer is successful without errors.

### Clarity and Readability:
- Each operation is spelled out clearly to enhance understanding.
- Descriptive names are used (`res`, `a`, `b`, `tt1`, `tt2`) to represent their purpose without jargon. 

### Verb Tenses:
- Present tense is used consistently to articulate the actions being taken in the pseudocode.
