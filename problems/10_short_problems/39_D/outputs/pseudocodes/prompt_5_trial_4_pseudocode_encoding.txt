**Purpose Summary:**  
The purpose of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical values and determine whether they differ in fewer than three positions. If they do, the program will output "YES"; otherwise, it will output "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
Function Main:
    // Step 1: Accept input from the user for two sets of numbers
    OUTPUT "Enter the first set of three numbers:"
    SET firstInput = Get user input as a string
    OUTPUT "Enter the second set of three numbers:"
    SET secondInput = Get user input as a string

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstSet = Split firstInput into a list of numbers
    SET secondSet = Split secondInput into a list of numbers

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter to track the number of differences
    SET differenceCount = 0 

    // Step 4: Compare each corresponding pair of numbers in the input sets
    FOR each index from 0 to 2:
        SET firstNumber = Convert firstSet[index] to an integer
        SET secondNumber = Convert secondSet[index] to an integer

        // Step 5: Check if the numbers are different
        IF firstNumber is not equal to secondNumber THEN:
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 

    // Step 6: Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN:
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE:
        OUTPUT "NO"

// Step 7: Execute the main function when the program runs
Call Main
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- Each step in the pseudocode is annotated to clarify what the program is doing.
- The use of descriptive names like `differenceCount` and `firstSet` makes it clear what each variable represents.
- The logical flow is easy to follow, outlining input collection, processing, and output in a manner accessible to readers without a programming background.
