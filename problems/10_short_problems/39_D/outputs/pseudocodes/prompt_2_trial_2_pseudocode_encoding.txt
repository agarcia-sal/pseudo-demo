**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program execution.**

2. **Define a function called "doMain".**

3. **Collect input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first string of numbers and store it as "firstString".
   - Prompt the user to enter the second string of numbers and store it as "secondString".

4. **Process the inputs:**
   - Split "firstString" into a list of individual string elements called "firstList".
   - Split "secondString" into a list of individual string elements called "secondList".

5. **Initialize a counter variable named "differenceCount" to zero.**

6. **Compare elements:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the element at the current index in "firstList" to an integer and store it as "firstNumber".
     - Convert the element at the current index in "secondList" to an integer and store it as "secondNumber".
     - If "firstNumber" does not equal "secondNumber":
       - Increment the "differenceCount" by one.

7. **Determine the result:**
   - If "differenceCount" is less than 3:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

8. **Execute the function "doMain" when the program runs.**

9. **End the program execution.**
