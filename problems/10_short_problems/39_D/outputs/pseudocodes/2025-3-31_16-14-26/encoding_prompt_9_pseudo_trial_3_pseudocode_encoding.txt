**Purpose:**  
The goal of this program is to compare two sequences of three numeric values and determine whether they differ in less than three positions. If they do, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program Execution**
   
2. **Define Main Function: doMain**
   - Prompt the user for input and read two lines containing numeric values.
   - Split the first line of input into a list of values called firstSequence.
   - Split the second line of input into a list of values called secondSequence.
   - Initialize a variable called differenceCount to 0.

3. **Compare Corresponding Values in the Two Sequences**
   - For each index from 0 to 2:
     - Convert the value from firstSequence at the current index to an integer and store it in a variable named firstValue.
     - Convert the value from secondSequence at the current index to an integer and store it in a variable named secondValue.
     - If firstValue is not equal to secondValue:
       - Increment differenceCount by 1.

4. **Determine Output Based on Differences Count**
   - If differenceCount is less than 3:
     - Print "YES"
   - Else:
     - Print "NO"

5. **Execute Main Function When the Program Starts**

**End of Pseudocode**

In this pseudocode, we've simplified the logic, using clear variable names and straightforward descriptions to ensure the programâ€™s intent is easily understood by those not familiar with specific programming syntax. The control flow, including loops and conditionals, is expressed in plain language for clarity.
