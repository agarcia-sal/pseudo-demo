Here is the translated pseudocode based on the provided code, following the guided steps:

```
FUNCTION doMain

    // Step 1: Input values
    DECLARE variable t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE variable t2 AS STRING
    t1 = READ input from user
    t2 = READ input from user

    // Step 2: Split input strings into lists
    DECLARE variable tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    tt1 = SPLIT t1 by whitespace
    DECLARE variable tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    tt2 = SPLIT t2 by whitespace

    // Step 3: Initialize result counter
    DECLARE variable res AS INTEGER
    res = 0

    // Step 4: Compare elements in the lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE variable a AS INTEGER
        a = CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        DECLARE variable b AS INTEGER
        b = CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER

        // Step 5: Increment result if values differ
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            res = res + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Print result based on comparison count
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Start execution
CALL doMain
```

### Assumptions:
- Input strings `t1` and `t2` are assumed to contain three space-separated numeric values.
- Results of comparisons are stored in the integer variable `res`, which counts how many values differ between the two lists.
- The comparison is considering only the first three elements of the split lists.
