Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that captures the intent and structure of the provided Python code in a clear and understandable manner:

```
FUNCTION Main:
    // Read input values from the user
    PROMPT the user for the first input string and assign to variable firstInput
    PROMPT the user for the second input string and assign to variable secondInput
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of components
    SPLIT firstInput into a list called firstList
    SPLIT secondInput into a list called secondList
    
    // Initialize a variable to count differences
    SET differenceCount to 0
    
    // Compare corresponding elements of both lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2:
        SET valueFromFirstList to convert firstList[index] to an integer
        SET valueFromSecondList to convert secondList[index] to an integer
        
        // Check for differences between the two values
        IF valueFromFirstList is NOT equal to valueFromSecondList:
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
    
    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount is less than 3:
        PRINT "YES" // There are fewer than 3 differences
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO" // There are 3 or more differences

// Execute the main function when the script runs
CALL Main
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode clearly denotes where user inputs are prompted and stored.
2. **List Creation**: It abstracts the splitting of input strings into lists without focusing on specific syntax.
3. **Comparison Logic**: The loop and conditions are explained plainly, showing how differences are counted.
4. **Output Decision**: The final condition checks and outputs clarify the result based on the number of differences counted.

This pseudocode provides a structured overview of what the original Python code accomplishes, making it easy for someone unfamiliar with the specifics to grasp the logic and flow.
