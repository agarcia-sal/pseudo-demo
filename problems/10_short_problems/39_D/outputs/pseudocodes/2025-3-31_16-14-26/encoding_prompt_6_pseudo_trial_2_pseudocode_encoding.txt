### Explanation:
- The pseudocode begins with defining the main function, where the program execution starts.
- It reads two lines of input from the user, which are expected to be space-separated values.
- Each input string is split into a list of individual components (words).
- A counter is initialized to keep track of how many values differ between the two input lists.
- It iterates through the first three elements of the lists, checking whether the corresponding values are different. If they are, it increments the counter.
- Finally, based on the number of differences counted, it prints "YES" if there are fewer than three differences, or "NO" otherwise.
