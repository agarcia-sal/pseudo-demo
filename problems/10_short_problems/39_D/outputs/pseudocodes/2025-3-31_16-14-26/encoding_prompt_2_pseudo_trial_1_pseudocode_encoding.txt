**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define the main procedure called `doMain`.**

2. **Prompt for User Input:**
   - Read a line of input from the user and store it as `inputString1`.
   - Read another line of input from the user and store it as `inputString2`.

3. **Process the Input:**
   - Split `inputString1` into a list of strings called `listOfValues1`.
   - Split `inputString2` into a list of strings called `listOfValues2`.

4. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Create a variable called `differenceCount` and set it to 0. This variable will count how many corresponding values in the two lists are different.

5. **Compare Values:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the value at that index in `listOfValues1` to an integer and store it in `valueA`.
     - Convert the value at that index in `listOfValues2` to an integer and store it in `valueB`.
     - If `valueA` is not equal to `valueB`, increment the `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Output the Result:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

7. **Start the Program:**
   - If this script is run as a standalone program, execute the `doMain` procedure.
