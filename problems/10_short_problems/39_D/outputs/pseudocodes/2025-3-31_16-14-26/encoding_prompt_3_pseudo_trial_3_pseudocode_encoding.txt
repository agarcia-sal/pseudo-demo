Here's the structured pseudocode that translates the provided Python code into a more readable format while capturing the underlying logic:

```
FUNCTION Main() 
    // Step 1: Read input from the user
    DECLARE userInput1 AS STRING
    DECLARE userInput2 AS STRING
    userInput1 = Get input from the user
    userInput2 = Get input from the user
    
    // Step 2: Split the inputs into lists of strings
    DECLARE inputList1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE inputList2 AS LIST OF STRING
    inputList1 = Split userInput1 into list of strings
    inputList2 = Split userInput2 into list of strings
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0
    
    // Step 4: Compare the elements of the two lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers for comparison
        DECLARE number1 AS INTEGER
        DECLARE number2 AS INTEGER
        number1 = Convert inputList1[index] to INTEGER
        number2 = Convert inputList2[index] to INTEGER
        
        // Step 5: Check if the numbers are different
        IF number1 IS NOT EQUAL TO number2 THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 6: Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Execute the Main function when the program is run
IF this script is the main program THEN
    CALL Main()
END IF
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: Starts by obtaining two inputs from the user.
2. **Data Splitting**: Converts the string inputs into lists of substrings.
3. **Difference Counting**: A counter is initialized to keep track of differences between the corresponding elements.
4. **Comparison Loop**: Loops through the first three elements, compares their integer values and counts any discrepancies.
5. **Conditional Output**: Finally, it checks if the count of differences is less than 3 and prints “YES” or “NO” accordingly.
6. **Program Execution**: The main function executes only if the script is run directly. 

This pseudocode format helps clarify the logic of the program while maintaining a high-level description that doesn't get bogged down in specific programming language syntax.
