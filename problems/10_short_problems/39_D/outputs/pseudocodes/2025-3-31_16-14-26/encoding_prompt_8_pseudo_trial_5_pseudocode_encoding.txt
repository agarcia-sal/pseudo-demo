**Objective:** The purpose of this code is to compare two sets of three numbers to determine how many of them are different and output a response based on the count of differences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION MainProcedure:
    // Get input from the user
    SET firstInput AS USER INPUT
    SET secondInput AS USER INPUT
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstList TO SPLIT firstInput INTO INDIVIDUAL NUMBERS
    SET secondList TO SPLIT secondInput INTO INDIVIDUAL NUMBERS
    
    // Initialize counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Compare the numbers in both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert the current element from both lists to integers
        SET numberFromFirstList AS CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET numberFromSecondList AS CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF numberFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO numberFromSecondList THEN:
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 // Increase the difference count if they are not equal
            
    // Determine the final output based on the count of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN:
        PRINT "YES" // Less than 3 differences means they are considered similar
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO" // 3 or more differences means they are considered different

// Start executing the main procedure when the program runs
CALL MainProcedure
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- This pseudocode begins by defining a procedure that encompasses the whole program logic.
- It describes how the program receives two inputs, which are expected to be strings of numbers.
- The inputs are split into lists of numbers so they can be compared.
- A loop runs three times to compare the corresponding numbers from each input.
- A counter tracks how many numbers differ between the two inputs.
- Finally, based on the count of differences, it prints "YES" if there are fewer than three differences, and "NO" otherwise.
