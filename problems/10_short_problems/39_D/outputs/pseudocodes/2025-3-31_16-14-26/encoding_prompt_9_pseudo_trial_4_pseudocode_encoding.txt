**Purpose:** The program compares two sets of three numeric values and determines if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program**
   
2. **Receive Input**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first set of three numbers and store it in a variable named `firstSet`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second set of three numbers and store it in a variable named `secondSet`.

3. **Split Input into Individual Numbers**
   - Split `firstSet` into a list called `firstList`.
   - Split `secondSet` into a list called `secondList`.

4. **Initialize a Counter for Differences**
   - Set a variable called `differenceCount` to 0 to count how many numbers are different between the two sets.

5. **Compare Each Number in the Sets**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the position of the numbers):
     - Convert the number in `firstList` at the current index to an integer and call it `firstNumber`.
     - Convert the number in `secondList` at the current index to an integer and call it `secondNumber`.
     - If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`:
       - Increase `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Determine the Result**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO"

7. **End the Program** 

**Input/Output Explanation:**
- **Input:** Two lines of space-separated numbers, each containing three integers.
- **Output:** A single line stating "YES" if fewer than three numbers are different, or "NO" if three or more numbers are different. 

This pseudocode effectively outlines the logic and flow of the original code while being accessible and easy to understand.
