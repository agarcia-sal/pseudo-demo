### Summary of Purpose:
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical values entered by the user. It evaluates how many values differ between the two sets and determines if they are similar enough to output a positive response.

### Pseudocode:

```
FUNCTION MainProcedure
    // Get the first set of numbers from the user
    SET firstNumberSet TO USER INPUT AS STRING

    // Get the second set of numbers from the user
    SET secondNumberSet TO USER INPUT AS STRING

    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstNumberList TO SPLIT firstNumberSet INTO LIST
    SET secondNumberList TO SPLIT secondNumberSet INTO LIST

    // Initialize a counter for the number of differing values
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through indices from 0 to 2 (for the three number pairs)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2
        // Convert the current values from strings to integers
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstNumberList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondNumberList[index] TO INTEGER

        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increase the count of differences
            INCREASE differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // Print "YES" if they are similar enough
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Print "NO" if they differ significantly
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program by calling the MainProcedure
CALL MainProcedure
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Input Handling:** The program asks the user for two sets of three numbers and processes them as strings. They are then split into lists for comparison.
  
2. **Comparison Logic:** It loops through each number in the two lists, checking for differences and counting how many values do not match.

3. **Output Decision:** At the end of the comparisons, the program checks the count of differences. If fewer than three differences are found, it outputs "YES", otherwise it outputs "NO".

### Comments for Clarity:
- The loop iterates a fixed number of times (three), corresponding to the three values being compared.
- The comparison uses basic conditional logic (if statements) to determine equality and count the differences.
- The program assumes valid input; it does not include error handling for non-numeric input or incorrect quantities.
