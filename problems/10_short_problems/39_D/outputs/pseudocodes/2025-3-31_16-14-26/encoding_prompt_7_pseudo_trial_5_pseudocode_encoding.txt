Here is the high-level pseudocode that reflects the logic and operations of the provided Python code. 

```
FUNCTION MainFunction()
    // Prompt the user for input
    PROMPT user for first string input and store as firstInput
    PROMPT user for second string input and store as secondInput

    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    SPLIT firstInput into list firstList
    SPLIT secondInput into list secondList
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount as 0 

    // Compare corresponding elements in the two lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        CONVERT firstList[index] to integer and store as firstValue
        CONVERT secondList[index] to integer and store as secondValue

        // Check if the values differ
        IF firstValue is not equal to secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Initiates the MainFunction when the script is executed
IF script is executed as main THEN
    CALL MainFunction()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode

1. **Input/Output Overview:** The function reads two strings from the user, splits them into components, and compares those components based on their numerical values.

2. **Comparison Logic:** It counts how many of the corresponding components between the two input strings differ. If fewer than three components differ, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode is structured using clear functions and logical flow statements, making it easy to follow and understand.

4. **Control Structures:** The looping and conditional checks are articulated simply, ensuring that the logic is transparent to readers who might be unfamiliar with the original coding language. 

This pseudocode effectively summarizes the code's operations while maintaining clarity and coherence.
