Here's a structured pseudocode representation of the given Python code that captures its intent and logic without getting buried in specific syntax.

```plaintext
Function Main()
    // Step 1: Read input from the user
    Input string t1
    Input string t2

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of words
    Create list tt1 by splitting t1
    Create list tt2 by splitting t2

    // Step 3: Initialize a variable to count differences
    Set differenceCount to 0 

    // Step 4: Compare corresponding elements in both lists
    For each index from 0 to 2 do
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        Set valueA to the integer value of tt1 at index
        Set valueB to the integer value of tt2 at index

        // Step 5: Check if the values are different
        If valueA is not equal to valueB then
            Increment differenceCount by 1 

    // Step 6: Determine and print if differences are less than 3
    If differenceCount is less than 3 then
        Print "YES"
    Else
        Print "NO"

End Function

// Entry point of the program
If this script is run as the main program then
    Call Main()
```

### Explanation:
1. The pseudocode begins with defining a main function to organize the logic.
2. It clearly states the input process, splitting the inputs into manageable lists.
3. A counter is initialized to track how many values are different between the two lists.
4. A loop iterates over the indices to compare corresponding values, incrementing the difference counter as needed.
5. Finally, the code evaluates the count of differences to print a "YES" or "NO" based on the specified condition. 

This structured approach allows readers unfamiliar with programming to follow the logic without getting bogged down in syntax.
