**Purpose**: The objective of this code is to compare two sets of three integer values and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they do differ in fewer than three spots, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read the first line of input, which contains a set of three integers
    firstInputLine = read input from user
    // Read the second line of input, which contains another set of three integers
    secondInputLine = read input from user

    // Split the input lines into individual string components
    firstSet = split firstInputLine into list of strings
    secondSet = split secondInputLine into list of strings

    // Initialize a counter to track the number of mismatches
    mismatchCount = 0 

    // Iterate through each index from 0 to 2 (for three comparisons)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string values to integers for comparison
        firstValue = convert firstSet[index] to integer
        secondValue = convert secondSet[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the two values are different
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            // Increment the mismatch counter
            mismatchCount = mismatchCount + 1 
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Check if the number of mismatches is less than 3
    IF mismatchCount is less than 3 THEN
        // If there are fewer than 3 mismatches, print "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // If there are 3 or more mismatches, print "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Start execution of the program by calling the main function
CALL main()
```

### Annotations:
- The program expects two lines of input, each containing three integer values.
- Each integer is compared one by one, and the program counts how many of these integer pairs are different.
- The comparisons and resulting output are clearly defined to maintain simplicity and clarity for readers who may not be familiar with programming languages.
