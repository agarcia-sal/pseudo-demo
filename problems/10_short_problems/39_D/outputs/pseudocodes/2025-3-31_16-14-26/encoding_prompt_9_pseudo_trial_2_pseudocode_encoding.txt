**Purpose:** The program compares two sets of three numbers and determines if the number of differences between them is less than three.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Receive input
    PROMPT user for first set of three numbers
    STORE user input in variable firstSet
    PROMPT user for second set of three numbers
    STORE user input in variable secondSet

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists
    SPLIT firstSet into a list called numbersFromFirstSet
    SPLIT secondSet into a list called numbersFromSecondSet

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount to 0

    // Step 4: Compare the numbers in both sets
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        SET numberFromFirst to convert numbersFromFirstSet[index] to an integer
        SET numberFromSecond to convert numbersFromSecondSet[index] to an integer

        // Step 5: Check if the numbers are different
        IF numberFromFirst is NOT equal to numberFromSecond THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // Step 6: Evaluate the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"

END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Execute the main function
CALL main
```

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Step:** The program prompts the user to input two sets of three numbers, storing them as separate variables.
2. **Data Splitting:** The input strings are split into lists, separating the individual numbers.
3. **Difference Counting:** A counter is initialized to keep track of how many numbers differ between the two sets.
4. **Comparison Loop:** The program iterates through the indices of the lists and compares the numbers, updating the counter for each difference found.
5. **Condition Check:** After comparing, the program checks if the count of differences is less than three and prints the corresponding result. 
6. **Execution:** The main function is called to run the algorithm. 

This pseudocode maintains the core logic of the original program while using clear and descriptive language to enhance understanding.
