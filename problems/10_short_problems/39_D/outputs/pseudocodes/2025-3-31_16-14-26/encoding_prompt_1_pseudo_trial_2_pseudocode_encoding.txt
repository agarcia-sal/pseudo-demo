**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Step 1: Get input
    READ firstInput
    READ secondInput

    // Step 2: Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList USING spaces
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList USING spaces

    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Step 3: Compare corresponding elements of the two lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        SET valueFromFirstList TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO integer
        SET valueFromSecondList TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF valueFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondList THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1

    // Step 4: Check the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"

// Invoke the main function when running the program
CALL main()
```

**Explanation:**
- The pseudocode begins by defining a `main` function that encapsulates the logic.
- It reads input values and splits them into lists of strings based on spaces.
- A counter named `differenceCount` is initialized to keep track of the number of differing entries between the two input lists.
- A loop iterates through the indices of the lists, comparing corresponding elements and updating the counter if they are different.
- Finally, an if condition checks whether the count of differences is less than three, printing "YES" if true and "NO" otherwise. 
- The `main` function is called to execute the program.
