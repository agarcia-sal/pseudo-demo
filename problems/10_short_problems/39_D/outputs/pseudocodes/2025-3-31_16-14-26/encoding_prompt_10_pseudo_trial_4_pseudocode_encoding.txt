Here is a clear and concise pseudocode representation of the provided Python code, following the guided steps:

```plaintext
FUNCTION doMain()

    // Step 1: Read input
    SET t1 AS USER INPUT
    SET t2 AS USER INPUT

    // Step 2: Split the inputs into lists
    SET tt1 AS SPLIT(t1 INTO LIST)
    SET tt2 AS SPLIT(t2 INTO LIST)

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter to track differences
    SET res TO 0

    // Step 4: Compare elements in both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        SET a TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        SET b TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
        
        // If the elements are not equal, increment the counter
        IF a NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Determine and output the result based on the counter
    IF res LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Program Execution Start
CALL doMain()
```

### Key Components Identified:
1. **Input Handling:** Reads two lines of input.
2. **Data Splitting:** Splits the input strings into two lists.
3. **Loop:** Iterates through the first three elements of both lists to compare.
4. **Conditional Logic:** Checks if the values are different and updates a counter.
5. **Output Decision:** Based on the counter, prints "YES" if fewer than 3 differences exist, otherwise prints "NO".

### Assumptions:
- Inputs `t1` and `t2` contain at least three space-separated integers.
- The input integers can be converted from string representation to integer without error.

### Clarity and Readability:
- The pseudocode uses plain language to describe actions and logical structures, making it easily understandable without using specific programming syntax.
