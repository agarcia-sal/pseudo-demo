**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**
2. **Define a function named `doMain`:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first set of values and store the input as `firstSet`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second set of values and store the input as `secondSet`.
   - Split `firstSet` into a list of values called `firstList`.
   - Split `secondSet` into a list of values called `secondList`.
   - Initialize a counter called `differenceCount` to zero.
   
3. **Loop through each index from 0 to 2:**
   - Convert the value at the current index in `firstList` to an integer and store it as `firstValue`.
   - Convert the value at the current index in `secondList` to an integer and store it as `secondValue`.
   - **If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`:**
     - Increment the `differenceCount` by one.

4. **After the loop:**
   - **If `differenceCount` is less than 3:**
     - Output "YES".
   - **Otherwise:**
     - Output "NO".

5. **Execute the `doMain` function when the program starts.**
6. **End the program.**

**Input Requirements:**
- Two separate inputs from the user, each containing three space-separated values.

**Output Requirements:**
- A message indicating "YES" if there are less than three differences between the two sets of values; otherwise, a message indicating "NO".
