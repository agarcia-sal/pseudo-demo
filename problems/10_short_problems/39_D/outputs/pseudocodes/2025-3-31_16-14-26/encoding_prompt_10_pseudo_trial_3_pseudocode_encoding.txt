Here is the pseudocode for the provided Python code, following the guided steps:

```
BEGIN

    FUNCTION doMain()
        DECLARE t1 AS STRING
        DECLARE t2 AS STRING
        DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRINGS
        DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRINGS
        DECLARE res AS INTEGER
        SET res = 0
        
        // Get inputs from user
        t1 = INPUT("Enter first line of input:")
        t2 = INPUT("Enter second line of input:")
        
        // Split input strings into lists
        tt1 = SPLIT(t1)
        tt2 = SPLIT(t2)
        
        // Loop through the first 3 elements of both input lists
        FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
            DECLARE a AS INTEGER
            DECLARE b AS INTEGER
            a = CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
            b = CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
            
            // Compare elements and update result counter
            IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
                INCREMENT res BY 1
            END IF
        END FOR
        
        // Check result to determine output
        IF res < 3 THEN
            PRINT "YES"
        ELSE 
            PRINT "NO"
        END IF
        
    END FUNCTION

    // Call the main function to execute the program
    CALL doMain()

END
```

### Explanation of Components:
1. **Function and Inputs**: The `doMain` function handles user input and initializes necessary variables.
2. **Data Splitting**: The input strings are split into lists for easier manipulation.
3. **Loop**: A for-loop iterates over the first three elements, comparing values from both lists while counting differences.
4. **Conditional Statement**: An if-statement checks counter value to determine the appropriate response ("YES" or "NO").
5. **Calls and Execution**: The function is called only when the script is executed.

### Assumptions:
- Input values are expected to be valid integers.
- The input strings will contain at least three space-separated values.
- Comparisons are made based on integer values converted from string inputs.
