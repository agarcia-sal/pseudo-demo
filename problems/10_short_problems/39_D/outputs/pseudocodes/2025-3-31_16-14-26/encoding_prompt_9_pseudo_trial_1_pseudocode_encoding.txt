**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three integers input by the user and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Begin Main Function**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first set of three integers as a string.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second set of three integers as a string.

3. **Split Input into Individual Numbers:**
   - Split the first input string into a list of integers called `firstSet`.
   - Split the second input string into a list of integers called `secondSet`.

4. **Initialize Difference Counter:**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0.

5. **Compare Corresponding Items:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the three integers):
     - Retrieve the integer from `firstSet` and assign it to a variable `firstNumber`.
     - Retrieve the integer from `secondSet` and assign it to a variable `secondNumber`.
     - If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`:
       - Increase `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Determine Result Based on Differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

7. **End Main Function**

**Execution Trigger:**
- When the script is run, invoke the main function to start the program. 

**Input and Output Explanation:**
- **Input:** Two strings containing three space-separated integers each, provided by the user.
- **Output:** A response of "YES" or "NO" based on whether the two sets of integers differ in fewer than three positions.
