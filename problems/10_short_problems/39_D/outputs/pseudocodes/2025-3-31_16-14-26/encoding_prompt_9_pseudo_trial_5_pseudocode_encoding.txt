**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ by less than three positions. If they do, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Declare Function doMain**
    - **Receive First Input:** Store the first line of input as `firstInput`
    - **Receive Second Input:** Store the second line of input as `secondInput`
    
3. **Split Inputs into Lists:**
    - Create a list `firstList` by splitting `firstInput` into individual elements
    - Create a list `secondList` by splitting `secondInput` into individual elements

4. **Initialize a Counter for Differences:**
    - Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0

5. **Loop through the Range from 0 to 2 (for three comparisons):**
    - For each index `i` in the range:
        - Convert the elements at index `i` of `firstList` and `secondList` to integers, naming them `valueFromFirst` and `valueFromSecond`
        - **If the two values are not equal:**
            - Increment `differenceCount` by 1

6. **Check the Number of Differences:**
    - **If `differenceCount` is less than 3:**
        - Output "YES"
    - **Else:**
        - Output "NO"

7. **Execute the Function doMain when the Program Starts:**

8. **End Program** 

This pseudocode maintains the logic of comparing the two inputs while abstracting away specific syntax and programming constructs, making it easier for a diverse audience to understand the algorithmâ€™s intention and flow.
