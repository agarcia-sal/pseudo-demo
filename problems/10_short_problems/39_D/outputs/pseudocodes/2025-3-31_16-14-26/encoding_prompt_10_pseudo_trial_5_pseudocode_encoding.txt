**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Read two lines of input
    READ firstInput
    READ secondInput

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstList TO SPLIT firstInput
    SET secondList TO SPLIT secondInput

    // Step 3: Initialize a variable to count differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER

        // Step 5: Check for differences between the elements
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Check the count of differences to decide output
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

IF THIS FILE IS EXECUTED AS MAIN THEN
    CALL main
END IF
```

### Assumptions:
- The input consists of two lines of space-separated integers.
- Each line is expected to contain exactly three integers.
- The integers can be successfully converted from string format to integer format.
