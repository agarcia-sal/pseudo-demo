FUNCTION doMain()
    // Step 1: Read two lines of input and store them in variables
    PROMPT user for first input string
    STORE input string as t1
    PROMPT user for second input string
    STORE input string as t2

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    SPLIT t1 into a list called tt1
    SPLIT t2 into a list called tt2

    // Step 3: Initialize a variable to count differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount to 0 

    // Step 4: Compare elements of the two lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        // Convert the substring to an integer for comparison
        SET a to integer value of tt1[index]
        SET b to integer value of tt2[index]

        // Step 5: Increment the count if the numbers are not equal
        IF a is not equal to b THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Determine output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Main execution block
IF the script is executed as the main program THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF

### Explanation of Complexity
- This pseudocode captures the flow of comparing two sets of three integers, determining if they differ in fewer than three positions. The logic is straightforward: it processes inputs, counts differences, and prints the appropriate response based on that count. The use of a loop for comparison simplifies understanding of how each number is evaluated. If readers are unfamiliar with string manipulation or input handling, additional context can be provided as needed.
