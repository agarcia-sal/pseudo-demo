**Pseudocode:**

Start of the program

1. **Define a function named 'doMain'**:
   - Prompt the user to input a string for the first set of values, storing it as 'firstInput'.
   - Prompt the user to input a string for the second set of values, storing it as 'secondInput'.
   - Split 'firstInput' into a list of individual string values called 'firstValues'.
   - Split 'secondInput' into a list of individual string values called 'secondValues'.
   - Initialize a variable 'differenceCount' to 0 which will count how many values differ between the two sets.

2. **Repeat the following steps for three iterations (loop index from 0 to 2)**:
   - Convert the value at the current index of 'firstValues' into an integer and store it as 'firstValue'.
   - Convert the value at the current index of 'secondValues' into an integer and store it as 'secondValue'.
   - Compare 'firstValue' and 'secondValue':
     - If they are not equal, increase the 'differenceCount' by 1.

3. **After completing the loop**, check the final count of differences:
   - If 'differenceCount' is less than 3, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

End of the function 'doMain'.

4. **If the program is executed as the main program**, call the function 'doMain' to run the logic.

End of the program.
