**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numbers and determine if at least one number is different between them. If there are fewer than three differences, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Get input from the user
    SET firstInput TO user input as a string
    SET secondInput TO user input as a string

    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstList TO split firstInput into separate elements
    SET secondList TO split secondInput into separate elements
    
    // Initialize the difference counter
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert the corresponding elements to integers for comparison
        SET firstNumber TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondNumber TO convert secondList[index] to integer
        
        // If the numbers are not equal, increase the difference counter
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber THEN:
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
            
    // Check the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN:
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO"

END FUNCTION

// Start the program by calling the main function
CALL main()
```

**Key Steps Explained:**

1. **Input Handling:** The program starts by accepting two lines of input from the user that contain three numbers each.

2. **Data Preparation:** Inputs are split into lists for easier comparison.

3. **Comparison Logic:** The program then iterates over the numbers in both lists, comparing them one by one. It counts how many numbers differ between the two sets.

4. **Outcome Decision:** After checking all three numbers, if fewer than three numbers differ, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Comments:** The pseudocode provides a high-level overview of the logic without delving into specific programming language syntax, making it accessible to a broader audience. It clearly indicates the flow of information and decisions based on the comparisons made.
