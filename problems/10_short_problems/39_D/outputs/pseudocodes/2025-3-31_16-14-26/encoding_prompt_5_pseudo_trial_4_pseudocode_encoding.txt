**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to compare two sets of three integer inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they do, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION checkDifferences()

    // Prompt the user to enter the first set of integers
    DISPLAY "Enter the first set of three integers separated by spaces:"
    INPUT firstSet

    // Prompt the user to enter the second set of integers
    DISPLAY "Enter the second set of three integers separated by spaces:"
    INPUT secondSet

    // Split the input strings into separate integer values
    SPLIT firstSet INTO firstArray
    SPLIT secondSet INTO secondArray
    
    // Initialize a counter to track the number of differences
    DIFFERENCE_COUNT = 0 

    // Loop through each index from 0 to 2 (for the three integers)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO

        // Convert the strings at the current index to integers
        FIRST_VALUE = CONVERT firstArray[index] TO INTEGER
        SECOND_VALUE = CONVERT secondArray[index] TO INTEGER

        // Check if the two values differ
        IF FIRST_VALUE IS NOT EQUAL TO SECOND_VALUE THEN
            INCREMENT DIFFERENCE_COUNT BY 1

    // After comparing all integers, check the number of differences
    IF DIFFERENCE_COUNT IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"    // Output "YES" if there are fewer than 3 differences
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"     // Output "NO" if there are 3 or more differences

END FUNCTION

// Call the function to execute the comparisons
CALL checkDifferences()
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The function is designed to handle user input and output.
- It emphasizes clarity by naming variables and operations straightforwardly.
- The pseudocode systematically proceeds through the logic of the original code while abstracting away syntax to focus on the program's purpose and flow.
