**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Main Function**
   
2. **Input Phase:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first sequence of three numbers and store this input in a variable called `firstSequence`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second sequence of three numbers and store this input in a variable called `secondSequence`.

3. **Process Input:**
   - Split `firstSequence` into individual number strings and store them in a list called `firstList`.
   - Split `secondSequence` into individual number strings and store them in a list called `secondList`.

4. **Initialize Difference Counter:**
   - Set a counter variable `differenceCount` to zero. This will track how many numbers are different between the two sequences.

5. **Comparison Loop:**
   - For each position from 0 to 2 (representing the three numbers):
     - Convert the number at the same position in `firstList` to an integer and assign it to `numberFromFirst`.
     - Convert the number at the same position in `secondList` to an integer and assign it to `numberFromSecond`.
     - If `numberFromFirst` is not equal to `numberFromSecond`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Decision-making:**
   - After checking all three numbers:
     - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
       - Print "YES" indicating that the sequences differ in less than three positions.
     - Otherwise:
       - Print "NO" indicating that the sequences differ in three or more positions.

7. **End Main Function** 

**Execution Context:**
- This function begins executing automatically when the program runs. It handles user input, processes the input to compare two sequences of numbers, and outputs a conclusion based on the comparison.
