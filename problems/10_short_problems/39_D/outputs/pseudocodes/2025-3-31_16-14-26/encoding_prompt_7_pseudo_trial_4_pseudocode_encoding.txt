Here is the high-level pseudocode based on the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION evaluateDifferencesBetweenInputs()
    // Read two input strings representing sequences of numbers
    INPUT firstSequence
    INPUT secondSequence

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstSequence INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondSequence INTO secondList

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of the lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string elements to integers
        SET numberFromFirstList AS INTEGER(firstList[index])
        SET numberFromSecondList AS INTEGER(secondList[index])

        // Check if the two numbers are not equal
        IF numberFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO numberFromSecondList THEN
            // Increment the difference count
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // If the number of differences is less than 3, output "YES"
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Otherwise, output "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start execution of the program
IF currentModule IS "__main__" THEN
    CALL evaluateDifferencesBetweenInputs()
END IF
```

### Explanation of Components:

1. **Purpose of the Code:** The code evaluates two sequences of three numbers and counts how many numbers differ between the two sequences. If fewer than three numbers differ, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

2. **Input and Output:**
   - **Input:** Two lines of input, each containing three numbers separated by spaces.
   - **Output:** A single line of output showing either "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison results.

3. **Control Structures:**
   - A `FOR` loop is used to iterate through the first three elements of the lists.
   - An `IF` statement checks each pair of numbers for inequality and increments a counter accordingly.
   - Another `IF` statement determines the final output based on the count of differences.

4. **High-level Abstraction:** The pseudocode summarizes the operations without detailing the underlying syntactical structures or libraries, making it more approachable to a broader audience. 

This structure follows a logical flow and is designed to clearly convey the intentions of the original code.
