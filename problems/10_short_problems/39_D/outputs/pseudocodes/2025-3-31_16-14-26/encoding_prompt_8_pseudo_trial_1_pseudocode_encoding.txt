**Purpose**: The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three integers and determine if they differ by fewer than three values. If they differ in fewer than three positions, the program will output "YES"; otherwise, it will output "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main:
    // Receive two lines of input from the user
    SET firstInput TO user input
    SET secondInput TO user input
    
    // Split each input into a list of strings
    SET firstList TO split firstInput into a list of strings
    SET secondList TO split secondInput into a list of strings
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through each corresponding pair in the two lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2:
        // Convert the string at the current index to an integer for both lists
        SET firstValue TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondList[index] to integer

        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue:
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // After comparing all three values, check the count of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3:
        PRINT "YES" // Output that the values are similar
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO" // Output that the values are different

IF this file is run as the main program:
    CALL main()
```

### Comments/Annotations:
- Input and output operations are clearly indicated.
- The loop iterates exactly three times as we are comparing three values.
- Conditions are clearly defined to assess the differences between the corresponding values from the two lists.
- The program outputs a simple "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison, which is straightforward for understanding results.
