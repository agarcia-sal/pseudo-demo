### Explanation:

1. **Function Declaration**: Starts with defining the main function that performs the logic.
2. **Input Handling**: Describes reading the input strings and splitting them into lists.
3. **Loop Structure**: Clearly outlines the process of comparing elements from both lists.
4. **Conditional Logic**: Describes the decision-making process based on the count of differences.
5. **Outputs**: Clearly states the outputs ("YES" or "NO") based on the comparison results.
6. **Script Execution**: Indicates that the function should be called when the script runs.
