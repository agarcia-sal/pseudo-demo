Below is the high-level pseudocode that represents the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Read two lines of input, each containing three space-separated integers
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList

    // Initialize a variable to count the number of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements from strings to integers
        SET firstValue TO INTEGER(firstList[index])
        SET secondValue TO INTEGER(secondList[index])

        // If the values are not equal, increment the difference counter
        IF firstValue is NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // If the number of differences is less than 3, print "YES"
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Otherwise, print "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function when this script is run directly
IF script is executed directly THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inputs:** The program takes two lines of input, each containing three space-separated integers.
2. **Logic:** It compares the integers in the two lines one by one to count how many values differ.
3. **Output:** If fewer than three integers are different, it outputs "YES"; if not, it outputs "NO".
4. **Control Structures:** A loop iterates over the indices of the integer lists, and conditionals check for equality and determine the output based on the number of differences.
