Here is the pseudocode for the provided Python code, following the guided steps:

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    
    // Step 1: Get input from the user
    t1 = GET user input
    t2 = GET user input
    
    // Step 2: Split input strings into lists
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    tt1 = SPLIT t1 by whitespace
    tt2 = SPLIT t2 by whitespace
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER
    res = 0 
    
    // Step 4: Compare corresponding elements from both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER
        a = CONVERT tt1[x] to INTEGER
        b = CONVERT tt2[x] to INTEGER
        
        // Check if the elements are different
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            res = res + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 5: Determine the outcome based on the number of differences
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution
CALL doMain
```

**Assumptions:**
- The input received will always be valid strings that can be split and converted into integers.
- The input strings will contain exactly three space-separated numbers.
- The program compares only the first three items of each input for differences.

This pseudocode clearly outlines the logic and processes of the original Python code, using structured language concepts and without programming jargon.
