### Purpose:
The primary goal of this program is to compare two sets of three input values and determine whether they differ in fewer than three positions. 

### Pseudocode:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Accept input for the first set of values
    PROMPT "Enter first set of three numbers"
    READ firstSet

    // Accept input for the second set of values
    PROMPT "Enter second set of three numbers"
    READ secondSet

    // Split the input strings into lists of individual numbers
    firstValues = split firstSet into a list
    secondValues = split secondSet into a list

    // Initialize a counter for the number of differences
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Loop through each position to compare the values
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current values from string to integer
        valueFromFirstSet = convert firstValues[index] to integer
        valueFromSecondSet = convert secondValues[index] to integer

        // Check if the values at the current index are different
        IF valueFromFirstSet is NOT equal to valueFromSecondSet THEN
            // Increase the difference counter by one
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the number of differences is less than three
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Call the main function to execute the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of Steps:
1. The program starts by prompting the user to input two sets of three numbers each.
2. It then splits the input into lists for comparison.
3. A loop iterates through each index (0 to 2) to compare the numbers at the corresponding positions in both lists.
4. If the numbers are not the same, a counter for differences is incremented.
5. After all comparisons, the program checks if there are less than three differences and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

This structure keeps the logic clear and easy to follow for anyone reviewing the pseudocode, regardless of their programming background.
