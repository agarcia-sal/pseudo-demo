### Breakdown of Pseudocode Elements:
1. **Function Declaration**: The main functionality is encapsulated within a `main` function.
2. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode clearly indicates the retrieval of input from the user, enhancing understanding of input requirements.
3. **Data Manipulation**: The strings are split into lists, which makes the transition from strings to list elements clear.
4. **Control Structures**:
    - The `FOR` loop iterates over a fixed range, emphasizing the limit of three comparisons.
    - The `IF` statement evaluates conditions for determining differences between numbers.
5. **Output Decision**: The result is printed based on the final condition assessing the count of differences.
6. **Execution Trigger**: At the end of the pseudocode, the main function is called, indicating the start of the program.
