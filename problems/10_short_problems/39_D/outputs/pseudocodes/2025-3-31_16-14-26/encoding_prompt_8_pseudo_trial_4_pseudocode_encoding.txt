**Purpose**: The purpose of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ in less than three positions. If they do, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION mainProcedure:
    // Step 1: Accept two lines of input
    SET firstInput TO read input from user
    SET secondInput TO read input from user

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstList TO split firstInput into a list of strings
    SET secondList TO split secondInput into a list of strings

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter to track differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Step 4: Compare the numbers in both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert current elements to integers for comparison
        SET firstNumber TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondNumber TO convert secondList[index] to integer

        // Check if the numbers are not equal
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber THEN:
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 

    // Step 5: Determine the outcome based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is less than 3 THEN:
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO"

// Execute the main procedure when the program runs
CALL mainProcedure
```

### Comments:
- This pseudocode abstracts the logic of reading inputs, comparing them, and conditionally outputting a result in simple terms.
- It uses descriptive names for functions and variables to enhance clarity.
- Control structures (like loops and conditionals) are expressed in a straightforward manner to make it easy to follow the sequence of operations.
- The comments provide additional context where necessary to ensure understanding, especially for readers who may not be familiar with programming concepts.
