**Pseudocode Representation:**

1. Start the main process.
2. Read a line of input from the user and store it in the variable `inputString1`.
3. Read another line of input from the user and store it in the variable `inputString2`.
4. Split `inputString1` into a list of strings called `tokens1`.
5. Split `inputString2` into a list of strings called `tokens2`.
6. Initialize a counter variable `differenceCount` to zero, which will track the number of differences between the two lists.
7. For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the first three entries of both lists):
    - Convert the current entry in `tokens1` to an integer and store it in `valueFromFirstInput`.
    - Convert the current entry in `tokens2` to an integer and store it in `valueFromSecondInput`.
    - If `valueFromFirstInput` is not equal to `valueFromSecondInput`, increment `differenceCount` by one.
8. After checking all three entries, if `differenceCount` is less than 3:
    - Output "YES" to indicate that there are fewer than three differences.
9. Otherwise, output "NO" to indicate that there are three or more differences.
10. End the process.
