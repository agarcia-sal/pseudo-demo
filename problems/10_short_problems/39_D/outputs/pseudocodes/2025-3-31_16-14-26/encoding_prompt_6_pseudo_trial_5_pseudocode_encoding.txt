FUNCTION main:
    // Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine

    // Split the input lines into separate values
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstValues
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondValues

    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    SET differenceCount = 0 

    // Iterate through the first three values of both inputs
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert the current values from strings to integers
        SET firstValue = CONVERT firstValues[index] TO INTEGER
        SET secondValue = CONVERT secondValues[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN:
            // Increase the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 

    // If there are fewer than three differences, print "YES", otherwise print "NO"
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN:
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO"

// Start the main function if this script is executed
IF this script is executed AS main THEN:
    CALL main()
``` 

**Explanation:**
- The pseudocode defines a main function that processes two inputs.
- It splits these inputs into individual elements for comparison.
- A loop iterates through the first three elements of the inputs, counting how many of them differ.
- Finally, based on the count of differences, it outputs either "YES" or "NO". 
- The algorithm is clear and structured for anyone, even without programming knowledge, to follow.
