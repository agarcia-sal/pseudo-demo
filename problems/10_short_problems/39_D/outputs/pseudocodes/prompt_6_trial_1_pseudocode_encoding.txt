### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **Function Definition**: The main function is defined to encapsulate the logic.
2. **Input Handling**: It reads two lines of input, which are then split into lists for comparison.
3. **Loop and Comparison**: A loop iterates over the first three elements from both lists to compare them. The differences are counted.
4. **Conditional Output**: Based on the count of differences, the program outputs "YES" if there are fewer than three differences and "NO" otherwise. 

This structure aims to give a clear understanding of the operations and decisions made in the logic of the original code.
