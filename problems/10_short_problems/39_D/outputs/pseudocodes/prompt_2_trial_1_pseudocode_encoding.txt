**Pseudocode:**

1. Start the main process.

2. Get input from the user for the first string of numbers and store it as `firstInput`.
   
3. Get input from the user for the second string of numbers and store it as `secondInput`.

4. Split `firstInput` into a list of strings called `firstList`, where each element represents a number.

5. Split `secondInput` into a list of strings called `secondList`, where each element represents a number.

6. Initialize a counter variable named `differenceCount` to zero. This will keep track of how many numbers differ between the two input lists.

7. Repeat the following actions for each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
   a. Convert the number from `firstList` at the current index into an integer and store it in a variable named `firstNumber`.
   b. Convert the number from `secondList` at the current index into an integer and store it in a variable named `secondNumber`.
   c. If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`, increase `differenceCount` by one.

8. After checking all corresponding numbers, evaluate the value of `differenceCount`:
   a. If `differenceCount` is less than 3, print "YES".
   b. Otherwise, print "NO".

9. End the main process.
