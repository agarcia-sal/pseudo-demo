**Pseudocode**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two input strings from the user
    FIRST_STRING = GET_USER_INPUT()
    SECOND_STRING = GET_USER_INPUT()
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    LIST1 = SPLIT_STRING(FIRST_STRING)
    LIST2 = SPLIT_STRING(SECOND_STRING)
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DIFFERENCE_COUNT = 0 
    
    // Compare the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        NUMBER1 = CONVERT_TO_INTEGER(LIST1[index])
        NUMBER2 = CONVERT_TO_INTEGER(LIST2[index])
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF NUMBER1 IS NOT EQUAL TO NUMBER2 THEN
            INCREMENT DIFFERENCE_COUNT BY 1
    
    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF DIFFERENCE_COUNT LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"

// Execute the main function
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of the Logic:
1. The program starts by reading two strings from the user.
2. It then splits these strings into lists of substrings.
3. A counter is initialized to track how many corresponding elements in the two lists are different.
4. A loop iterates through the first three elements of both lists. For each element:
   - Both elements are converted from string to integer.
   - If they are not equal, the counter is increased.
5. After comparing the elements, if the count of differing elements is less than three, "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.
