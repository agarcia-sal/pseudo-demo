**Pseudocode**

```
Define function mainProcedure:

    // Get two strings as input
    Read firstInput from user
    Read secondInput from user

    // Split the input strings into lists based on spaces
    Split firstInput into list firstList
    Split secondInput into list secondList

    Initialize differenceCount to 0

    // Compare each element in the lists
    For each index from 0 to 2:
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        Set firstElement to integer value of firstList[index]
        Set secondElement to integer value of secondList[index]

        // Check if the elements are different
        If firstElement is not equal to secondElement:
            Increment differenceCount by 1

    // Check the number of differences
    If differenceCount is less than 3:
        Print "YES"
    Else:
        Print "NO"

// Execute the mainProcedure function
Call mainProcedure
```

**Explanation:**

- This pseudocode outlines a main procedure that begins by taking two lines of input from the user.
- Each line is split into components and stored in separate lists.
- It then initializes a counter to keep track of how many corresponding elements from the two lists are different.
- Using a loop, it compares the elements of both lists and increments the counter for each difference found.
- Finally, it checks whether there were fewer than three differences and prints "YES" if that is the case or "NO" otherwise.
