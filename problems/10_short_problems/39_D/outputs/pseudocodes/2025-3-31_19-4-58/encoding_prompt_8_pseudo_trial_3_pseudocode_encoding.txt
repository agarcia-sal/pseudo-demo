**Purpose Summary**:  
The primary goal of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ by less than three values. If they do, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    GET inputLine1 FROM user
    GET inputLine2 FROM user
    
    // Split input lines into lists of strings
    SPLIT inputLine1 INTO list1 USING space
    SPLIT inputLine2 INTO list2 USING space
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the corresponding elements to integers
        SET valueA TO convert list1[index] TO integer
        SET valueB TO convert list2[index] TO integer
        
        // Check if the two values are different
        IF valueA IS NOT EQUAL TO valueB THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine the final output based on the count of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program execution
CALL Main
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

- **Input Handling**: The program takes two lines of input, where each line contains three space-separated numbers.
- **List Creation**: The inputs are split into individual numbers for comparison.
- **Counting Differences**: A loop iterates through each pair of numbers from the two lists and counts how many pairs are different.
- **Conditional Output**: After counting the differences, the program checks if the count is less than three and prints the appropriate result based on this condition.

### Comments for Clarity:
- Comments are included to explain what each part of the pseudocode does, making it easier to understand the logic without technical terminology.  

### Example Structures:
- The pseudocode is organized sequentially, showing a step-by-step flow that mimics the logical structure of the original code while being easy to read and comprehend.
