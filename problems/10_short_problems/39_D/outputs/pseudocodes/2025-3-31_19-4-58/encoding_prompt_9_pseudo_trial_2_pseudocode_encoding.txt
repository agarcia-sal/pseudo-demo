**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numbers and determine if there are fewer than three differences between them.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read the first set of numbers from the user and store it in a list called firstSet.
   - Read the second set of numbers from the user and store it in a list called secondSet.

3. **Initialize Difference Count:**
   - Set a variable named differenceCount to zero. This will keep track of how many numbers differ between the two sets.

4. **Loop through the Sets:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the positions of the three numbers):
     - Convert the number at the current index from firstSet and secondSet into integers.
     - If the numbers at the current index in firstSet and secondSet are not equal:
       - Increase differenceCount by 1.

5. **Check the Number of Differences:**
   - If differenceCount is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

6. **End Program**

7. **Execution of Program:**
   - Run the program by invoking the main function.

**Summary of Input and Output:**
- **Input:** Two sets of numbers, each containing three numbers, entered by the user.
- **Output:** A string "YES" if there are fewer than three differences between the two sets, or "NO" if there are three or more differences.
