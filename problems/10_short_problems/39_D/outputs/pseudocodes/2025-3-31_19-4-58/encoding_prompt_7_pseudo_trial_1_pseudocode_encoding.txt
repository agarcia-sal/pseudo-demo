### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Purpose:** The purpose of the script is to compare two sets of three numeric inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

2. **Input/Output:**
   - **Inputs:** Two lines of numeric values entered by the user.
   - **Outputs:** A message indicating "YES" if fewer than three numbers are different, otherwise "NO".

3. **Control Structures:** 
   - A loop iterates exactly three times (for each of the three numbers).

4. **Brief Complexity Context:** The logic checks for differences between corresponding numbers from the two inputs and increments a counter accordingly. The final decision is based on the count of differences.
