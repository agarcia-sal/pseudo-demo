### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. The `MainProcedure` function encompasses all operations required for the algorithm.
2. Input strings are read from the user and split into lists of their components.
3. A counter is initialized to track how many elements differ between the two lists.
4. A loop iterates over the first three elements of both lists, comparing them.
5. Based on the count of differences, the program outputs "YES" if there are fewer than 3 differences and "NO" otherwise.
6. The algorithm starts by invoking the `MainProcedure` function, ensuring a clear entry point.
