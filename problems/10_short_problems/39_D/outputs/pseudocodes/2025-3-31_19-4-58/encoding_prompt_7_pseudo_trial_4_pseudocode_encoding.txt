Here is a high-level pseudocode translation of the provided Python code, adhering to the outlined guidelines:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two sets of inputs from the user
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput
    
    // Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCounter TO 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        SET valueFromFirstList TO CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        SET valueFromSecondList TO CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the elements are different
        IF valueFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondList THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCounter BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Evaluate the number of differences and print the result
    IF differenceCounter IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
IF currentScriptIsMain THEN    
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Inputs**: The function starts by reading two lines of input, which are expected to be space-separated values.
2. **Splitting Inputs**: The inputs are split into lists for comparison.
3. **Counter Initialization**: A counter for the number of differing elements is initialized to zero.
4. **Loop Logic**:
   - It loops through the first three elements of both input lists.
   - Each element is converted from a string to an integer for comparison.
   - If the elements do not match, the counter is incremented.
5. **Result Evaluation**: After checking the differences, it evaluates whether the count of differing elements is less than three and prints "YES" or "NO" based on this condition.
6. **Execution Control**: The function `main()` is called if the current script is designated as the main program.

This structure ensures that the pseudocode is not only clear and coherent but also accurately mirrors the logic of the original code.
