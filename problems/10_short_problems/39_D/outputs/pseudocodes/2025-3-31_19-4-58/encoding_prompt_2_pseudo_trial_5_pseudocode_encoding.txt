**Pseudocode:**

Start the program

    Define a function named doMain

        Prompt the user to enter the first string of numbers and store it in the variable firstInput
        Prompt the user to enter the second string of numbers and store it in the variable secondInput

        Split the firstInput string into a list of strings and store it in firstList
        Split the secondInput string into a list of strings and store it in secondList

        Initialize a counter variable named differenceCount and set it to 0

        For each index from 0 to 2 do the following:
            Convert the string at current index of firstList to an integer and store it in variable firstNumber
            Convert the string at current index of secondList to an integer and store it in variable secondNumber
            
            If firstNumber is not equal to secondNumber:
                Increase the differenceCount by 1

        If differenceCount is less than 3:
            Output "YES"
        Otherwise:
            Output "NO"

Invoke the function doMain to execute the program
