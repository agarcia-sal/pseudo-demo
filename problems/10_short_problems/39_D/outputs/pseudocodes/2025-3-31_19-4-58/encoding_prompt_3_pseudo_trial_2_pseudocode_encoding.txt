```plaintext
Function Main
    // Step 1: Obtain inputs from the user
    Prompt user for the first string of values, store it as firstInput
    Prompt user for the second string of values, store it as secondInput
    
    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of individual string values
    Create list firstValues by splitting firstInput by spaces
    Create list secondValues by splitting secondInput by spaces
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    Initialize a counter called differenceCount to 0
    
    // Step 4: Compare the values in the two lists
    For each index from 0 to 2 (since we want to compare three pairs of values)
        Convert the value at the current index of firstValues to an integer and store it in variable valueA
        Convert the value at the current index of secondValues to an integer and store it in variable valueB
        
        // Step 5: Check if the two values are different
        If valueA is not equal to valueB
            Increment differenceCount by 1

    // Step 6: Determine the result based on the count of differences
    If differenceCount is less than 3
        Output "YES"
    Else
        Output "NO"
        
End Function

// Step 7: Start the program execution
If the current module is the main module
    Call Main
End If
``` 

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode generally reflects the logic of the original code while using meaningful names and high-level descriptions.
- User inputs are clearly defined, as well as the transformation of inputs into lists.
- The counting of differences is emphasized, and the logical conditions for output decisions are straightforwardly articulated. 
- This format ensures that someone unfamiliar with programming can understand the process flow and purpose.
