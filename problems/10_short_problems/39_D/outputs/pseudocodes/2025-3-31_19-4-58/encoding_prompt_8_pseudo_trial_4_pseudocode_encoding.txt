**Purpose Summary**: The primary goal of this code is to compare two sets of three values each, counting how many values differ. If fewer than three values are different, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

---

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Get input from the user
    SET first_input TO user input
    SET second_input TO user input

    // Split the inputs into lists of values
    SET first_list TO split first_input into elements
    SET second_list TO split second_input into elements

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET difference_count TO 0 

    // Loop through the first three items in both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current items to integers
        SET first_value TO integer value of first_list[index]
        SET second_value TO integer value of second_list[index]

        // Check if the current values are different
        IF first_value IS NOT EQUAL TO second_value THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREASE difference_count BY 1 
        ENDIF
    END LOOP

    // Check how many values are different and decide outcome
    IF difference_count IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL main
```

**Comments**:
- The program takes two inputs and treats them as lists of values.
- It compares each corresponding pair of numbers from the two lists.
- The loop checks only the first three elements, counting how many of them differ.
- Based on the count of differences, it determines whether to print "YES" or "NO".
