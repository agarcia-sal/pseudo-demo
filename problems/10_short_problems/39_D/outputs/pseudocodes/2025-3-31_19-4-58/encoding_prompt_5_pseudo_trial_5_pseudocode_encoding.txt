**Purpose:** The program compares two sets of three numerical inputs and determines whether they differ in fewer than three positions, outputting "YES" if they do and "NO" otherwise.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main:
    // Read two lines of input from the user, each containing three numbers
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet

    // Split the input strings into separate numbers
    SET firstNumbers = split firstSet into individual numbers
    SET secondNumbers = split secondSet into individual numbers

    // Initialize a count to track the number of differences
    SET differenceCount = 0 

    // Loop through the numbers in the two sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert the current numbers from strings to integers
        SET firstNumber = convert firstNumbers[index] to integer
        SET secondNumber = convert secondNumbers[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the current numbers from both sets are different
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber THEN:
            // Increment the difference count if they are different
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
    
    // After comparing all numbers, check the difference count
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN:
        // If there are fewer than three differences, output "YES"
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE:
        // If there are three or more differences, output "NO"
        OUTPUT "NO"

// Execute the main function if this script is run directly
IF this script is run as the main program THEN:
    CALL main
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The program utilizes input reading, splitting of strings, and integer conversion.
- It counts the discrepancies between two sets of numbers.
- Finally, it produces output based on the count of differing elements.
