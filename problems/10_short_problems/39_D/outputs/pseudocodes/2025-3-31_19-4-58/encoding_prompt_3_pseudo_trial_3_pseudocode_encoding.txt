### Explanation:
1. **Input Section**: The code starts by capturing two lines of user input.
2. **Splitting Input**: Each line is broken into an array of values.
3. **Difference Counting**: It initializes a counter to track how many of the corresponding values differ.
4. **Loop through Values**: A loop runs through the first three elements of both arrays, comparing them one by one.
5. **Condition Checking**: If any elements differ, the counter is incremented.
6. **Final Comparison**: After the loop, it checks if the number of differences is less than three and prints an appropriate message based on this comparison. 
7. **Function Invocation**: It wraps the main logic to ensure it runs only when the script is executed directly. 

This pseudocode allows someone without programming knowledge to understand the program's flow and intent clearly.
