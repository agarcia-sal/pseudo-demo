**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start** the main procedure.

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first set of values and store it in a variable named `firstInput`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second set of values and store it in a variable named `secondInput`.

3. **Process Input:**
   - Split `firstInput` into individual components and store them in a list called `firstValues`.
   - Split `secondInput` into individual components and store them in a list called `secondValues`.

4. **Initialize a count variable:**
   - Set `discrepancyCount` to zero. This will keep track of the number of differences between corresponding values.

5. **Comparison Loop:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (this represents the first three elements of the lists):
     - Convert the value at the current index in `firstValues` to an integer and assign it to a variable named `valueFromFirst`.
     - Convert the value at the current index in `secondValues` to an integer and assign it to a variable named `valueFromSecond`.
     - Check if `valueFromFirst` is not equal to `valueFromSecond`:
       - If they are not equal, increment the `discrepancyCount` by 1.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - After the loop, check if `discrepancyCount` is less than 3:
     - If it is less than 3, print "YES".
     - Otherwise, print "NO".

7. **End** the main procedure.
