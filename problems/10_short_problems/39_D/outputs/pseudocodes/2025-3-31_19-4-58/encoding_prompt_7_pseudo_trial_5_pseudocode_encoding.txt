Here is the high-level pseudocode that encapsulates the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION compareThreeInputs()
    // Prompt user for first input
    PROMPT user for first input "Enter first set of numbers"
    STORE user input in variable firstInput

    // Prompt user for second input
    PROMPT user for second input "Enter second set of numbers"
    STORE user input in variable secondInput

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput into list firstList
    SPLIT secondInput into list secondList

    // Initialize a difference counter
    INITIALIZE differenceCount as 0 

    // Iterate over the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements from string to integer
        SET firstNumber to INTEGER value of firstList[index]
        SET secondNumber to INTEGER value of secondList[index]

        // Check if there's a difference between the two numbers
        IF firstNumber is NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function if program is run directly
IF program is RUN directly THEN
    CALL compareThreeInputs()
END IF
```

### Explanation:
1. **Purpose**: The code compares two sets of three numbers input by the user and checks how many differences exist between the two sets.
2. **Meaningful Names**: Variable names like `firstInput`, `secondInput`, `differenceCount`, `firstList`, and `secondList` provide clarity on their roles.
3. **High-Level Abstraction**: The pseudocode abstracts away low-level details such as list operations and input functions.
4. **Control Structures**: Loop and conditional constructs are explained in simple terms.
5. **Input/Output**: Clearly states what inputs are expected and what outputs are produced.
6. **Structured Format**: The pseudocode follows a structured format that is easy to read and understand.
7. **Natural Language**: Actions are described using everyday language for better comprehension.
8. **Clarity Review**: The pseudocode is straightforward and easy to follow.
9. **Complexity Context**: There are no particularly complex sections in this code; however, the loop and comparison logic are clearly outlined.
10. **Final Output Expectations**: The output is either "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison of the inputs.
