**Purpose:** The purpose of this program is to compare two sets of three integer values and determine if they differ in less than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Main Program**
   1. Prompt the user for the first set of integers and store it in a variable named `firstSet`.
   2. Prompt the user for the second set of integers and store it in a variable named `secondSet`.
   
2. **Split Input Strings**
   1. Split `firstSet` into a list of strings named `firstList`.
   2. Split `secondSet` into a list of strings named `secondList`.

3. **Initialize Difference Counter**
   1. Set a variable `differenceCount` to 0 to keep track of how many positions the sets differ.

4. **Check Each Position for Differences**
   1. For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the three positions), do the following:
      - Convert the element at that index of `firstList` to an integer and store it in a variable named `firstValue`.
      - Convert the element at that index of `secondList` to an integer and store it in a variable named `secondValue`.
      - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`, increment `differenceCount` by 1.

5. **Evaluate Number of Differences**
   1. If `differenceCount` is less than 3, display "YES".
   2. Otherwise, display "NO".

6. **End Program**

**Input:** Two sets of integers provided by the user, each containing three integers.

**Output:** A message indicating whether the two sets differ in less than three positions ("YES" or "NO").
