**Purpose Summary:**
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical values and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN Main Function
    // Read input values from the user
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = GET user input
    secondInput = GET user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    DECLARE firstSet AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE secondSet AS LIST OF STRINGS
    firstSet = SPLIT firstInput by spaces
    secondSet = SPLIT secondInput by spaces
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Compare the numerical values from both sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE firstValue AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondValue AS INTEGER
        firstValue = CONVERT firstSet[index] TO INTEGER
        secondValue = CONVERT secondSet[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // The sets differ in fewer than three positions
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO" // The sets differ in three or more positions
    END IF
END Main Function

// Program execution starts here
CALL Main Function
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The program begins by reading two lines of input, where each line should contain three numbers.
- It counts how many of the corresponding numbers from both input sets are different.
- If fewer than three numbers are different, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". 

**Note:** The example maintains a clear structure, following logical steps and avoiding technical terms to facilitate understanding.
