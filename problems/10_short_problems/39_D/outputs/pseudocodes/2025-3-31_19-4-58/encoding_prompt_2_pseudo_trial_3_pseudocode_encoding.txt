**Pseudocode Representation:**

1. **Start of Program**
   
2. **Function Definition: doMain**
   - Prompt the user to enter the first sequence of numbers and store it in variable `firstInput`.
   - Prompt the user to enter the second sequence of numbers and store it in variable `secondInput`.
   
3. **Split Input Sequences**
   - Divide `firstInput` into separate numbers and store them in a list called `firstList`.
   - Divide `secondInput` into separate numbers and store them in a list called `secondList`.

4. **Initialize Difference Counter**
   - Set a variable `differenceCount` to zero. This will keep track of how many numbers are different between the two lists.

5. **Compare Corresponding Numbers**
   - For each pair of corresponding numbers (up to the third number) from `firstList` and `secondList`:
     - Convert the current number from `firstList` to an integer and store it in variable `firstNumber`.
     - Convert the current number from `secondList` to an integer and store it in variable `secondNumber`.
     - If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`:
       - Increase the `differenceCount` by one.

6. **Check Difference Count**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Output "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO"

7. **End of Function**

8. **Main Program Execution**
   - Call the function `doMain`. 

**End of Program**
