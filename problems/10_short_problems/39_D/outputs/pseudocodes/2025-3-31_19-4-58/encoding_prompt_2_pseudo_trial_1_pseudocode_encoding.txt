**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Main Function**
   
   2. **Get Inputs**
      - Prompt the user for input and store it in a variable called `firstInput`
      - Prompt the user for another input and store it in a variable called `secondInput`
   
   3. **Split Inputs**
      - Split `firstInput` into a list of strings called `firstList`
      - Split `secondInput` into a list of strings called `secondList`

   4. **Initialize a Mismatch Counter**
      - Create a variable called `mismatchCount` and set it to zero

   5. **Compare Values**
      - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
        - Convert the corresponding value from `firstList` to an integer and store it in a variable called `firstValue`
        - Convert the corresponding value from `secondList` to an integer and store it in a variable called `secondValue`
        - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`, increment `mismatchCount` by one

   6. **Check Mismatch Count**
      - If `mismatchCount` is less than 3:
        - Output the string "YES"
      - Otherwise:
        - Output the string "NO"

7. **End Main Function** 

8. **Execute Main Function on Program Start**
