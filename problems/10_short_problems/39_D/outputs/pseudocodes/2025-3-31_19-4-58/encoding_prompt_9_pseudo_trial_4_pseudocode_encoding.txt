**Purpose:** This program compares two sets of three numeric values to determine how many values are different. If there are fewer than three differences, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Get the first set of numbers from the user.
   - Get the second set of numbers from the user.

3. **Split Input into Individual Numbers:**
   - Break the first set of numbers into a list called `firstSet`.
   - Break the second set of numbers into a list called `secondSet`.

4. **Initialize a Difference Counter:**
   - Set a variable called `differenceCount` to 0.

5. **Compare Corresponding Numbers:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the number from the `firstSet` at the current index to an integer and call it `firstNumber`.
     - Convert the number from the `secondSet` at the same index to an integer and call it `secondNumber`.
     - If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`:
       - Increment the `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Check the Number of Differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Output "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO"

7. **End of Program**
