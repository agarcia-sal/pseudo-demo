**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to compare two sets of three numeric values and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read the first line of input and store it as the first set of values (firstSet).
   - Read the second line of input and store it as the second set of values (secondSet).

3. **Process Input:**
   - Split firstSet into individual values.
   - Split secondSet into individual values.

4. **Initialize Difference Counter:**
   - Set a variable called differenceCount to 0 to keep track of how many values differ between the two sets.

5. **Compare Values:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the value from firstSet at this index to a number (firstValue).
     - Convert the value from secondSet at this index to a number (secondValue).
     - If firstValue is not equal to secondValue:
       - Increment the differenceCount by 1.

6. **Determine Result:**
   - If differenceCount is less than 3:
     - Output "YES" indicating the sets differ in fewer than three positions.
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO" indicating the sets differ in three or more positions.

7. **End Program**
