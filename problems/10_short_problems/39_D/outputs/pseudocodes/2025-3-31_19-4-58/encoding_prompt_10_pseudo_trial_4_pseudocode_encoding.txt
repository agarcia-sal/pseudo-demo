**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    DECLARE variable t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE variable t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE variable tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE variable tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE variable res AS INTEGER WITH INITIAL VALUE 0

    // Read two lines of input from the user
    SET t1 = GET USER INPUT()
    SET t2 = GET USER INPUT()

    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    SET tt1 = SPLIT t1 USING SPACE AS DELIMITER
    SET tt2 = SPLIT t2 USING SPACE AS DELIMITER

    // Iterate over the first three elements of both lists
    FOR EACH index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE variable a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE variable b AS INTEGER

        SET a = CONVERT tt1[index] TO INTEGER
        SET b = CONVERT tt2[index] TO INTEGER

        // Check if the values are different
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the number of differences is less than three
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution block
CALL doMain()
```

### Breakdown of the Components:
1. **Functions and Variables**: Identified the `doMain` function and declared necessary variables with their types.
2. **Input Handling**: Read inputs and split into lists of strings for further processing.
3. **Looping and Conditions**: Used a loop to compare values and conditionals to check differences.
4. **Output/Response**: Printed "YES" or "NO" based on the condition.
5. **Assumptions**: The code assumes that valid inputs will be given, formatted correctly as space-separated integers.

### Clarity and Readability:
The pseudocode uses simple language to explain each step, making it accessible and easy to understand, while ensuring that traditional programming concepts are represented plainly.
