**Pseudocode:**

Begin by creating a function named "doMain".

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Read the first line of input and store it in a variable named `inputFirstLine`.
   - Read the second line of input and store it in a variable named `inputSecondLine`.
   - Split `inputFirstLine` into parts and store them in a list called `firstList`.
   - Split `inputSecondLine` into parts and store them in a list called `secondList`.

2. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Create a variable named `differenceCount` and set it to zero. This will keep track of how many elements differ between the two lists.

3. **Comparison Loop:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the first three elements of both lists):
     - Convert the element from `firstList` at the current index to an integer and store it in a variable called `firstValue`.
     - Convert the element from `secondList` at the current index to an integer and store it in a variable called `secondValue`.
     - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`:
       - Increase `differenceCount` by one.

4. **Output Decision:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

5. **Function Invocation:**
   - Call the `doMain` function to execute the logic.

End of Pseudocode.
