**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    STRING firstInput = READ user input
    STRING secondInput = READ user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    LIST OF STRING firstList = SPLIT firstInput into words
    LIST OF STRING secondList = SPLIT secondInput into words
    
    // Initialize a variable to count differences
    INTEGER differenceCount = 0

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        INTEGER firstValue = CONVERT firstList[index] to integer
        INTEGER secondValue = CONVERT secondList[index] to integer

        // Check if the current elements are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference count
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check if the number of differences is less than three
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program by calling the main function
CALL main()
```

**Explanation:**
- The pseudocode begins by defining the main function where the logic resides.
- It reads two lines of input and splits them into lists of values.
- An integer variable is initialized to track how many elements differ between the two input lists.
- The algorithm loops over the first three elements of both lists, comparing them after converting them to integers.
- If the elements are not equal, it increments the count of differences.
- Finally, it checks if the count of differences is less than three and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result. 
- The program starts execution by calling the main function.
