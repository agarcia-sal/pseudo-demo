### Purpose
The primary goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numbers provided by the user and determine if they differ in less than three positions.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION Main
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine
    
    // Split the input lines into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstLine INTO listFirst
    SPLIT secondLine INTO listSecond
    
    // Initialize a counter to keep track of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through each of the three numbers
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string numbers into integers
        SET numberFromFirstList TO CONVERT listFirst[index] TO INTEGER
        SET numberFromSecondList TO CONVERT listSecond[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF numberFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO numberFromSecondList THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREASE differenceCount BY 1 
        ENDIF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine the result based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        // If there are less than 3 differences, print "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        // If there are 3 or more differences, print "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Call the Main function to execute the program
CALL Main
```

### Comments for Clarity
- **Input Handling**: The program captures two lines of input containing three space-separated numbers each.
- **Difference Counting**: The program checks each position of the two lists; if the numbers differ, it increments a counter.
- **Decision Making**: After checking all positions, the program decides whether to print "YES" (indicating fewer than three differences) or "NO" (indicating three or more differences). 

This pseudocode clearly outlines the program's logic without the use of specific programming syntax while being accessible to readers who may not have a programming background.
