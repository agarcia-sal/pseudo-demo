**Purpose Statement**: This code compares two sets of three integer values and determines whether they differ in fewer than three positions, producing a corresponding "YES" or "NO" output based on the result.

**Pseudocode**:

```
Function CompareIntegers:
    // Get two sets of three integers from the user
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet

    // Split the input strings into lists of integers
    firstList = SPLIT firstSet into a list
    secondList = SPLIT secondSet into a list

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Iterate through the first three integers in both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert string values to integers
        firstValue = CONVERT firstList[index] to an integer
        secondValue = CONVERT secondList[index] to an integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue is NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN:
            // Increment the difference counter
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 

    // Determine if the count of differences is less than three
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN:
        OUTPUT "YES"  // Indicate that the differences are acceptable
    ELSE:
        OUTPUT "NO"   // Indicate that there are too many differences

// Main process begins here
CALL CompareIntegers
```

**Annotations for Clarity**:
- **INPUT**: Represents taking user input.
- **SPLIT**: Indicates breaking a string into components based on spaces.
- **CONVERT**: Means changing data types (e.g., from string to integer).
- **OUTPUT**: Refers to displaying a message to the user.
- Logical flow is structured with conditions and loops to process the inputs systematically.
