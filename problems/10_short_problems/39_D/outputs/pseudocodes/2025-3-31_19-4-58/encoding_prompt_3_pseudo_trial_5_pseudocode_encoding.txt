Here's a structured pseudocode representation of the provided code snippet, focusing on the intent and logic without relying on specific programming syntax:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read input from the user
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = GET user input
    secondInput = GET user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    DECLARE firstList AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE secondList AS LIST OF STRING
    firstList = SPLIT firstInput by spaces
    secondList = SPLIT secondInput by spaces

    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0

    // Loop through the first three values of both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string values to integers
        DECLARE valueFromFirstList AS INTEGER
        DECLARE valueFromSecondList AS INTEGER
        valueFromFirstList = CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        valueFromSecondList = CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER

        // Check if the values are different
        IF valueFromFirstList IS NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondList THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the number of differences and output the result
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
CALL main
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode starts by declaring variables for user input and then reads two lines of input.
2. **Data Processing:** The input strings are split into lists to separate individual values.
3. **Comparison Logic:** A loop is used to iterate through the first three values, checking for differences and updating a counter.
4. **Conditional Output:** Finally, the number of differences is checked, and a message ("YES" or "NO") is printed based on the count of differences. 

This structure clearly conveys the intention and flow of the original code and should be easy to understand for someone not familiar with the specific programming language used.
