**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstLine
    INPUT secondLine
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of items
    SPLIT firstLine INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondLine INTO secondList
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    differenceCount = 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        valueFromFirstLine = CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        valueFromSecondLine = CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the elements are different
        IF valueFromFirstLine IS NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondLine THEN
            INCREASE differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check the number of differences and provide output
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
CALL main()
``` 

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The function begins by reading two lines of input which are expected to contain space-separated values.

2. **Splitting Input:** It then splits those inputs into separate lists or arrays.

3. **Initialization:** A counter is initialized to track how many values differ between the two lists.

4. **Looping through Values:** A loop runs for the first three values in both lists, converting each to an integer while checking if they are different.

5. **Counting Differences:** Each time a difference is found, the counter is increased.

6. **Decision Making:** After the loop, it checks if the count of differences is less than 3. Depending on the result, it outputs either "YES" or "NO". 

This pseudocode captures the essence and logic of the original code without specific programming syntax, making the algorithm easy to understand.
