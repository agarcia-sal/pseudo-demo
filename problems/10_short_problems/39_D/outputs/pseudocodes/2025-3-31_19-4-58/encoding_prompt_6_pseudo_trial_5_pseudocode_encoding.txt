### Explanation:
- The pseudocode starts from defining the main function, `Main()`, which encapsulates the entire logic.
- It reads two strings from user input and splits them into lists.
- A counter for the differences is initialized to zero.
- The pseudocode iterates over the first three indices of the lists, comparing corresponding values.
- For every difference found, the counter is incremented.
- Finally, it checks the value of the difference counter to determine whether to print "YES" or "NO" based on the count of differences. 
- The program then defines an entry point to execute the `Main()` function when run.
