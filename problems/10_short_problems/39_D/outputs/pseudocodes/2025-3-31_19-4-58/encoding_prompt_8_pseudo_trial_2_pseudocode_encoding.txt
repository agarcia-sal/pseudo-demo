**Purpose Summary**: The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three input values and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three positions, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two sets of input from the user
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet
    
    // Split the input strings into individual elements
    SPLIT firstSet INTO firstValues
    SPLIT secondSet INTO secondValues
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through each pair of corresponding values
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO 
        // Convert the string values to integers
        SET valueFromFirstSet TO CONVERT firstValues[index] TO INTEGER
        SET valueFromSecondSet TO CONVERT secondValues[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF valueFromFirstSet IS NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondSet THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check if the number of differences is less than three
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution begins here
CALL main()
```

**Additional Comments**:
- The pseudocode uses clear and descriptive names for variables and functions to enhance understanding.
- The algorithm breaks down the process into logical steps: reading input, comparing values, and determining the output.
- Control structures (loops and conditionals) are described in a straightforward manner, making the logic easy to follow.
