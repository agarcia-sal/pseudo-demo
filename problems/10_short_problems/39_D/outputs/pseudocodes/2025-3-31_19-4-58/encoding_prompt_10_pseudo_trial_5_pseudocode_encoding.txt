Here is the pseudocode based on the given Python code, following the structured language concepts and guided steps:

```
BEGIN FUNCTION doMain
    // Step 1: Read input values from the user
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of strings
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 AT SPACES
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 AT SPACES

    // Step 3: Initialize result counter
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER
    SET res TO 0

    // Step 4: Iterate over the first three elements in the lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER
        SET a TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        SET b TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER

        // Step 5: Compare both integers
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Determine and print the result based on comparisons
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Main entry point of the program
BEGIN PROGRAM
    CALL doMain
END PROGRAM
```

### Assumptions:
1. Input values are valid strings representing integers that can be split and converted.
2. The program is expected to handle exactly three elements after the split operation.
3. The program handles comparisons based on integer values derived from the input.
