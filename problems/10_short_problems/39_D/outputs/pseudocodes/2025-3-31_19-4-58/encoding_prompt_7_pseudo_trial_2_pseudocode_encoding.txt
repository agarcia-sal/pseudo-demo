Here's the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Get two input strings from the user
    INPUT firstInput
    INPUT secondInput
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SPLIT firstInput INTO firstList
    SPLIT secondInput INTO secondList
    
    // Initialize a variable to count differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the elements at the current index to integers
        SET firstValue TO INTEGER OF firstList[index]
        SET secondValue TO INTEGER OF secondList[index]

        // If the values are different, increment the difference count
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // If the number of differences is less than 3, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO"
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Call the main function to execute the program
IF program is executed as main THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Context Explanation
- **Input and Output:** The program expects two strings as input, each containing three numbers separated by spaces. It outputs "YES" if the numbers differ in fewer than 3 positions; otherwise, it outputs "NO."
- **Logic Summary:** The main function checks how many numbers differ at corresponding positions in the two lists and determines if these differences meet the specified criteria (i.e., fewer than 3 differences).
- **Control Structures:** The pseudocode clearly outlines the use of a loop, conditionals for comparison, and the structure of input/output operations, making it easy to understand the flow of the program.
