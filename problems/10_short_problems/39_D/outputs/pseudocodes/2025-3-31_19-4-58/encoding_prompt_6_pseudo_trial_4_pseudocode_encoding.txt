### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    firstInput = USER INPUT
    secondInput = USER INPUT
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    DECLARE firstTokens AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE secondTokens AS LIST OF STRING
    firstTokens = SPLIT firstInput BY SPACE
    secondTokens = SPLIT secondInput BY SPACE
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Compare the corresponding elements of the two lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the token to an integer
        DECLARE firstValue AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondValue AS INTEGER
        firstValue = CONVERT firstTokens[index] TO INTEGER
        secondValue = CONVERT secondTokens[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue â‰  secondValue THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine and print the result based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by defining a `main` function that handles input from the user.
2. **Data Splitting**: It splits the input strings into lists, effectively breaking them into manageable parts for comparison.
3. **Comparison Loop**: A loop iterates through the first three elements of both lists, converting each element to an integer and checking for differences.
4. **Counting Differences**: For each difference found, a counter is incremented.
5. **Output Decision**: After the loop, the pseudocode checks if the count of differences is less than three, printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
6. **Function Call**: The `main` function is called to execute the program. 

This pseudocode is designed to be simple and accessible, ensuring that the fundamental logic is clear and understandable without any programming language intricacies.
