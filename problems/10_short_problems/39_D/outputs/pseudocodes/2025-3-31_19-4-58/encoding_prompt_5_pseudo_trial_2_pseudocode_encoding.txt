### Purpose
The purpose of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions, outputting "YES" if they do and "NO" if they don't.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION compareInputs()
    // Get the first set of three numbers from the user
    DISPLAY "Enter the first set of numbers:"
    firstInput = GET user input
    // Get the second set of three numbers from the user
    DISPLAY "Enter the second set of numbers:"
    secondInput = GET user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    firstSet = SPLIT firstInput into a list
    secondSet = SPLIT secondInput into a list

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    differenceCount = 0

    // Loop through each position of the sets (0 to 2)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the numbers at the current index to integers
        firstNumber = CONVERT firstSet[index] to integer
        secondNumber = CONVERT secondSet[index] to integer

        // If the numbers are different, increment the difference counter
        IF firstNumber is not equal to secondNumber THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // If the number of differences is less than 3, print "YES"
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        DISPLAY "YES"
    ELSE
        // Otherwise, print "NO"
        DISPLAY "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL compareInputs()
```

### Explanation of Key Components

- **Inputs:** The program prompts the user for two sets of three numbers, received as strings.
  
- **Processing:** It splits these input strings into lists to allow comparison of the individual numbers. A counter tracks how many numbers differ between the sets.

- **Comparison Loop:** The loop iterates through the three number pairs, checking for equality and incrementing the counter when they differ.

- **Output:** After evaluating the differences, the program outputs "YES" if there are fewer than three differences and "NO" otherwise.
