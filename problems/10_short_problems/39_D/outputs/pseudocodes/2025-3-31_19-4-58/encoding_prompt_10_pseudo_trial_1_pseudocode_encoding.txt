### Pseudocode

**Assumptions:**
- Input strings `t1` and `t2` are expected to contain three space-separated integer values.
- These integers can be converted from string format to integer format successfully.

**Main Components:**
- Input: Two strings containing integers.
- Split operation: To separate the integers in the strings.
- Loop: A `for` loop to iterate through the integer values.
- Conditional Statements: To compare values and determine the result.
- Output: Print statements to display "YES" or "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    
    // Read input from user
    SET t1 TO user input
    SET t2 TO user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists
    SET tt1 TO split(t1) // splits t1 into a list of strings
    SET tt2 TO split(t2) // splits t2 into a list of strings
    
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER
    SET res TO 0 // Initialize result count
    
    // Loop through the first three elements
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER
        
        SET a TO convert tt1[x] to INTEGER
        SET b TO convert tt2[x] to INTEGER
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1 // Increment the difference counter
    
    // Decide based on the count of differences
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES" // Less than three differences
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO" // Three or more differences
    
END FUNCTION

// Main program execution
CALL doMain()
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode defines a main function `doMain`, where user inputs are read and processed.
- The inputs are split into lists of strings, then converted into integers.
- A loop counts the number of differing integers between the two inputs. Based on this count, it prints "YES" if differences are less than three and "NO" otherwise.
- Clear variable declarations and meaningful names enhance readability.
