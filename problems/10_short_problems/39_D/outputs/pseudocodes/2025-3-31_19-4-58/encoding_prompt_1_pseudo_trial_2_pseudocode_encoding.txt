**Pseudocode:**

Define a function `doMain` that performs the following steps:

1. **Input Collection:**
   - Read the first line of input and store it in variable `input1`.
   - Read the second line of input and store it in variable `input2`.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Split `input1` into a list called `list1`.
   - Split `input2` into a list called `list2`.
   - Initialize a counter variable `differenceCount` to zero.

3. **Comparison Loop:**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the value at the current index of `list1` to an integer and store it in variable `valueA`.
     - Convert the value at the current index of `list2` to an integer and store it in variable `valueB`.
     - If `valueA` is not equal to `valueB`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1.

4. **Output Decision:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

Finally, execute the `doMain` function when the program starts.
