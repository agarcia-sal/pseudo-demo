**Objective:** The primary goal of this program is to compare two input sequences of three numerical values and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions.

---

**Pseudocode:**

Begin Program

  // Define the main function
  Function main()

    // Accept input for two sequences of numbers
    Set firstSequence = Read input from user
    Set secondSequence = Read input from user

    // Split the input sequences into lists of numbers
    Set firstList = Split firstSequence into a list
    Set secondList = Split secondSequence into a list

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    Set differenceCount = 0 

    // Iterate over the range of the list indices (0 to 2, inclusive)
    For index from 0 to 2 do:

      // Convert the elements at the current index to integers
      Set firstNumber = Convert firstList[index] to integer
      Set secondNumber = Convert secondList[index] to integer

      // Compare the two numbers
      If firstNumber is not equal to secondNumber then:
        // Increment the counter if they are different
        Increase differenceCount by 1 

    // Check if the number of differences is less than 3
    If differenceCount is less than 3 then:
      // Print "YES" if fewer than 3 differences are found
      Output "YES"
    Else:
      // Print "NO" if 3 or more differences are found
      Output "NO"

  // Execute the main function as the starting point of the program
  Call main()

End Program

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

1. The program starts by defining a main function that encapsulates its logic.
2. It prompts users to input two sequences of numbers.
3. Each sequence is then split into a list to facilitate easy access to each number.
4. It initializes a counter to keep track of how many positions differ between the two lists.
5. The program loops through the indices of the lists, compares the corresponding numbers, and checks for differences.
6. Based on the total number of differences found, it outputs either "YES" or "NO" accordingly, indicating whether the two sequences are similar or different. 

This structured approach allows readers to easily comprehend the program's functionality without needing specific programming language syntax.
