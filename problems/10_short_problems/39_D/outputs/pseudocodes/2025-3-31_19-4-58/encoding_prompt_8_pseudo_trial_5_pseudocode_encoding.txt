### Purpose
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numbers and determine if they are different in fewer than three positions. If they differ in fewer than three positions, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of numbers
    SET firstInput TO input from user
    SET secondInput TO input from user

    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    SET firstNumbers TO split firstInput into a list of strings
    SET secondNumbers TO split secondInput into a list of strings

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0

    // Iterate through the numbers at each corresponding position
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string numbers to integers
        SET firstNumber TO convert firstNumbers[index] to an integer
        SET secondNumber TO convert secondNumbers[index] to an integer
        
        // Check if the numbers at the same position are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1

    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"

// Start the program by calling the main function
CALL main
```

### Notes
- **Input Handling**: The program takes two lines of input, each containing three numbers separated by spaces.
- **Logic**: It counts how many numbers differ between the two sets and checks if that count is less than three.
- **Output**: The output is either "YES" if there are fewer than three differences or "NO" if there are three or more differences.
