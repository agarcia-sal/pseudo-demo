**Pseudocode:**

1. **Function Definition: Start Main Function**
   - Define a function named `doMain`.

2. **Input Collection: Get Input Values**
   - Read a line of input from the user, representing the first set of values, and store it in a variable named `firstInput`.
   - Read a second line of input from the user, representing the second set of values, and store it in a variable named `secondInput`.

3. **Data Preparation: Split Input into Lists**
   - Split the string in `firstInput` into a list of individual string values named `firstValues`.
   - Split the string in `secondInput` into a list of individual string values named `secondValues`.

4. **Initialize Counter: Set a Difference Counter**
   - Initialize a variable named `differenceCount` and set it to 0.

5. **Comparison Loop: Iterate and Count Differences**
   - For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the value at `firstValues[index]` to an integer and store it in a variable named `valueA`.
     - Convert the value at `secondValues[index]` to an integer and store it in a variable named `valueB`.
     - If `valueA` is not equal to `valueB`:
       - Increase the `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Conditional Check: Decide Output Based on Count**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

7. **Program Execution: Run Main Function if Script is Executed**
   - If this script is being run directly (not imported as a module), call the `doMain` function to start the process.
