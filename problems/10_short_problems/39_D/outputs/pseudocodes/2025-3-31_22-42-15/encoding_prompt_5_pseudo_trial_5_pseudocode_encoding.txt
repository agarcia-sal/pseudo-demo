**Purpose Statement:**
The code is designed to compare two sequences of three integers and determine if there are fewer than three differences between them.

**Pseudocode:**

```
START MAIN FUNCTION

    // Step 1: Accept input for two sequences
    PRINT "Enter first sequence of three integers:"
    READ firstSequence
    PRINT "Enter second sequence of three integers:"
    READ secondSequence

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of integers
    firstList = SPLIT firstSequence into individual parts
    secondList = SPLIT secondSequence into individual parts

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Step 4: Compare integers in both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        firstNumber = CONVERT firstList[index] to integer
        secondNumber = CONVERT secondList[index] to integer
        // Step 5: If numbers are different, increment the counter
        IF firstNumber IS NOT EQUAL TO secondNumber THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Determine if the difference count is less than three
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END MAIN FUNCTION
```

**Explanation of Key Points:**

- **Input and Output:** The program reads two strings containing three integers each and outputs "YES" if the differences are fewer than three; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
- **Loop Structure:** The loop iterates three times to compare corresponding elements in both lists, emphasizing a clear range and simple counter operation.
- **Conditional Logic:** The conditional checks if the two numbers being compared are not equal, which determines the increment of the counter for differences.
- **Clarity:** The pseudocode avoids specific programming syntax and focuses on the logic and flow of operations, making it accessible for all readers.
