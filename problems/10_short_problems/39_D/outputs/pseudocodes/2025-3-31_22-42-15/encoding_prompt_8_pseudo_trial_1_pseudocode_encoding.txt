**Purpose**: The program compares two lists of three integers each, determining if they are similar based on the count of differing values. It outputs "YES" if the lists differ in fewer than three positions and "NO" otherwise.

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION mainProcedure
    // Read the first list of integers as a string
    VARIABLE firstInput AS STRING
    firstInput = READ user input

    // Read the second list of integers as a string
    VARIABLE secondInput AS STRING
    secondInput = READ user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of integers
    VARIABLE firstList AS LIST OF INTEGERS
    firstList = SPLIT firstInput by spaces AND CAST each element to integer

    VARIABLE secondList AS LIST OF INTEGERS
    secondList = SPLIT secondInput by spaces AND CAST each element to integer

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    VARIABLE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Compare the integers in the two lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        VARIABLE firstValue AS INTEGER
        firstValue = firstList[index]

        VARIABLE secondValue AS INTEGER
        secondValue = secondList[index]

        // If the values differ, increase the difference count
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Check the count of differences to determine the output
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main procedure
CALL mainProcedure
```

### Comments:
- The program first gathers two strings of numbers entered by the user.
- It splits those strings into lists and converts each number from a string to an integer.
- It counts how many numbers differ between the two lists, focusing only on three specific positions.
- Depending on the count of differences, it prints "YES" or "NO" as the final output.
