### Explanation of the pseudocode:
- The **main function** reads two sequences of numbers from user input.
- Each input is split into a list for processing.
- It initializes a counter for differences and iterates through the first three elements of both lists, comparing them.
- If the numbers differ, it increments the difference count.
- After the loop, it checks if the difference count is less than 3, printing "YES" if it is and "NO" otherwise.
- The program starts executing by calling the main function if the script is executed as the main module.
