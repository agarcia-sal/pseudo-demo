### Purpose Summary
The objective of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical values entered by the user and determine if they differ by fewer than three values, providing a simple "YES" or "NO" response based on that comparison.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION MainProcedure
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    UserInput1 = READ_USER_INPUT()  // First set of numbers
    UserInput2 = READ_USER_INPUT()  // Second set of numbers

    // Split the input strings into lists of individual string numbers
    NumberList1 = SPLIT_STRING(UserInput1) // Split first input
    NumberList2 = SPLIT_STRING(UserInput2) // Split second input

    DifferenceCount = 0  // Initialize a counter for differences

    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        NumberA = CONVERT_TO_INTEGER(NumberList1[index]) // Convert first input number to integer
        NumberB = CONVERT_TO_INTEGER(NumberList2[index]) // Convert second input number to integer

        // Check if the two numbers are different
        IF NumberA IS NOT EQUAL TO NumberB THEN
            Increase DifferenceCount by 1 // Increment the difference counter
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the count of differences is less than 3
    IF DifferenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"  // Output "YES" if fewer than 3 differences
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"   // Output "NO" if 3 or more differences
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main procedure when the program starts
IF PROGRAM_IS_EXECUTED THEN
    CALL MainProcedure()
END IF
```

### Key Operations and Input/Output Clarification
1. **Input**: The program reads two lines of input, each containing three space-separated numbers.
2. **Processing**: The numbers are split into lists, compared in pairs, and counted to determine how many differences exist between the two lists.
3. **Output**: If the differences are fewer than three, "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.

### Breakdown of Complexity
- The code utilizes a simple loop to check each pair of corresponding numbers.
- The logic clearly defines the criteria for the output based on the count of differences.

### Comments for Clarity
Throughout the pseudocode, comments are added to explain the purpose of variables and key actions, ensuring the logic is easy to follow.
