### Purpose Summary
The code compares two sets of three integer values to determine whether they differ in fewer than three positions. Based on this comparison, it outputs either "YES" or "NO".

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
FUNCTION main
    // Read two lines of input from the user, each representing a set of integers
    SET firstInput TO read user input
    SET secondInput TO read user input

    // Split the inputs into lists of strings
    SET firstList TO split firstInput into separate elements
    SET secondList TO split secondInput into separate elements

    // Initialize a counter to keep track of differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through each index from 0 to 2 (representing the three integers)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the string representations to integers
        SET firstValue TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondList[index] to integer

        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine whether the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function if this script is run
IF this_script_is_main THEN
    CALL main
END IF
```

### Explanation of Key Elements
- **Input Handling**: Two inputs are taken from the user and split into separate values.
- **Comparison Loop**: The loop runs through three predefined positions to compare the corresponding integers from both inputs.
- **Counting Differences**: A counter keeps track of how many positions have different values.
- **Output Decision**: Based on the resulting count of differences, a message "YES" or "NO" is printed.

### Comments for Clarity
- Each section clearly identifies its purpose, such as reading inputs, processing data, and outputting results, making it easy to follow the overall logic of the program.
