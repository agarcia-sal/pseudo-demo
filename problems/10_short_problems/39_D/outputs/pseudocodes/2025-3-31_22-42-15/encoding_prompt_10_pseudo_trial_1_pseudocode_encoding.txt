**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER
    
    // Get user input for two strings
    t1 = GET user input
    t2 = GET user input
    
    // Split input strings into lists
    tt1 = SPLIT t1 by spaces
    tt2 = SPLIT t2 by spaces
    
    // Initialize result counter
    res = 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER
        
        // Convert string elements to integers
        a = CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        b = CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
        
        // Check if the elements are different
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            // Increment result if they are different
            res = res + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine and print the result based on the counter
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
CALL doMain()
```

**Assumptions:**
- Input strings (`t1` and `t2`) will contain integers separated by spaces.
- Each input will contain exactly three integer values.
- The integers can be converted without errors.
