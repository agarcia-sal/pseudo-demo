### Explanation of Complexity:
- The code reads two lines of input containing three space-separated integers each.
- It splits these inputs into lists, then compares the corresponding integers in the two lists.
- It counts how many pairs of integers differ and checks if this count is less than 3 to decide the output.
- The operation complexity is constant, O(1), because the number of comparisons is fixed at 3.
