Hereâ€™s the pseudocode, following the structured language concepts outlined:

```
FUNCTION doMain
    // Step 1: Read inputs
    SET t1 TO input from user
    SET t2 TO input from user

    // Step 2: Split input strings into lists
    SET tt1 TO split t1 into a list of strings
    SET tt2 TO split t2 into a list of strings

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET res TO 0 

    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR each x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Step 5: Convert string elements to integers
        SET a TO convert tt1[x] to integer
        SET b TO convert tt2[x] to integer

        // Step 6: Check for inequality
        IF a is NOT equal to b THEN
            INCREMENT res by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 7: Determine the output based on the count of differences
    IF res is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE 
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Step 8: Execute the main function
CALL doMain()
```

### Assumptions:
1. The inputs `t1` and `t2` are strings consisting of at least three space-separated integer values.
2. The values in `t1` and `t2` can be successfully converted to integers.
3. The comparisons are case-sensitive; thus, integer values are expected.
