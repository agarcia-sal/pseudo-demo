// Define the main procedure
PROCEDURE doMain

    // Read two input strings from the user
    SET firstInput TO user_input()
    SET secondInput TO user_input()

    // Split the input strings into lists of substrings
    SET firstList TO split_string(firstInput)
    SET secondList TO split_string(secondInput)

    // Initialize a counter for differing elements
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Iterate over the indices for the lists (assuming they both have 3 elements)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the elements to integers
        SET firstNumber TO convert_to_integer(firstList[index])

    // Check how many elements differ
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN

### Key Points Explained

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode clearly indicates reading user inputs and how they are separated into lists.
2. **Logic Flow:** The counting of differences is expressed in a clear loop that defines the conditions under which the count is incremented.
3. **Output:** The conditions for outputting 'YES' or 'NO' are straightforward and guide the reader through the decision-making process.
4. **Structured Presentation:** Indentation and comments improve readability and structure, making the logical steps easier to follow.
