**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain():
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of values
    FIRST_SET = read input from user
    SECOND_SET = read input from user
    
    // Split each set into a list of values
    SPLIT_FIRST = split FIRST_SET into a list
    SPLIT_SECOND = split SECOND_SET into a list
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    differences_count = 0 
    
    // Loop through each corresponding pair of values in the two sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO:
        // Convert the current value from each set to an integer
        value_from_first = convert SPLIT_FIRST[index] to integer
        value_from_second = convert SPLIT_SECOND[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the current pair of values are not equal
        IF value_from_first is NOT equal to value_from_second THEN
            // Increment the differences count if they are not equal
            differences_count = differences_count + 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine if the number of differences is less than 3
    IF differences_count IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

// The main program starts here
IF this script is executed as the main program THEN
    CALL doMain()
END IF
```

**Explanation:**

1. The function `doMain` starts by reading two lines of input.
2. Each line is split into a list of values.
3. A counter (`differences_count`) is initialized to track how many values differ between the two lists.
4. A loop iterates through the first three values of each list, converting each to an integer and checking for equality.
5. If the values differ, the counter is incremented.
6. After the loop, it checks if the count of differences is less than 3. If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
7. The program executes this logic if it is run as the main program.
