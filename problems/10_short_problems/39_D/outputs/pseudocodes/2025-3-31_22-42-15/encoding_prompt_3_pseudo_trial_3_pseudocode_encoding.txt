FUNCTION doMain
    // Step 1: Gather Input
    PROMPT user for input and store it in variable input1
    PROMPT user for input and store it in variable input2

    // Step 2: Split Inputs into Lists
    SPLIT input1 into list variable list1 using whitespace as delimiter
    SPLIT input2 into list variable list2 using whitespace as delimiter

    // Step 3: Initialize a Result Counter
    SET resultCounter to 0

    // Step 4: Compare Elements of Both Lists
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        // Convert current elements to integers
        SET valueFromList1 to integer of list1[index]
        SET valueFromList2 to integer of list2[index]
        
        // Step 5: Check if the values are different
        IF valueFromList1 is NOT equal to valueFromList2 THEN
            INCREMENT resultCounter by 1

    // Step 6: Determine the Result
    IF resultCounter is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"

// Step 7: Execute the Main Function
CALL doMain

In this pseudocode, I've structured the logic to clarify the flow from input collection to processing and output. Each step is presented clearly, maintaining a high-level focus on the algorithm's intent, making it understandable for anyone not familiar with the original code.
