**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION Main

    // Read input values for two test cases
    DECLARE testCase1 AS STRING
    DECLARE testCase2 AS STRING
    testCase1 = GET user input
    testCase2 = GET user input

    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    DECLARE values1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE values2 AS LIST OF STRING
    values1 = SPLIT testCase1 by spaces
    values2 = SPLIT testCase2 by spaces

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Compare corresponding elements from the two lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string values to integers
        DECLARE value1 AS INTEGER
        DECLARE value2 AS INTEGER
        value1 = CONVERT values1[index] to INTEGER
        value2 = CONVERT values2[index] to INTEGER

        // Check if the values are different
        IF value1 is NOT equal to value2 THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function when the program starts
CALL Main
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The main logic is encapsulated in the `Main` function.
   
2. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads two input strings from the user, representing two test cases.

3. **Splitting and Conversion:**
   - Each input string is split into a list of values based on spaces.
   - The corresponding values are converted from strings to integers for comparison.

4. **Counting Differences:**
   - A counter (`differenceCount`) is initialized to track how many values differ between the two lists.
   - A loop iterates over the index range of the lists (0 to 2) to compare the integer values.

5. **Conditional Logic:**
   - If a pair of values differs, the counter is incremented.
   - After the loop, the program checks if the total number of differences is less than 3 and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

6. **Program Execution:**
   - The `Main` function is called when the program runs. 

This pseudocode effectively conveys the intended logic of the original code without relying on specific programming language syntax.
