Here is the pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main():
    // Read two lines of input from the user
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    SPLIT firstSet INTO firstValues
    SPLIT secondSet INTO secondValues
    
    // Initialize a counter to track differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Compare each corresponding value in the two lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2:
        // Convert the string values to integers
        SET firstValue TO integer(firstValues[index])
        SET secondValue TO integer(secondValues[index])
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue:
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
            
    // Check the total number of differences
    IF differenceCount is less than 3:
        PRINT "YES"  // Less than 3 differences
    ELSE:
        PRINT "NO"   // 3 or more differences

// The main block to run the function
IF this script is run directly:
    CALL main()
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **Function Definition:** The pseudocode defines a main function that encapsulates the main logic of the program.
2. **Input Handling:** The input is read as two separate lines which are split into lists for processing.
3. **Comparison Logic:** It sets up a loop to compare each corresponding element in the two lists. If there is a difference, a counter is incremented.
4. **Conditional Output:** Finally, it checks the count of differences and prints "YES" or "NO" based on whether the count is below or equal to 3.
5. **Execution Control:** The pseudocode concludes with a conditional check to ensure that the main function runs when the script is executed directly. 

This structured approach maintains clarity and effectively conveys the underlying logic without being tied to programming syntax.
