### Pseudocode Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: The main function is clearly named `doMain`.
- **Input Handling**: User inputs are read and split into lists for further processing.
- **Difference Counting**: A loop iterates through the first three inputs, checking for differences and updating a counter.
- **Conditional Logic**: After counting, a simple conditional checks the number of differences and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.
- **Readable Structure**: Overall, the structure is straightforward, enhancing understanding for anyone unfamiliar with the original code logic.
