### Explanation:
1. **Purpose:** The code compares two lists of three integers and counts how many integers are different between the two lists. If differences are fewer than three, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, "NO".
  
2. **Variable Names:** Used meaningful names for variables like `firstInput`, `secondInput`, `firstValue`, and `secondValue` for clarity.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** The pseudocode highlights major operations like input collection, splitting strings, counting differences, and making output decisions, spareting the technical intricacies of Python.

4. **Control Structures:** Clearly outlined loops and conditional statements to make the logic accessible.

5. **Input and Output:** The pseudocode specifies that it takes two space-separated strings of integers as input and returns either "YES" or "NO".

6. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode follows a clear structure with function definitions and control flow representation similar to the original code.

7. **Natural Language:** Descriptions of actions are simplified to be digestible to a wide range of readers.

8. **Clarity:** The pseudocode is reviewed for clarity, covering all operational areas of the original code. 

9. **Context for Complexity:** The complexity in counting differences and making a decision is presented as straightforward logical steps.

10. **Final Output:** It effectively conveys the intent and logic behind the original Python code in a readable way.
