**Purpose Summary**: The goal of this code is to compare two sets of three numerical inputs to count how many numbers differ between them and then determine if they differ in less than three positions.

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Gather user input
    OUTPUT "Enter first set of numbers:"
    firstSet = READ user input
    OUTPUT "Enter second set of numbers:"
    secondSet = READ user input

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into individual numbers
    firstNumbers = SPLIT firstSet into a list
    secondNumbers = SPLIT secondSet into a list

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    differenceCount = 0

    // Step 4: Compare each number in the two sets
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 INCLUSIVE DO
        // Convert the current numbers from string to integer
        numberFromFirstSet = CONVERT firstNumbers[index] TO integer
        numberFromSecondSet = CONVERT secondNumbers[index] TO integer

        // Check if the numbers are different
        IF numberFromFirstSet IS NOT EQUAL TO numberFromSecondSet THEN
            // Increment the count of differences
            differenceCount = differenceCount + 1

    // Step 5: Determine the output based on the count of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"

END FUNCTION

// Entry point of the program
CALL main
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Steps**:

1. **Input Collection**: The program begins by prompting the user to enter two sets of numbers, which are read as strings.
2. **Data Preparation**: The strings are then split into individual components for easy comparison.
3. **Difference Counting**: A counter is set up to keep track of how many numbers differ between the two sets as we iterate through each position index.
4. **Comparison Logic**: Each corresponding number is compared. If they are not the same, the counter increments.
5. **Output Decision**: Finally, if the count of differences is less than three, "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed. 

This pseudocode is designed to be straightforward and readable, enabling easier understanding of the program's logic and flow.
