### Purpose
The goal of the program is to compare two sets of three integer inputs and determine if they differ in less than three positions.

### Pseudocode
```
FUNCTION compareInputsAndDetermineResult:
    // Prompt the user for two strings of input
    PROMPT user for first input string and store as firstInput
    PROMPT user for second input string and store as secondInput
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of numbers
    CONVERT firstInput into a list of numbers and store as firstList
    CONVERT secondInput into a list of numbers and store as secondList
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount to 0
    
    // Compare corresponding positions in the two lists
    FOR each position from 0 to 2:
        SET firstNumber to the number at current position in firstList
        SET secondNumber to the number at current position in secondList
        
        // If the numbers do not match, increase the difference counter
        IF firstNumber is NOT equal to secondNumber:
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
            
    // Check the total number of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3:
        OUTPUT "YES"  // Less than 3 differences means the sequences are similar enough
    ELSE:
        OUTPUT "NO"   // 3 or more differences indicate significant divergence

// Main execution starts here
IF this script is run as the main program:
    CALL compareInputsAndDetermineResult
```

### Commentary
- The function `compareInputsAndDetermineResult` orchestrates the entire comparison process.
- Input is taken from the user, which is then split into lists of integers.
- A loop iterates through the lists, counting how many positions differ between the two.
- Finally, a simple conditional checks if the differences are fewer than three, providing a "YES" or "NO" output based on the comparison. 

### Input and Output Explanation
- **Input:** Two strings containing a series of numbers (expected to be three space-separated integers each).
- **Output:** A text response saying "YES" if there are fewer than three differences and "NO" if there are three or more differences. 

This pseudocode is structured to communicate the function's purpose clearly while avoiding the complexity of programming syntax, making it accessible to a broader audience.
