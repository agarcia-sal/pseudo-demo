Here's the pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Take inputs for two sets of values
    INPUT firstSet FROM user
    INPUT secondSet FROM user

    // Split the input strings into individual elements
    SPLIT firstSet INTO firstValues
    SPLIT secondSet INTO secondValues

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    INITIALIZE differenceCount AS 0

    // Iterate over the first three elements of both sets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert current elements from string to integer
        SET a AS integer value of firstValues[index]
        SET b AS integer value of secondValues[index]

        // Check if elements at the current index are different
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the difference count is less than 3
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function when running the script
IF scriptIsExecuted THEN
    CALL main()
END IF
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Input Handling:** The code takes two input strings from the user, which are expected to contain three numerical values each.
2. **Splitting Input:** Each input string is split into a list of strings for further processing.
3. **Difference Counting:** A loop iterates through the first three values, comparing corresponding elements from both inputs and counting the discrepancies.
4. **Condition Check:** At the end of the loop, a conditional check determines if the number of differences is less than three and outputs "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
5. **Execution Control:** The function is called when the script is run as the main program. 

This high-level pseudocode captures the essential logic without getting into implementation specifics, making it accessible to a broader audience.
