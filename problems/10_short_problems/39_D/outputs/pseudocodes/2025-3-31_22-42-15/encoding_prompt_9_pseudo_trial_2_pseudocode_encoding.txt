**Purpose:** Determine if two sets of three input numbers differ in fewer than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program:**
   - Define a function called `doMain`.

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Prompt the user to input the first set of three numbers and store it as `firstSet`.
   - Prompt the user to input the second set of three numbers and store it as `secondSet`.

3. **Split the Input:**
   - Convert `firstSet` into a list of individual numbers called `listFirst`.
   - Convert `secondSet` into a list of individual numbers called `listSecond`.

4. **Initialize Difference Counter:**
   - Create a variable `differenceCount` and set it to 0. This will keep track of how many numbers differ between the two lists.

5. **Compare the Numbers:**
   - Loop through the index from 0 to 2 (representing the three positions).
     - For each index, do the following:
       - Convert the number from `listFirst` at the current index to an integer and store it as `numberFromFirst`.
       - Convert the number from `listSecond` at the current index to an integer and store it as `numberFromSecond`.
       - If `numberFromFirst` is not equal to `numberFromSecond`, increment `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Check Differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

7. **Execute the Function:**
   - If the program is run directly (not imported), call the `doMain` function.

**End of Pseudocode**

This pseudocode effectively conveys the original programâ€™s logic and steps in a simplified manner, making it easy to understand for someone with basic knowledge of programming concepts.
