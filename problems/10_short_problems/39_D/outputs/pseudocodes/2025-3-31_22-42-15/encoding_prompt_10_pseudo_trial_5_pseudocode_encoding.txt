**Pseudocode Translation:**

```
FUNCTION doMain

    // Step 1: Read two lines of input from the user
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    t1 = GET user input
    t2 = GET user input

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into lists of strings
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    tt1 = SPLIT t1 by whitespace
    tt2 = SPLIT t2 by whitespace

    // Step 3: Initialize the variable to count mismatches
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER
    res = 0 

    // Step 4: Loop through the first three elements of both lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string elements to integers
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER
        a = CONVERT tt1[x] to INTEGER
        b = CONVERT tt2[x] to INTEGER

        // Step 5: Increment the mismatch counter if elements are not equal
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            res = res + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Check the count of mismatches and print result
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

// Entry Point
CALL doMain()
```

**Assumptions:**
- The inputs `t1` and `t2` are assumed to be strings containing integers separated by spaces.
- It's assumed that both strings contain exactly three space-separated values.
