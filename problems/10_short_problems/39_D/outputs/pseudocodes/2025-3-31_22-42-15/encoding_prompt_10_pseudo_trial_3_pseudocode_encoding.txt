### Pseudocode Translation

**Assumptions:**
- The input consists of two lines of text, each containing three integer values separated by spaces.
- The integers are assumed to be valid and can be converted from string format.
  
**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO 0
    DECLARE a AS INTEGER
    DECLARE b AS INTEGER
    
    // Read two lines of input
    SET t1 TO USER INPUT
    SET t2 TO USER INPUT
    
    // Split the input strings into lists
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 BY SPACE
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 BY SPACE
    
    // Compare elements from both lists
    FOR EACH x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        SET a TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        SET b TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER
        
        IF a IS NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Determine the result based on the comparison count
    IF res IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
CALL doMain()
```

### Explanation of Main Components:
1. **Input Handling:** 
   - Receives two lines of input and stores them in variables `t1` and `t2`.

2. **String Splitting:** 
   - Parses each input line into a list of strings (`tt1` and `tt2`).

3. **Loop Structure:**
   - A `FOR` loop iterates three times (from index 0 to 2) to compare corresponding elements in the two lists.

4. **Conditional Logic:**
   - The `IF` condition checks if the integers from both lists are not equal.
   - The result (`res`) is incremented if they differ.

5. **Final Decision and Output:**
   - A final `IF` assesses if the count of differences (`res`) is less than 3 and prints "YES" or "NO" based on that check. 

This structure effectively captures the flow and logic of the original code while remaining clear and concise.
