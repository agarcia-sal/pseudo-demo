**Pseudocode:**

1. Begin the main process.
2. Prompt the user to input the first set of values and store it in a variable named firstInput.
3. Prompt the user to input the second set of values and store it in a variable named secondInput.
4. Split the first input string into a list of values and store it as firstValues.
5. Split the second input string into a list of values and store it as secondValues.
6. Initialize a counter variable called differenceCount and set it to zero.
7. For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive), perform the following:
   - Convert the value at the current index in firstValues to an integer and store it in a variable named firstValue.
   - Convert the value at the current index in secondValues to an integer and store it in a variable named secondValue.
   - If firstValue is not equal to secondValue, increment the differenceCount by 1.
8. After comparing all three values, check if differenceCount is less than 3:
   - If it is, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".
9. End the main process. 

**Input Requirements:**
- The user must provide two sets of three values each as input.

**Output Requirements:**
- The program outputs "YES" if fewer than three corresponding values are different between the two sets; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
