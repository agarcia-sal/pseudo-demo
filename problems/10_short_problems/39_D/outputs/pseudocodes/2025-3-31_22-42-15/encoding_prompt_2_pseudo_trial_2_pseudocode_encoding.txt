**Pseudocode for the Given Code**

1. **Start the program**
   
2. **Define a main function**
   - **Prompt the user for input:**
     - Read the first line of input and store it in a variable called `firstInput`.
     - Read the second line of input and store it in a variable called `secondInput`.
   
3. **Split the input into separate components:**
   - Split `firstInput` into a list of strings called `firstList`.
   - Split `secondInput` into a list of strings called `secondList`.

4. **Initialize a variable to count differences:**
   - Set a variable called `differenceCount` to 0.

5. **Compare the components from both input lists:**
   - For each index in the range from 0 to 2:
     - Convert the current item from `firstList` to an integer and store it in a variable called `firstValue`.
     - Convert the current item from `secondList` to an integer and store it in a variable called `secondValue`.
     - If `firstValue` is not equal to `secondValue`:
       - Increment the `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Determine the output based on differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

7. **End the program**
