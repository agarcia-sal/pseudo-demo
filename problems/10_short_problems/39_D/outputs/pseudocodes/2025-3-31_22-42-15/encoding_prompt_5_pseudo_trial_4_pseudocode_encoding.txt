**Purpose Summary:**  
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three input values and determine if they are similar based on how many values differ. If at least one value is the same between the two sets, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CompareInputValues

    // Step 1: Accept two sets of inputs
    SET firstInput TO read input from user
    SET secondInput TO read input from user
    
    // Step 2: Split the inputs into separate elements
    SPLIT firstInput into a list called firstList
    SPLIT secondInput into a list called secondList
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Step 4: Compare corresponding elements from both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 to 2 DO
        // Convert elements from string to integer for comparison
        SET firstValue TO integer value of firstList[index]
        SET secondValue TO integer value of secondList[index]
        
        // Check if the values differ
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    // Step 5: Determine if the inputs are similar based on the count of differences
    IF differenceCount is LESS than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"  // At least one value is the same
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"   // All values are different
    ENDIF

END FUNCTION

// Step 6: Initiate the program
CALL CompareInputValues
```

**Key Operations Explained:**
- The program reads two lines of input from the user.
- Each input line is split into a list of three separate values.
- A loop iterates through the values, counting how many differ between the two lists.
- Based on the count of differing values, a message is printed to indicate the similarity of the input sets.

**Control Structures:**
- The program uses a `FOR` loop to iterate three times (once for each value).
- An `IF` condition determines whether to increment the difference count or print the final result.

**Input and Output:**
- **Input:** Two lines of integers from the user.
- **Output:** A message ("YES" or "NO") indicating the similarity of the input sets. 

This pseudocode is structured to ensure clarity and accessibility, making it easier for those unfamiliar with programming language syntax to understand the flow and logic of the program.
