Here's the high-level pseudocode for the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION compareInputValues()
    PROMPT user to enter first input string and store it as firstInput
    PROMPT user to enter second input string and store it as secondInput
    
    SPLIT firstInput by spaces into a list called firstValues
    SPLIT secondInput by spaces into a list called secondValues
    
    INITIALIZE a counter variable mismatchCount to 0
    
    FOR each index from 0 to 2 DO
        CONVERT firstValues[index] to an integer and store it in variable firstValue
        CONVERT secondValues[index] to an integer and store it in variable secondValue
        
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT mismatchCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    IF mismatchCount is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

IF this script is run as the main program THEN
    CALL compareInputValues()
END IF
```

### Explanation of Key Components:
1. **Function Definition:** The main logic is encapsulated in the `compareInputValues` function, which processes user input and compares two sets of values.
  
2. **User Input:** The program gathers two input strings from the user, which must contain three space-separated integers each.

3. **Splitting Input:** These strings are split into lists of values for easy access and comparison.

4. **Loop for Comparison:** A loop iterates through the lists to compare corresponding integers, counting how many values differ.

5. **Conditional Output:** The program outputs "YES" if fewer than three mismatches are found, otherwise it outputs "NO".

By following the structured format and focusing on clarity, this pseudocode effectively communicates the logic and intent of the original Python code.
