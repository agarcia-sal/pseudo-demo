**Pseudocode for the Given Algorithm:**

```
FUNCTION main()
    // Read two lines of input
    SET firstInput TO read user input
    SET secondInput TO read user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists
    SET firstTriplet TO split firstInput into separate values
    SET secondTriplet TO split secondInput into separate values
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through the first three elements of both triplets
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstValue TO convert firstTriplet[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondTriplet[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    
    // Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program execution
CALL main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading two lines of input, representing two sets of triplet values.
  
2. **Data Processing**: It splits each input line into separate components (values) for easier comparison.

3. **Comparison Loop**: A loop iterates through each corresponding element in the two collections, counting how many elements are different.

4. **Conditional Output**: After counting differences, it checks if the count is less than three to decide whether to print "YES" or "NO", indicating if the sets are 'similar' enough.

This structure maintains clarity and makes the logic easily understandable without using any specific programming syntax.
