**Purpose:** The program checks whether two sets of three integers are different based on how many of their corresponding values differ. It outputs "YES" if fewer than three values differ; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN MainFunction
    // Step 1: Read two lines of input
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet
    
    // Step 2: Split the input lines into two lists of numbers
    SET firstList TO split(firstSet)
    SET secondList TO split(secondSet)
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Step 4: Compare corresponding elements from each list
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current elements to integers
        SET firstNumber TO convertToInteger(firstList[index])
        SET secondNumber TO convertToInteger(secondList[index])
        
        // Step 5: Check if the numbers are different
        IF firstNumber IS NOT equal to secondNumber THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 6: Determine the result based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
    
END MainFunction

// Main section of the program
CALL MainFunction
```

**Explanation of Steps:**

1. **Input:** The program first takes two lines of input, each containing three integers.
2. **Data Splitting:** It separates each line into individual elements, creating two lists of strings.
3. **Counting Differences:** It initializes a counter and iteratively compares the corresponding integers from both lists.
4. **Conditional Check:** For each comparison, if the numbers are not the same, it increases the counter.
5. **Output Decision:** Finally, it outputs "YES" if there are fewer than three differences, otherwise "NO". 

This pseudocode abstracts away specific programming details while clearly conveying the program's logic and flow.
