**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical values and determine if they differ in less than three positions.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the main process.**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read the first line of input and store it as a string called `firstSet`.
   - Read the second line of input and store it as a string called `secondSet`.

3. **Split Input into Lists:**
   - Split `firstSet` into a list of strings called `firstList`.
   - Split `secondSet` into a list of strings called `secondList`.

4. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Set a variable called `differenceCount` to 0. This will track the number of positions where the values in the two lists differ.

5. **Compare Corresponding Values:**
   - For each position `index` from 0 to 2 (inclusive):
     - Convert the value at `index` from `firstList` to an integer and store it as `valueFromFirst`.
     - Convert the value at `index` from `secondList` to an integer and store it as `valueFromSecond`.
     - If `valueFromFirst` is not equal to `valueFromSecond`, increment `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Evaluate the Result:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

7. **End the main process.**

**Note:** The above pseudocode maintains the logical structure and flow of the original code while using clear and descriptive terms to enhance understanding.
