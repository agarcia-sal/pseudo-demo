**Pseudocode for the Given Code:**

1. Begin the main process.
   
2. Obtain the first set of input values from the user and store it in a variable called `firstInput`. 
   
3. Obtain the second set of input values from the user and store it in a variable called `secondInput`.

4. Split `firstInput` into a list of values and store it in a variable called `firstValues`.

5. Split `secondInput` into a list of values and store it in a variable called `secondValues`.

6. Initialize a variable named `discrepancyCount` to zero to keep track of the number of differences.

7. For each index from 0 to 2 (representing the first three values):
   - Convert the value at the current index in `firstValues` to an integer and store it in a variable called `valueFromFirst`.
   - Convert the value at the current index in `secondValues` to an integer and store it in a variable called `valueFromSecond`.
   - Compare `valueFromFirst` and `valueFromSecond`:
     - If the two values are not equal, increment `discrepancyCount` by one.

8. After checking all three values, evaluate `discrepancyCount`:
   - If `discrepancyCount` is less than 3, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO".

9. End the main process.
