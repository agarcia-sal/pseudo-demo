Here is the pseudocode that encapsulates the logic of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read two lines of input representing two sets of values
    SET firstInput AS user input
    SET secondInput AS user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of values
    SPLIT firstInput INTO list firstValues
    SPLIT secondInput INTO list secondValues
    
    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0
    
    // Iterate through the first three values of both lists
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current values from strings to integers
        SET valueA AS integer value of firstValues[index]
        SET valueB AS integer value of secondValues[index]
        
        // Compare the current values
        IF valueA IS NOT EQUAL TO valueB THEN
            // Increment the difference counter if they are different
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
    
    // Check the number of differences
    IF differenceCount IS LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
END FUNCTION

// Invoke the main function when the script is executed
CALL main
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **Function Definition**: The main logic is encapsulated within a `main` function for clear structure.
2. **Input Handling**: User inputs are captured and split into manageable lists, which represent two sets of values.
3. **Loop for Comparison**: A loop runs through the first three elements of both lists, comparing corresponding values for equality.
4. **Count Differences**: A counter tracks how many values differ between the two sets.
5. **Output Conditions**: After the comparisons, the code checks the number of differences and prints "YES" if there are fewer than three, otherwise "NO".
6. **Program Execution**: The function is called at the end, allowing it to run when the program starts.

This pseudocode is designed to be intuitive and easily digestible for readers unfamiliar with the original code implementation.
