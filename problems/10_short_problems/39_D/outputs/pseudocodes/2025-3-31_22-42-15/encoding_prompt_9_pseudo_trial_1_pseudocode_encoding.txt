**Purpose:** This program compares two sets of three numerical values and determines if they differ in less than three positions. If they differ in less than three positions, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read the first set of three numbers from the user and store it in a variable named `firstSet`.
   - Read the second set of three numbers from the user and store it in a variable named `secondSet`.

3. **Split Input into Individual Numbers:**
   - Split `firstSet` into a list of individual numbers called `firstNumbers`.
   - Split `secondSet` into a list of individual numbers called `secondNumbers`.

4. **Initialize Difference Count:**
   - Set a variable named `differenceCount` to 0.

5. **Compare the Numbers:**
   - For each position from 0 to 2 (representing the three numbers):
     - Convert the number at that position in `firstNumbers` to an integer and store it in a variable named `firstNumber`.
     - Convert the number at that position in `secondNumbers` to an integer and store it in a variable named `secondNumber`.
     - If `firstNumber` is not equal to `secondNumber`:
       - Increment `differenceCount` by 1.

6. **Evaluate Differences:**
   - If `differenceCount` is less than 3:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

7. **End Program** 

This pseudocode effectively encapsulates the algorithm's logic and flow while maintaining clarity for readers who may not be familiar with specific programming syntax.
