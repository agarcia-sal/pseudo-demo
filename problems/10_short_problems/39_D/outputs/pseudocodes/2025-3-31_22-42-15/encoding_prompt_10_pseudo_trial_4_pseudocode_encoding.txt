**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION doMain()
    // Step 1: Read input values
    SET t1 to user input
    SET t2 to user input
    
    // Step 2: Split inputs into lists of strings
    SET tt1 to split t1 into a list
    SET tt2 to split t2 into a list
    
    // Step 3: Initialize a result counter
    SET res to 0
    
    // Step 4: Loop to compare elements in both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert string to integer for comparison
        SET a to convert tt1[index] to integer
        SET b to convert tt2[index] to integer
        
        // Step 5: Check if the values are different
        IF a is NOT equal to b THEN
            INCREMENT res by 1
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Step 6: Determine if the result is less than 3
    IF res is less than 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Execute the main function
CALL doMain()
```

### Assumptions:
1. User inputs are assumed to be valid and contain exactly three integers separated by spaces.
2. The integers can be converted without errors from the string representation.
3. The variable `res` is an integer initialized at 0 to count the number of differences.

### Explanation of Key Components:
- **Input Reading:** Collects user inputs for comparison.
- **String Splitting:** Separates input strings into manageable parts for analysis.
- **Looping Structure:** Iterates through indices to compare corresponding elements.
- **Conditional Statements:** Determines the outcome based on the count of differences.
