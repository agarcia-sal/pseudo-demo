**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three numerical values and determine if they differ by less than three positions, outputting "YES" if they do and "NO" otherwise.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main
    // Get two input strings representing numerical values
    INPUT firstSet
    INPUT secondSet

    // Split the input strings into lists of numerical strings
    CREATE list of numbers from firstSet by splitting the string
    CREATE list of numbers from secondSet by splitting the string

    // Initialize a counter for differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 

    // Loop through the range of three positions
    FOR each position FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert the current positions' values from strings to integers
        SET valueFromFirstSet TO integer value of numbers in firstSet at position
        SET valueFromSecondSet TO integer value of numbers in secondSet at position

        // Check if the values from both sets differ
        IF valueFromFirstSet is NOT EQUAL TO valueFromSecondSet THEN
            // Increment the difference counter
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Check the total differences and decide the output
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function when the program starts
CALL main
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Collection:** The program starts by collecting two lines of input that contain numbers. These inputs are expected to represent two sets of three numeric values each.

2. **Data Preparation:** The code splits the input strings into lists of numeric strings that can be processed individually.

3. **Difference Counting:** A loop iterates through each of the three individual numbers. Each number from both sets is compared, and if they are different, a counter is incremented.

4. **Final Decision:** After counting the differences, thereâ€™s a check to see if the count of differences is less than three. Depending on this check, the program outputs either "YES" (indicating fewer than three differences) or "NO" (indicating three or more differences).

This pseudocode ensures clarity and a logical flow that mirrors the original program while being easily understandable to non-programmers.
