Here's a structured pseudocode representation of the provided Python code, capturing its core logic and flow:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Step 1: Collect input
    DECLARE firstInput AS STRING
    DECLARE secondInput AS STRING
    OUTPUT "Enter first sequence of numbers:"
    GET firstInput FROM USER
    OUTPUT "Enter second sequence of numbers:"
    GET secondInput FROM USER

    // Step 2: Split the input strings into separate components
    DECLARE firstList AS LIST OF STRINGS
    DECLARE secondList AS LIST OF STRINGS
    firstList = SPLIT firstInput INTO LIST OF STRINGS
    secondList = SPLIT secondInput INTO LIST OF STRINGS

    // Step 3: Initialize a counter for differences
    DECLARE differenceCount AS INTEGER
    differenceCount = 0 

    // Step 4: Compare elements from both lists
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE firstValue AS INTEGER
        DECLARE secondValue AS INTEGER
        firstValue = CONVERT firstList[index] TO INTEGER
        secondValue = CONVERT secondList[index] TO INTEGER
        
        // Step 5: Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue IS NOT EQUAL TO secondValue THEN
            INCREMENT differenceCount BY 1 
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // Step 6: Determine the output based on the number of differences
    IF differenceCount < 3 THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Step 7: Execute the main function if this script is run
IF this script is the main module THEN
    CALL main
ENDIF
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Collection**: The code starts by gathering two sequences of numbers from the user.
2. **Splitting Input**: The collected strings are split into lists to process individual elements.
3. **Difference Counting**: A counter is initialized to track how many elements differ between the two lists.
4. **Comparison Logic**: A loop iterates through the first three elements of both lists, converts them to integers, and checks for differences.
5. **Output Decision**: Depending on the number of differences found, it outputs "YES" or "NO".
6. **Function Execution**: The main function is invoked if the script is executed directly. 

The pseudocode captures the essence of the original Python code while enhancing readability and understanding for those unfamiliar with programming syntax.
