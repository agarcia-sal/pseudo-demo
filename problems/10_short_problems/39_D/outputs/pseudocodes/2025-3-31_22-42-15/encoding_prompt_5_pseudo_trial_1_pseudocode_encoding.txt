**Summary of Purpose:**  
The goal of this program is to compare two sets of three integers each and determine if they differ in fewer than three positions. If they differ at fewer than three positions, the output will be "YES"; otherwise, it will be "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read two lines of input, each containing three integers
    SET firstInput TO read user input
    SET secondInput TO read user input
    
    // Split the input strings into lists of strings
    SET firstList TO split firstInput into separate elements
    SET secondList TO split secondInput into separate elements
    
    // Initialize a variable to count the differences
    SET differenceCount TO 0 
    
    // Loop through each element in the lists (we expect exactly three elements)
    FOR index FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        // Convert each string element to an integer
        SET firstValue TO convert firstList[index] to integer
        SET secondValue TO convert secondList[index] to integer
        
        // Check if the values are different
        IF firstValue is NOT equal to secondValue THEN
            // Increment the difference count
            INCREASE differenceCount by 1 
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    // Check if the count of differences is less than three
    IF differenceCount is LESS THAN 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Start the program by executing the main function
CALL main
```

**Annotations for Clarity:**
- **Input Reading:** The program reads two lines of input where each line contains three integers.
- **List Splitting:** The `split` operation breaks the input strings into a list of their string components.
- **Difference Counting:** A loop iterates over each corresponding pair of integers from the lists, counting how many pairs differ.
- **Conditional Output:** After evaluating the counts of differences, it responds with "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison made.

This structured pseudocode effectively conveys the logic and functionality of the original Python code without relying on programming-specific syntax, making it accessible to readers unfamiliar with the original language.
