**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**
2. **Define a main function.**
    - **Prompt the user for input and store the first line of input in a variable named firstInput.**
    - **Prompt the user for another input and store it in a variable named secondInput.**
    - **Split both firstInput and secondInput into lists of strings, naming them firstList and secondList respectively.**
    - **Initialize a variable named differencesCount to zero, which will track how many elements differ between the two lists.**
3. **Create a loop that will repeat three times (for three elements).**
    - **For each iteration:**
        - **Convert the corresponding elements from firstList and secondList into integers, naming them firstValue and secondValue.**
        - **Check if firstValue is not equal to secondValue. If they are different:**
            - **Increase the differencesCount by one.**
4. **After the loop ends, check if differencesCount is less than 3.**
    - **If it is, print "YES".**
    - **Otherwise, print "NO".**
5. **End the program.** 

This pseudocode captures the flow and logic of the original code without getting into the specifics of programming syntax. It clearly defines the steps involved in comparing two sets of numbers, counting the differences, and providing a response based on the results of that comparison.
