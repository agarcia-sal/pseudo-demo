**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program**
   
2. **Define main function: doMain**
   
3. **Read the first input line and store it as firstInput**
   
4. **Read the second input line and store it as secondInput**
   
5. **Split firstInput into a list of strings and store it as firstList**
   
6. **Split secondInput into a list of strings and store it as secondList**
   
7. **Initialize a variable mismatchCount to zero to keep track of differences**
   
8. **For each index from 0 to 2 (inclusive):**
   - Retrieve the value from firstList at the current index and convert it to an integer, store it as firstValue
   - Retrieve the value from secondList at the current index and convert it to an integer, store it as secondValue
   - If firstValue is not equal to secondValue:
     - Increment mismatchCount by 1

9. **If mismatchCount is less than 3:**
   - Output "YES"
   
10. **Otherwise:**
   - Output "NO"
   
11. **End of main function**

12. **If this script is being run directly (not imported as a module):**
   - Call the doMain function to begin execution of the program. 

**End of Pseudocode**
