Here is the translation of the given Python code into clear and concise pseudocode using structured language concepts:

```plaintext
FUNCTION doMain
    DECLARE t1 AS STRING
    DECLARE t2 AS STRING
    DECLARE tt1 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE tt2 AS LIST OF STRING
    DECLARE res AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO 0

    // Get input from the user
    SET t1 TO USER INPUT
    SET t2 TO USER INPUT

    // Split the input strings into lists
    SET tt1 TO SPLIT t1 INTO LIST USING SPACE AS DELIMITER
    SET tt2 TO SPLIT t2 INTO LIST USING SPACE AS DELIMITER

    // Compare corresponding elements of the two lists
    FOR x FROM 0 TO 2 DO
        DECLARE a AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO CONVERT tt1[x] TO INTEGER
        DECLARE b AS INTEGER INITIALIZED TO CONVERT tt2[x] TO INTEGER

        IF a NOT EQUAL TO b THEN
            INCREMENT res BY 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Determine if the result is less than 3
    IF res < 3 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main Execution
CALL doMain()
```

### Key Components Identified:
- **Input/Output**: Collects input from the user and prints the result.
- **Lists**: Uses lists to store split string values.
- **Loop**: Iterates over a range of indices to compare elements.
- **Conditionals**: Checks if variables are not equal and evaluates the result for final output.

### Complex Elements Breakdown:
- The string splitting and conversion to integers are kept in separate steps to clarify each action's purpose.

### Assumptions:
- The function expects two lines of input containing three space-separated integer values.
- The input format is controlled - exactly three integers are given in each line.

### Clarity and Readability:
- Meaningful identifiers (like `a`, `b`, `res`) represent their purposes clearly. The flow of the logic is simple and easy to follow.

### Verb Tenses:
- Present tense is consistently used to describe actions in the pseudocode.
