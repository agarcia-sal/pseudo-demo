**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a function named 'calculate_remainder' that takes two inputs:**
   - 'total_items' (representing the total number of items)
   - 'group_size' (representing the size of each group)

2. **Inside the function:**
   - Calculate the number of complete groups by dividing 'total_items' by 'group_size', storing the result in 'complete_groups'.
   - Calculate the remainder (the number of items that do not fit into complete groups) by finding the remainder of 'total_items' when divided by 'group_size', storing it in 'remaining_items'.
   - **If there are any remaining items (i.e., 'remaining_items' is greater than 0):**
     - Return the product of 'remaining_items' and the sum of 'complete_groups' plus 1.
   - **Otherwise (if there are no remaining items):**
     - Return 'total_items'.

3. **Read a single line of input containing three space-separated numbers:**
   - 'n' (the total number of items in the first category).
   - 'm' (the total number of items in the second category).
   - 's' (the group size).

4. **Call the function 'calculate_remainder' with 'n' and 's', and store the result in 'result_n'.**

5. **Call the function 'calculate_remainder' with 'm' and 's', and store the result in 'result_m'.**

6. **Calculate the final output by multiplying 'result_n' and 'result_m'.**

7. **Print the final output.**
