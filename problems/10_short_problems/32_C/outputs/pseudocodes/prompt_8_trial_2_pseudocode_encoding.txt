**Purpose**: The primary goal of this code is to calculate a specific product related to two numbers, `n` and `m`, given a divisor `s`. It determines how these numbers can be divided and remainders' contributions to the overall product.

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainingUnits(totalUnits, divisor):
    // Divide total units into groups defined by the divisor
    wholeGroups, remainder = Divide totalUnits by divisor
    // If there is a remainder, adjust the total count by adding to it
    IF remainder is greater than 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (wholeGroups plus 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN totalUnits

// Read input numbers from the user
READ inputNumbers AS a list of integers
// Assign the first number to totalUnitsN, the second to totalUnitsM, and the third to divisor
totalUnitsN, totalUnitsM, divisor = inputNumbers

// Calculate the contributions of totalUnitsN and totalUnitsM using the divisor
remainingUnitsN = calculateRemainingUnits(totalUnitsN, divisor)
remainingUnitsM = calculateRemainingUnits(totalUnitsM, divisor)

// Calculate the overall product of the two contributions
result = remainingUnitsN multiplied by remainingUnitsM

// Print the final result
PRINT result
```

### Explanation of Operations:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `calculateRemainingUnits` takes two parameters: the total units available (either from `n` or `m`) and the divisor (`s`). It computes how much needs to be added from the remainder when divided by the divisor.

2. **Input Handling**: The code reads three integers from standard input, which represent two quantities and a divisor.

3. **Calculating Adjusted Units**: It calls the `calculateRemainingUnits` function for both input quantities (`totalUnitsN` and `totalUnitsM`) to compute their respective adjusted values.

4. **Final Output**: Finally, it prints out the product of the two calculated adjusted quantities, providing the result of the operations.

This pseudocode is designed to convey the logic of the original code in a clear and understandable manner while avoiding specific programming syntax.
