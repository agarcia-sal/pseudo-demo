**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start** 
   
2. **Define a function called `calculate_remainder_product` that takes two parameters:**
   - `number1` (represents the first input number)
   - `divisor` (represents the second input number which is used for division)

3. **Within the function:**
   - Divide `number1` by `divisor` to get:
     - `quotient` (the whole number part of the division)
     - `remainder` (the part left over after the division)
   - If the `remainder` is greater than zero:
     - Calculate and return the value of `remainder` multiplied by (`quotient` + 1)
   - Otherwise:
     - Return `number1` as it is.

4. **Read a line of input consisting of three space-separated integers:**
   - Assign the first integer to `value1`
   - Assign the second integer to `value2`
   - Assign the third integer to `divisor`

5. **Call the function `calculate_remainder_product` with `value1` and `divisor`, and store the result in `product1`**
   
6. **Call the function `calculate_remainder_product` with `value2` and `divisor`, and store the result in `product2`**

7. **Calculate the final result by multiplying `product1` with `product2`**

8. **Print the final result**

9. **End**
