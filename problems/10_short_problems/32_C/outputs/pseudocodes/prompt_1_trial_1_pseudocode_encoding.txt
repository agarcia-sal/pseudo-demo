**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
FUNCTION calculate_remainder_and_adjust(quantity, divisor)
    // Divide quantity by divisor and get the quotient and the remainder
    Quotient, Remainder = DIVIDE quantity BY divisor
    
    // If there is a remainder, return the product of the remainder and (quotient + 1)
    IF Remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN Remainder * (Quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN quantity
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Read input values for total quantity 'n' and 'm', and segment size 's'
READ n, m, s from user input

// Calculate the adjusted values for n and m using the function
AdjustedN = CALL calculate_remainder_and_adjust(n, s)
AdjustedM = CALL calculate_remainder_and_adjust(m, s)

// Output the product of the adjusted values
PRINT AdjustedN * AdjustedM
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Function Definition**: `calculate_remainder_and_adjust` takes two parameters: `quantity` and `divisor`. It computes how many segments of size `divisor` fit into `quantity` and how much remains.
- **Calculation Logic**:
  - It divides `quantity` by `divisor` to obtain a `Quotient` and `Remainder`.
  - If there is a `Remainder`, it returns the product of that remainder and the incremented quotient.
  - If there's no remainder, it simply returns the original `quantity`.
- **Input Handling**: The pseudocode specifies how to read inputs for `n`, `m`, and `s`.
- **Final Computation**: It calculates the adjusted values for both `n` and `m` and outputs their product. 

This structure captures the intention and flow of the original code without the specifics of any programming language syntax.
