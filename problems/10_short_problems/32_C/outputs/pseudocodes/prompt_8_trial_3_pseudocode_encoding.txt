**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to read two numbers from input, compute a certain function on each of these numbers using a specified size, and then output the product of the two computed results.

---

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Define Function to Calculate Adjusted Quotient**:
   - Function `CalculateAdjustedQuotient(totalItems, groupSize)`:
     - Divide the total number of items by the size of each group and get both the quotient and the remainder.
     - If there is a remainder, return the remainder multiplied by one more than the quotient.
     - If there is no remainder, return just the total number of items.

2. **Get Inputs**:
   - Read a line of input and split it into three parts, converting each part into an integer:
     - Let `totalItemsA` be the first number from the input.
     - Let `totalItemsB` be the second number from the input.
     - Let `groupSize` be the third number from the input.

3. **Compute Results**:
   - Call `CalculateAdjustedQuotient(totalItemsA, groupSize)` and store the result in `resultA`.
   - Call `CalculateAdjustedQuotient(totalItemsB, groupSize)` and store the result in `resultB`.

4. **Output Final Result**:
   - Print the product of `resultA` and `resultB`.

**Detailed Breakdown**:

1. **CalculateAdjustedQuotient(totalItems, groupSize)**:
   - INPUT: totalItems (integer), groupSize (integer)
   - OUTPUT: Adjusted group size based on totalItems and groupSize
   - PROCESS:
     - Find the quotient of totalItems divided by groupSize (how many full groups can be formed).
     - Find the remainder of that division (how many items are left over).
     - IF there are leftover items (remainder > 0):
       - Return the product of the remainder and (quotient + 1).
     - ELSE:
       - Return totalItems.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - Read input values for `totalItemsA`, `totalItemsB`, and `groupSize` from the user.
   - Calculate adjusted values for both `totalItemsA` and `totalItemsB` using the `CalculateAdjustedQuotient` function.
   - Calculate the final result by multiplying the two adjusted values.
   - Display the final result.

This pseudocode aims to provide a clear representation of the logic and essence of the original code without delving into syntax specifics, making it accessible to a wider audience.
