Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code, following the outlined instructions:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderDivision(number, divisor)
    // Calculate how many whole times divisor fits into number and the remainder
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE number BY divisor
    // If there is a remainder, use it to slightly adjust the result
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1) // Add one to the quotient because of the remainder
    ELSE
        RETURN number // Return the original number if no remainder
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main flow of the program
BEGIN
    // Read input values for total1, total2, and partitionSize
    INPUT total1, total2, partitionSize FROM user
    
    // Compute adjusted values using the calculateRemainderDivision function for both totals
    adjustedTotal1 = calculateRemainderDivision(total1, partitionSize)
    adjustedTotal2 = calculateRemainderDivision(total2, partitionSize)

    // Calculate and print the product of the adjusted values
    PRINT adjustedTotal1 * adjustedTotal2
END
```

### Explanation:
1. **Purpose:** The code calculates a modified product based on the division of two numbers (total1 and total2) by a given divisor (partitionSize).
2. **Function `calculateRemainderDivision`:** This function computes how the division of a number affects the result when there is a remainder, adjusting the outcome accordingly.
3. **Main Flow:** The main section reads input numbers, applies the calculation function, and outputs the product of the adjusted results.
4. **Control Structures:** Clearly articulated `IF` statements and loop/conditional mechanics using simple statements.
5. **Input/Output:** Inputs are explicitly defined (total1, total2, partitionSize), and the main output is the product of the two adjusted totals.
  
This pseudocode is structured to be easy to read and understand, maintaining a high-level abstraction while effectively conveying the algorithm's intent.
