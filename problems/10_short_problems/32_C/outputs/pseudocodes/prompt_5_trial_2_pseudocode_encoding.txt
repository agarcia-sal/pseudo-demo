**Purpose:** This code computes a product of two quantities based on a specific modulo operation, applied to two inputs, in order to round up the results when divided by a third input.

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
FUNCTION CalculateRemainderAndRoundUp(divisionAmount, divisor):
    # Perform integer division to find how many times the divisor fits into the divisionAmount
    quotient, remainder = divisionAmount DIVIDED BY divisor WITH REMAINDER
    
    # If there is any remainder, return the product of the remainder and the next whole number (quotient + 1)
    IF remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder TIMES (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        # If there is no remainder, return the divisionAmount as is
        RETURN divisionAmount

# Read input values from the user
READ n, m, s FROM USER INPUT   # This will be three integers separated by spaces

# Calculate the adjusted values for n and m based on s
valueForN = CalculateRemainderAndRoundUp(n, s)
valueForM = CalculateRemainderAndRoundUp(m, s)

# Calculate the final result as the product of the two adjusted values
finalResult = valueForN TIMES valueForM

# Print the final result to the console
OUTPUT finalResult
```

**Explanation of Key Operations:**

1. **CalculateRemainderAndRoundUp function:** 
   - Divides a number (`divisionAmount`) by another number (`divisor`), determining how many whole times the divisor fits.
   - Checks if there is any remainder:
     - If there is a remainder, it rounds up the result by multiplying the remainder by the next whole number (the quotient plus one).
     - If no remainder exists, it simply returns the original number.

2. **Input Handling:** 
   - The program reads a single line of input containing three values (n, m, and s) separated by spaces and converts them into integers.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - It computes two separate modified values by calling the `CalculateRemainderAndRoundUp` function for both n and m, using s as the divisor.
   - The result from these calculations is multiplied to yield the final result, which is then printed. 

By summarizing the operations and using clear names, this pseudocode effectively communicates the program's logic in an accessible manner.
