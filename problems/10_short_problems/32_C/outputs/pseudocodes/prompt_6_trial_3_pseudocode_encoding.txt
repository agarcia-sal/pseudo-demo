Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that represents the logic of the provided code:

```plaintext
FUNCTION calculate_remaining_items(total_items, group_size):
    // Divide the total items by the group size
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE total_items BY group_size
    // If there is a remainder, we need to account for an additional group
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder times (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN total_items // No extra group needed

// Read inputs: total_items_for_n, total_items_for_m, group_size
READ total_items_for_n, total_items_for_m, group_size FROM INPUT

// Calculate the remaining items for total_items_for_n
remaining_items_for_n = calculate_remaining_items(total_items_for_n, group_size)

// Calculate the remaining items for total_items_for_m
remaining_items_for_m = calculate_remaining_items(total_items_for_m, group_size)

// Compute the final result by multiplying the remaining items
final_result = remaining_items_for_n times remaining_items_for_m

// Output the final result
PRINT final_result
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: A function `calculate_remaining_items` is defined to handle the logic of determining how many groups of items could be formed, and if there are leftover items, how they are accounted for.
- **Input Handling**: Input values for two totals and a group size are read.
- **Calculations**: The function is called to compute results for both input totals, and these results are multiplied together to get the final output.
- **Output**: Finally, the result is printed. 

This pseudocode captures the logic of the original code while simplifying the presentation and providing clear variable names for better understanding.
