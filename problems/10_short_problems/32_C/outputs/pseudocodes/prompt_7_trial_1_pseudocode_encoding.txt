// Read integers from input representing n, m, and s
INITIALIZE n, m, s AS LIST OF INTEGERS FROM INPUT

// Calculate the adjusted group sizes for both totals

### Explanation:
1. **Purpose:** The code calculates an adjusted value based on groups created from two input totals (`n` and `m`), taking into account a specified group size (`s`), and then prints the product of the two adjusted values.
  
2. **Function Name:** The function `mc` is renamed to `calculate_result` to clarify its purpose. 

3. **Control Structure:** Loops and conditionals are clearly defined using straightforward language.

4. **Input and Output:** The pseudocode captures the input process and specifies the outputs in a consolidated manner.

5. **Descriptive Language:** Actions are articulated in simple terms, making them accessible regardless of the reader's programming background. 

This pseudocode provides a structured and clear representation of the original code's logic.
