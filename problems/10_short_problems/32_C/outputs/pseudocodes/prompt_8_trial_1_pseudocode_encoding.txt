**Purpose Summary**: The goal of this code is to calculate a specific result based on two input numbers, `n` and `m`, and a divisor `s`. The result is determined by processing these values through a mathematical function that focuses on partitioning the numbers.

**Pseudocode**:

```plaintext
Function calculateAdditionalPortions(number, divisor):
    // Calculate how many full portions can be obtained by dividing number by divisor
    fullPortions, remainder = Divide number by divisor

    // If there is a remainder, we can add one more portion; otherwise, return the original number
    If remainder is greater than 0:
        Return remainder multiplied by (fullPortions + 1)
    Else:
        Return number

// Read input values for number_of_items1, number_of_items2, divisor from the user
Input number_of_items1, number_of_items2, divisor

// Calculate the additional portions for both inputs
additionalPortions1 = calculateAdditionalPortions(number_of_items1, divisor)
additionalPortions2 = calculateAdditionalPortions(number_of_items2, divisor)

// Calculate and display the final result by multiplying the two additional portions
Output additionalPortions1 multiplied by additionalPortions2
```

### Key Details and Steps Explained:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `calculateAdditionalPortions` computes how many additional portions can be derived when dividing a given number by a divisor.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads three integers from the input: `number_of_items1`, `number_of_items2`, and `divisor`.

3. **Processing**:
   - For each input number, it calculates how many full portions can be made and checks if there is a remainder. Depending on the remainder, it decides how many "effective portions" to return.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final output is the product of the two results obtained from the function for the two input numbers, which is printed as the result.

### Comments for Clarity:
- The use of `Divide number by divisor` implies a standard division that calculates both quotient and remainder.
- The conditional checks ensure that if any portions fit into the number, it considers an additional portion based on any leftover.
- The multiplication of results serves to combine the outcomes from both input scenarios, providing a final calculation tailored to the inputs received.

This structure is straightforward for readers to understand how the calculations and logic flow together, while removing programming-specific syntax.
