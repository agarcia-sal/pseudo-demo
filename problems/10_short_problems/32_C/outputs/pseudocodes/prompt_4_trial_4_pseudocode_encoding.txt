```
FUNCTION mc(number, divisor)
    QUOTIENT, REMAINDER = DIVIDE(number, divisor)
    IF REMAINDER > 0 THEN
        RETURN REMAINDER * (QUOTIENT + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number
END FUNCTION

READ inputs n, m, s FROM user
CALCULATE result1 = mc(n, s)
CALCULATE result2 = mc(m, s)
OUTPUT result1 * result2
``` 

### Comments:
- The `mc` function calculates a value based on the input number and a divisor. It adjusts the result based on the remainder of the division.
- The main section reads three integers from the user, applies the `mc` function to both `n` and `m`, and outputs their product.
