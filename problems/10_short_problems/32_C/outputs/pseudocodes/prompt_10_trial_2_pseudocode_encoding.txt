**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
FUNCTION mc(n, s)
    SET q TO n DIV s          // Compute the quotient of n divided by s
    SET r TO n MOD s          // Compute the remainder of n divided by s
    IF r > 0 THEN             // Check if there is a remainder
        RETURN r * (q + 1)    // If true, return the adjusted value using the quotient
    ELSE
        RETURN n               // If false, return n as is
END FUNCTION

// Main program begins here
READ n, m, s FROM input     // Read three integers from input

SET result_n TO mc(n, s)     // Call mc function with n and s
SET result_m TO mc(m, s)     // Call mc function with m and s

PRINT result_n * result_m     // Print the product of the two results
```

**Assumptions:**
1. The input provided is valid and consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `s`.
2. Variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers, and `s` is not zero to avoid division by zero.
