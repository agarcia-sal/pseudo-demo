**Objective**: The primary goal of the code is to calculate a specific product derived from two integer values, `n` and `m`, adjusted based on a third integer value, `s`. This adjustment ensures that the results are rounded up when necessary.

**Pseudocode**:

```plaintext
DEFINE FUNCTION calculate_adjusted_value(total_items, group_size):
    // Calculate how many complete groups can be formed and the remainder
    COMPLETE_GROUPS, REMAINDER = DIVIDE total_items BY group_size
    // If there is a remainder, it means we need to include an extra group
    IF REMAINDER IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN (REMAINDER * (COMPLETE_GROUPS + 1)) // Rounding up
    ELSE
        RETURN total_items // No rounding needed

// Read input values for total_items1, total_items2, and group_size
READ total_items1, total_items2, group_size FROM INPUT

// Calculate the adjusted values for both total_items
ADJUSTED_VALUE1 = calculate_adjusted_value(total_items1, group_size)
ADJUSTED_VALUE2 = calculate_adjusted_value(total_items2, group_size)

// Output the product of the two adjusted values
PRINT (ADJUSTED_VALUE1 * ADJUSTED_VALUE2)
```

**Clarifications**:
- **calculate_adjusted_value**: This function computes how many complete groups can be made from a given number of items (total_items) based on the specified size of each group (group_size). If there are leftover items after forming complete groups, it ensures these are accounted for by adding an additional group.
- **Input and Output**: The program receives three integers (total_items1, total_items2, group_size) from the user and prints the product of the adjusted values derived from `total_items1` and `total_items2`.
