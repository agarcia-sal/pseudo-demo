**Purpose:**  
The code calculates a specific value based on two input numbers and a divisor, implementing a method to round values influenced by the divisor.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION calculateRoundedValue(number, divisor):
    // Divide number by divisor to get quotient and remainder
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE number BY divisor
    
    // If there is a remainder, the result is remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    // Otherwise, if no remainder, simply return the number
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number

// Read three numbers from input
READ inputs FROM standard input
number1, number2, divisor = CONVERT inputs TO integers

// Calculate rounded values for both inputs
roundedValue1 = calculateRoundedValue(number1, divisor)
roundedValue2 = calculateRoundedValue(number2, divisor)

// Print the product of the two rounded values
OUTPUT roundedValue1 MULTIPLIED BY roundedValue2
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- `DIVIDE` is a basic operation that returns both the quotient and remainder of the division.
- The function checks if there is a remainder to determine which value to return, reflecting rounding behavior.
- The input section captures user-provided numbers and converts them into integers for processing.
- The final output is the product of two computed values, showing how both inputs influence the result together. 

This pseudocode is designed to be clear and concise while effectively conveying the underlying logic and functionality of the original code.
