**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Function** `mc(total_items, group_size)`
   - Calculate the number of complete groups: `full_groups` = total_items divided by group_size
   - Calculate the remainder: `remaining_items` = total_items modulo group_size
   - If there are remaining items:
       - Return the product of `remaining_items` and (`full_groups` + 1)
   - Otherwise (no remaining items):
       - Return total_items

2. **Main Program**
   - Read a single line of input containing three integers: `number_of_items_n`, `number_of_items_m`, and `group_size_s`
   - Split the input into individual integers
   - Compute value_1 using `mc(number_of_items_n, group_size_s)`
   - Compute value_2 using `mc(number_of_items_m, group_size_s)`
   - Calculate the final result by multiplying value_1 and value_2
   - Output the final result
