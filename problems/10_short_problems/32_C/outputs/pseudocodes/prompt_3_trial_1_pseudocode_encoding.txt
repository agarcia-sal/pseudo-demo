```plaintext
FUNCTION main

    // Read input values for n, m, and s
    INPUT n, m, s

    // Calculate the result based on the mc function for both n and m
    result = mc(n, s) * mc(m, s)

    // Display the result
    OUTPUT result

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION mc(number, step)

    // Divide number by step and find quotient and remainder
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE number BY step

    // If there is a remainder, return remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)

    // If there is no remainder, return the original number
    ELSE
        RETURN number

### Explanation
1. **Main Function:** Responsible for reading inputs and printing the output.
2. **Input Handling:** It captures three integers from the user, which represent `n`, `m`, and `s`.
3. **Calculation Logic:** It uses the `mc` function to compute modified results for `n` and `m` and then multiplies these results.
4. **mc Function:** 
   - Computes how `number` relates to `step` by calculating both the quotient and the remainder of the division.
   - Decides the return value based on whether there's a remainder or not.
  
This pseudocode provides a clear and structured view of the process without using specific programming language syntax, aiming for clarity and accessibility.
