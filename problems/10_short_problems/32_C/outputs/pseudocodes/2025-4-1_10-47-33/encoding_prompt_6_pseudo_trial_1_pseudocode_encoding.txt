```plaintext
FUNCTION main
    // Read inputs: total items, another quantity, and maximum items per group
    READ totalItems, anotherQuantity, maxItemsPerGroup FROM input

    // Calculate the final result by calling the helper function for both totalItems and anotherQuantity
    result = CALL calculateGroups(totalItems, maxItemsPerGroup) * CALL calculateGroups(anotherQuantity, maxItemsPerGroup)

    // Output the calculated result
    PRINT result
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateGroups(itemCount, itemsPerGroup)
    // Determine how many complete groups can be formed and any remaining items
    numberOfFullGroups, remainingItems = DIVIDE itemCount BY itemsPerGroup

    // If there are remaining items, return the total items in those groups
    IF remainingItems > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainingItems * (numberOfFullGroups + 1)
    ELSE
        // If there are no remaining items, return the original itemCount
        RETURN itemCount
    END IF
END FUNCTION

### Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: The pseudocode begins by reading input values which represent the total number of items and the maximum items allowed in each group.
2. **Function Call**: It then calls a helper function `calculateGroups` twice: once for the total items and once for the other quantity.
3. **Group Calculation Logic**: Inside `calculateGroups`, it computes how many full groups can be formed and checks for any remaining items. The outcome depends on whether there are leftover items.
4. **Result Output**: Finally, the result of the two calls is printed as the final output. 

This pseudocode prioritizes clarity, breaking down the logic into understandable sections without being tied to specific programming syntax.
