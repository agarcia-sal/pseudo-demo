Here's the pseudocode output based on the given Python code while adhering to the outlined steps:

---

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION mc(n, s):
    SET q, r = DIVIDE n BY s  // q is the quotient, r is the remainder
    IF r > 0 THEN
        RETURN r * (q + 1)  // When there's a remainder, return the modified value
    ELSE
        RETURN n  // If no remainder, return n as is
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Begin Main Block
DECLARE n, m, s AS INTEGER
READ n, m, s FROM USER INPUT

// Calculate the result of mc(n, s) and mc(m, s)
SET result1 = mc(n, s)
SET result2 = mc(m, s)

// Print the product of both results
PRINT result1 * result2
```

**Assumptions:**
1. `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers, and `s` is not equal to zero (to prevent division errors).
2. The user provides input in the format of three space-separated integers.
