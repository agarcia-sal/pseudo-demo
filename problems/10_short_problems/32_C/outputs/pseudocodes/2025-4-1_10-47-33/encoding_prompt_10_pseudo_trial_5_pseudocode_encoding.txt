Here is the translation of the provided code into clear and concise pseudocode using structured language concepts, following the guided steps outlined:

**Pseudocode:**

```
Function CalculateRemainder(n, s):
    // Calculate how many full groups of size s can be made from n
    Set quotient = n divided by s
    // Calculate the remainder when n is divided by s
    Set remainder = n modulo s
    
    // If there is a remainder, return the adjusted value
    If remainder > 0 Then
        Return remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    Else
        Return n

// Read input values for n, m, and s from user
Set n, m, s to user inputs as integers

// Calculate results using the defined function for n and m
Set result1 = CalculateRemainder(n, s)
Set result2 = CalculateRemainder(m, s)

// Print the product of the two results
Print (result1 multiplied by result2)
```

### Breakdown of Steps:

1. **Identify the Main Components:**
   - Function `CalculateRemainder(n, s)` is identified which computes a value based on the division and the remainder of `n` and `s`.
   - Usage of input reading and output printing in the main logic.

2. **Break Down Complex Elements:**
   - The computation in `CalculateRemainder` is broken down into calculative steps (calculating the quotient and remainder).
   - Conditional logic is clearly expressed to handle the remainder case.

3. **State Assumptions Clearly:**
   - Assumes that `n`, `m`, and `s` are non-negative integers.
   - Assumes that `s` is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero.

4. **Maintain Clarity and Readability:**
   - Meaningful identifiers like `quotient`, `remainder`, `result1`, and `result2` are used.
   - Each action is clearly stated with comments explaining each step.

5. **Choose Appropriate Verb Tenses:**
   - Present tense verbs are used throughout the pseudocode to maintain focus on actions as they are intended to occur. 

This pseudocode encapsulates the logic and structure of the original Python code in a clear, readable format.
