**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to calculate the product of two values, each modified based on a given divisor, and to output the result.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a Function to Calculate Modified Value:**
   - Function `calculate_modified_value(total, divisor)`:
     - Divide `total` by `divisor` to get two values: 
       - `quotient` (the whole number result of division) 
       - `remainder` (what is left over after division).
     - If there is a `remainder` greater than 0:
       - Return the product of `remainder` and one more than `quotient`.
     - Otherwise:
       - Return the original `total`.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Read three integer values from input and assign them to variables `n`, `m`, and `s`.
   - Call `calculate_modified_value` with `n` and `s`, store the result in `modified_n`.
   - Call `calculate_modified_value` with `m` and `s`, store the result in `modified_m`.
   - Calculate the final result as the product of `modified_n` and `modified_m`.
   - Print the final result.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
FUNCTION calculate_modified_value(total, divisor):
    quotient, remainder = divide total by divisor
    IF remainder > 0 THEN:
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE:
        RETURN total

BEGIN MAIN PROGRAM:
    READ n, m, s FROM input
    modified_n = calculate_modified_value(n, s)
    modified_m = calculate_modified_value(m, s)
    final_result = modified_n * modified_m
    PRINT final_result
END MAIN PROGRAM
``` 

**Clarifications:**
- The division operation gives both a whole number (quotient) and a leftover value (remainder).
- The program adjusts `n` and `m` based on whether there is any remainder when divided by `s`, which affects the final product output. 
- The structure is simplified to enhance comprehension for those unfamiliar with programming syntax.
