**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateRemainder(n, s)
    // Divide n by s to get the quotient and remainder
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE n BY s
    // If there is a remainder, return it multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        // If there is no remainder, return n
        RETURN n
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Read three integers from input
READ n, m, s FROM INPUT

// Calculate the adjusted values using the CalculateRemainder function
adjustedValueForN = CalculateRemainder(n, s)
adjustedValueForM = CalculateRemainder(m, s)

// Calculate the final result by multiplying the two adjusted values
finalResult = adjustedValueForN * adjustedValueForM

// Output the final result
PRINT finalResult
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode defines a function `CalculateRemainder` that takes two parameters: `n` (a number) and `s` (a divisor).
- Inside this function, we calculate how many times `s` fits into `n` (the quotient) and what is left over after this division (the remainder).
- If there is any leftover (i.e., the remainder is greater than zero), the function computes a modified value based on the original remainder and returns it; otherwise, it simply returns `n`.
- The main section of the pseudocode handles reading input values for `n`, `m`, and `s`.
- It then calculates adjusted values for `n` and `m` using the defined function.
- Finally, it multiplies these two adjusted values to get the result and prints it.
