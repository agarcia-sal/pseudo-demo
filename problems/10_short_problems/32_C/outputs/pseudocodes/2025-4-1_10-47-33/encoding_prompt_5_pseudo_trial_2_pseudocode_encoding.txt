**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to calculate a product based on two input values after applying a specific calculation that distributes each value into groups, determined by a specified size.

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
FUNCTION CalculateAdjustedGroups(value, groupSize):
    // Divide value into groups of the specified size and adjust the remainder
    quotient, remainder = Divide value by groupSize
    IF remainder is greater than 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)  // If there’s a remainder, include one extra group for it
    ELSE
        RETURN value  // If there’s no remainder, return the original value

// Read input values for n, m, and s from the user
READ n, m, s  // n is the first number, m is the second number, s is the size of groups

// Calculate the adjusted group values for n and m
adjustedN = CalculateAdjustedGroups(n, s)
adjustedM = CalculateAdjustedGroups(m, s)

// Calculate the product of the two adjusted values
product = adjustedN multiplied by adjustedM

// Output the result of the product
PRINT product
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Function Definition:** `CalculateAdjustedGroups`: This function takes two parameters, `value` (the number to be divided into groups) and `groupSize` (the size of each group).

2. **Division:** The function divides the number into integer groups and checks for a remainder.
   - If there is a remainder, it calculates how many groups are effectively created and adjusts the result by multiplying this by the size of the remainder adjusted for the extra group.
   - If there is no remainder, it simply returns the original value.

3. **Input Handling:** The program receives three space-separated integers from the user: `n`, `m`, and `s`.

4. **Calculating Adjusted Values:** It applies the `CalculateAdjustedGroups` function to both `n` and `m`.

5. **Final Calculation:** The program computes the product of the adjusted values from `n` and `m`.

6. **Output:** The program prints the final product.

This pseudocode is structured to convey the logic in a clear and accessible manner, suitable for readers who may not be familiar with programming syntax.
