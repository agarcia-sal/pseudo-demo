Hereâ€™s a translation of the provided code into clear and understandable pseudocode:

```plaintext
FUNCTION calculate_remainder_count(number, divisor):
    // Divide the number by the divisor and obtain quotient and remainder
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE number BY divisor
    
    // If the remainder is greater than zero, calculate adjusted count
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient plus 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN the original number

// Read input values
READ n, m, s FROM user input

// Calculate adjusted counts for both n and m based on s
adjusted_count_for_n = calculate_remainder_count(n, s)
adjusted_count_for_m = calculate_remainder_count(m, s)

// Compute the product of the adjusted counts for n and m
result = adjusted_count_for_n multiplied by adjusted_count_for_m

// Output the final result
PRINT result
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition**: The pseudocode defines a function called `calculate_remainder_count` that takes a number and a divisor as inputs. It calculates how many complete groups of the divisor fit into the number and how many are left over (the remainder).

2. **Input Reading**: It simulates reading inputs `n`, `m`, and `s` which represent the values needed for the calculations.

3. **Calculating Adjusted Counts**: The pseudocode calls the function to get adjusted counts for both `n` and `m`, using `s` as the divisor in both cases.

4. **Final Calculation**: It calculates the product of the two adjusted counts.

5. **Output**: Finally, it outputs the result. 

### Overall Structure:

The overall structure maintains high-level clarity, explaining the main logic through descriptive function names and comments. Each step describes what is being computed without getting too bogged down in specific syntax.
