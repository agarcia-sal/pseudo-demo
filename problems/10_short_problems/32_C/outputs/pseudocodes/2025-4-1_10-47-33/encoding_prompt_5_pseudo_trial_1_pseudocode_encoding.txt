**Purpose Summary:**  
This program calculates the product of two quantities, each modified by a function that adjusts based on specific divisibility conditions.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define function to adjust quantity:**  
   Function AdjustQuantity takes two inputs:
   - TotalCount: a number representing the total quantity (either `n` or `m`)
   - StepSize: a number that determines how the quantity is adjusted based on how it divides by the StepSize.

   **Function AdjustQuantity(TotalCount, StepSize)**
   - Divide TotalCount by StepSize to get:
     - Quotient: the whole number of times StepSize fits into TotalCount
     - Remainder: the leftover part after fitting StepSize into TotalCount
   - If Remainder is greater than 0:
     - Return (Quotient + 1) multiplied by Remainder
   - Else:
     - Return TotalCount
   End Function

2. **Read input values:**  
   - Read a line of input from the user containing three integers: 
     - FirstValue, SecondValue, and StepSize
   - Convert these values to integers.

3. **Calculate adjusted values:**  
   - Let AdjustedFirstValue = AdjustQuantity(FirstValue, StepSize)
   - Let AdjustedSecondValue = AdjustQuantity(SecondValue, StepSize)

4. **Calculate and output the final product:**  
   - Output the product of AdjustedFirstValue and AdjustedSecondValue.

**Example Annotations:**

- The `AdjustQuantity` function modifies the `TotalCount` based on how well it divides by `StepSize`, increasing the quantity conditionally.
- The final print statement produces the result of multiplying the two adjusted quantities together.

**Example Structure:**
```plaintext
FUNCTION AdjustQuantity(TotalCount, StepSize)
    Quotient, Remainder = Divide TotalCount by StepSize
    IF Remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN Remainder * (Quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN TotalCount
    END IF
END FUNCTION

INPUT FirstValue, SecondValue, StepSize FROM USER
AdjustedFirstValue = AdjustQuantity(FirstValue, StepSize)
AdjustedSecondValue = AdjustQuantity(SecondValue, StepSize)
OUTPUT AdjustedFirstValue multiplied by AdjustedSecondValue
```

**Iteration for Improvement:**  
The pseudocode is straightforward, breaking down operations into clear functions and steps, making it understandable for readers unfamiliar with programming syntax while maintaining logical flow.
