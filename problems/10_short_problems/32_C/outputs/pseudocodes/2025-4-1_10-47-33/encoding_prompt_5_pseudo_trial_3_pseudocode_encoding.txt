### Purpose

The primary goal of this code is to calculate the product of the number of full groups that can be formed from two given quantities using a specified group size, adjusting for any remainder.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
FUNCTION calculate_groups(total_items, group_size)
    # Divide total_items into groups of group_size
    number_of_groups, remainder = divide total_items by group_size
    
    # If there is a remainder, increase the count of groups by one
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN (number_of_groups + 1)  # Include the extra group for remaining items
    ELSE
        RETURN number_of_groups  # No extra group needed
    END IF
END FUNCTION

# Read three integers from user input
READ integers: total_items_a, total_items_b, group_size

# Calculate the number of groups for each quantity
groups_a = calculate_groups(total_items_a, group_size)
groups_b = calculate_groups(total_items_b, group_size)

# Calculate the product of groups formed from both quantities
result = groups_a * groups_b

# Output the final result
PRINT result
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Definition**: The `calculate_groups` function takes in the total number of items and the size of each group. It calculates how many full groups can be formed and adjusts for any leftover items.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integer values provided by the user which represent two quantities of items and the size of the group.

3. **Calculating Groups**: It calls the `calculate_groups` function twice—once for each quantity of items—to determine how many complete groups can be made from each.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final result is generated by multiplying the number of groups for both quantities.

5. **Output**: Finally, the result is printed out, showing the user the product of the number of groups from both quantities.

### Comments and Clarity

- The pseudocode uses clear and descriptive function and variable names to enhance readability.
- The logic is clearly broken down into sequential steps to ensure that any reader can follow the process without prior knowledge of programming syntax.
