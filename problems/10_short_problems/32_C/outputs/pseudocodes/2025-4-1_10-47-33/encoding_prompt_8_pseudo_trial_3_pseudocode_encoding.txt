**Purpose**: The code calculates a specific product based on inputs representing quantities and a size, rounding up quantities as needed.

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION CalculateRoundedProduct:
    INPUT: integer totalA (represents 'n'), integer totalB (represents 'm'), integer size (represents 's')
    
    // Define a function to calculate rounded quantity
    FUNCTION RoundUpIfNecessary(quantity, size):
        // Perform integer division to find how many complete sizes fit in the quantity
        completeSizes, remainder = DIVIDE quantity BY size
        
        // If there is a remainder, more than one size is needed for that quantity 
        IF remainder > 0 THEN
            RETURN (remainder * (completeSizes + 1)) // Calculate the effective total when rounding up
        ELSE
            RETURN quantity // No rounding needed, return the original quantity

    // Get inputs from user
    READ totalA, totalB, size FROM user input
    
    // Calculate the rounded values for both quantities
    roundedA = RoundUpIfNecessary(totalA, size)
    roundedB = RoundUpIfNecessary(totalB, size)

    // Multiply the rounded quantities together and display the result
    PRINT (roundedA * roundedB)
```

### Comments:
- The `RoundUpIfNecessary` function is designed to determine how many units fit into each input and adjusts based on any leftover quantity.
- The main routine first takes user input for the quantities and size, then uses the rounding function for both inputs before calculating and printing the final product.
