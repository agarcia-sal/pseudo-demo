**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Define Function**: mc(number, divisor)
   - Calculate the quotient (q) and remainder (r) of dividing `number` by `divisor`.
   - If the remainder (r) is greater than 0:
     - Return the product of the remainder (r) and the incremented quotient (q + 1).
   - Otherwise:
     - Return the original number.

3. **Input Section**
   - Read a line of input containing three integers: `total1`, `total2`, and `divisor`.
   - Convert these input values from strings to integers.

4. **Processing Section**
   - Call the mc function with `total1` and `divisor`, store the result in `result1`.
   - Call the mc function with `total2` and `divisor`, store the result in `result2`.

5. **Output Section**
   - Calculate the final product of `result1` and `result2`.
   - Print the final product.

6. **End Program** 

This pseudocode captures the overall logic and flow of the original code without getting into low-level programming details. It clarifies the operations performed and the relationships between the various components.
