Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that outlines the core logic of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainingPackages(numberOfItems, packageSize):
    QUOTIENT, REMAINDER = DIVIDE numberOfItems BY packageSize
    IF REMAINDER IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN REMAINDER MULTIPLIED BY (QUOTIENT + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN numberOfItems

BEGIN MAIN PROGRAM:
    READ numberOfItems (n), anotherValue (m), packageSize (s) FROM INPUT

    // Calculate the remaining packages for both sets of items
    remainingPackagesForN = calculateRemainingPackages(numberOfItems, packageSize)
    remainingPackagesForM = calculateRemainingPackages(anotherValue, packageSize)

    // Output the product of the two results
    PRINT remainingPackagesForN MULTIPLIED BY remainingPackagesForM
END MAIN PROGRAM
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition**: `calculateRemainingPackages` encapsulates the logic for calculating how many items would fit into full packages based on the total number of items and package size. It returns the remaining items multiplied by an adjusted quotient if there are leftovers.

2. **Main Program**: The main part of the program reads in three input values (total items, another value, and package size) and invokes the function twice to calculate results for both values.

3. **Output**: Finally, it multiplies the two results and prints the final product, representing the combined effective size of incomplete packages for both sets of items.

This pseudocode clearly communicates the logic used in the original code, making it accessible even to those unfamiliar with programming syntax.
