**Pseudocode:**

1. Start the program.
  
2. Define a function named "calculate_remainder_multiplier" that takes two inputs: total_items and group_size.
   - Within this function:
     - Divide total_items by group_size to determine how many full groups can be made, storing the result as full_groups.
     - Find the remainder when total_items is divided by group_size, storing this value as remaining_items.
     - If there are remaining items (remaining_items is greater than 0):
       - Calculate and return the product of remaining_items and (full_groups plus one).
     - Otherwise, return the value of total_items.

3. Read three integers from input: total_items_1, total_items_2, and group_size.
  
4. Call the function "calculate_remainder_multiplier" with total_items_1 and group_size, storing the result as result_1.
  
5. Call the function "calculate_remainder_multiplier" with total_items_2 and group_size, storing the result as result_2.

6. Calculate the product of result_1 and result_2.

7. Output the final product.

8. End the program.
