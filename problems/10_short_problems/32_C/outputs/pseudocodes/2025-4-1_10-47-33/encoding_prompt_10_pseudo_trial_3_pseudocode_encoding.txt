Here is the pseudocode translation of the given Python code, following the guided steps provided:

```
START

FUNCTION mc(n, s)
    // Divide n by s to get quotient and remainder
    SET q, r TO DIVIDE n BY s
    
    // Check if remainder is greater than zero
    IF r > 0 THEN
        // If there is a remainder, calculate and return extended value
        RETURN r * (q + 1)
    ELSE
        // If there is no remainder, return n
        RETURN n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Read input values for n, m, and s
READ n, m, s FROM INPUT

// Calculate the product of mc(n, s) and mc(m, s)
SET result TO mc(n, s) * mc(m, s)

// Output the result
PRINT result

END
```

**Assumptions:**
- `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers.
- There is a proper input format on standard input that matches the expectations of three integer values. 
- Division by zero is not a consideration; the value of `s` is assumed to be greater than zero. 

**Key components identified:**
- A function `mc` that computes values based on the input parameters.
- Input reading and transformation.
- Output generation showing the final computed result. 

This pseudocode presents the logic clearly while ensuring readability and maintainability without relying on specific programming language syntax.
