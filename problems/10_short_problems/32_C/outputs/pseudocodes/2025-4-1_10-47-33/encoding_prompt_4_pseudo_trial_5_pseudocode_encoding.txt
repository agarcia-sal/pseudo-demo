```plaintext
FUNCTION mc(number, segmentSize):
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE number BY segmentSize
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number

READ input values n, m, s FROM standard input
CALCULATE result1 = mc(n, s)
CALCULATE result2 = mc(m, s)
PRINT result1 * result2
``` 

### Comments:
- The `mc` function calculates the adjusted value based on how many complete segments can be formed and whether there is a remainder.
- The final output is the product of applying the `mc` function to both `n` and `m`.
