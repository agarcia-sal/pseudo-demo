FUNCTION calculate_remainder_and_adjustment(number, divisor):
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE number BY divisor AND GET BOTH
    IF remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder MULTIPLIED BY (quotient PLUS 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number

READ input values into variables n, m, s from standard input

RESULT_A = CALL calculate_remainder_and_adjustment(n, s)
RESULT_B = CALL calculate_remainder_and_adjustment(m, s)

FINAL_RESULT = RESULT_A MULTIPLIED BY RESULT_B

PRINT FINAL_RESULT
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition:** The function `calculate_remainder_and_adjustment` takes a number and a divisor, calculates the quotient and remainder, then returns either an adjusted value based on the remainder or the original number.

2. **Input Reading:** The pseudocode suggests reading values for n, m, and s.

3. **Function Calls:** It calls the function for both n and m using s as the divisor, storing the results.

4. **Final Calculation:** The final result is obtained by multiplying the two results from the function calls.

5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the calculated result.
