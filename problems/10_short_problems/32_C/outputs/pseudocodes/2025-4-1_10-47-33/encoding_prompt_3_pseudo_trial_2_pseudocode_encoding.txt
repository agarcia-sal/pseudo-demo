Here's a structured pseudocode representation of the given Python code, emphasizing clarity and intent:

```
Function CalculateRemainderCountAndMultiply(inputValue1, inputValue2, divisor):
    // Calculate the quotient and remainder when inputValue1 is divided by divisor
    quotient, remainder = Divide(inputValue1 by divisor)
    
    // If there is a remainder, return the product of the remainder and the next quotient value
    If remainder > 0 Then
        Return remainder * (quotient + 1)
    Else
        Return inputValue1 // When there is no remainder, return inputValue1

Start Main Program:
    // Read three integer inputs from user
    Read inputValue1, inputValue2, divisor from user input
    
    // Calculate the results for inputValue1 and inputValue2 using the defined function
    result1 = CalculateRemainderCountAndMultiply(inputValue1, inputValue2, divisor)
    result2 = CalculateRemainderCountAndMultiply(inputValue2, divisor)

    // Multiply the results and output the final result
    finalResult = result1 * result2
    Print finalResult
End Main Program
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition:** The `CalculateRemainderCountAndMultiply` function computes a value based on how `inputValue1` is divided by the `divisor`. It provides a mechanism to either calculate a modified remainder or return the original input based on whether there is a remainder.

2. **Main Program Flow:** The core of the program gathers input values from the user, utilizes the defined function to calculate two separate results, and then multiplies these results to produce a final output.

3. **Control Structures:** The conditional logic (`If` statements) and the operations performed in the function maintain clarity without resorting to programming-specific syntax, such as loops.

4. **Input/Output Clarity:** Inputs are clearly stated as user inputs and outputs are illustrated in the final print statement, ensuring anyone can see the purpose and direction of the data flow. 

This pseudocode effectively communicates the logic of the original code in a more general and understandable form, suitable for anyone familiar with basic programming concepts.
