**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Define function mc with parameters total_items and group_size**
   - Calculate how many complete groups of 'group_size' can be formed from 'total_items' and find the remainder when 'total_items' is divided by 'group_size'.
   - If there is a remainder (meaning not all items fit perfectly into groups):
     - Calculate the total items needed to account for incomplete groups by adding one to the number of complete groups and multiplying by the remainder.
   - If there is no remainder:
     - Return the original number of 'total_items'.

3. **Read input values:**
   - Read a line of input and convert the values into three integers: total_items_for_first_case, total_items_for_second_case, and group_size.

4. **Calculate results:**
   - Call the mc function with total_items_for_first_case and group_size, storing the result in first_result.
   - Call the mc function with total_items_for_second_case and group_size, storing the result in second_result.

5. **Output:**
   - Multiply first_result by second_result and display the final outcome.

6. **End Program** 

**Summary of Flow:**
- The program processes two sets of total items and determines how many additional items are needed based on grouping constraints. It outputs the product of the adjusted totals for both sets.
