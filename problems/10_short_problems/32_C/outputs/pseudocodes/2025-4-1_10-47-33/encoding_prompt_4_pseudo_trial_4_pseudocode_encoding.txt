```
FUNCTION mc(number, size)
    DIVIDE number BY size, STORE quotient in q AND remainder in r
    IF r IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN (r * (q + 1))  // Calculate adjusted value if remainder exists
    ELSE
        RETURN number         // Return original number otherwise
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Read input values
READ n, m, s FROM standard input
 
// Calculate result using the 'mc' function for both n and m
SET result TO (mc(n, s) * mc(m, s))

// Output the result
PRINT result
``` 

### Comments
1. The `mc` function calculates a modified value based on the input number and size. It considers the quotient and remainder of division to adjust the number based on the remainder.
2. The program reads three integers from standard input and invokes the `mc` function for both `n` and `m`, then outputs the product of the two results.
