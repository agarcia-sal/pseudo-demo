Here's the high-level pseudocode that represents the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAndProduct(n, m, s)
    FUNCTION mc(number, divisor)
        DIVIDE number by divisor to get quotient and remainder
        IF remainder is greater than 0 THEN
            RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient plus 1)
        ELSE
            RETURN number
        END IF
    END FUNCTION

    READ integers n, m, and s from input
    resultA = mc(n, s)           // Calculate modified n using mc
    resultB = mc(m, s)           // Calculate modified m using mc
    OUTPUT the product of resultA and resultB   // Print the final result
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The pseudocode defines a main function called `calculateRemainderAndProduct` that encompasses all operations.
2. **Nested Function**: Inside the main function, a helper function `mc` is declared that handles the core logic for processing a number based on the given divisor.
3. **Division and Condition**: Within `mc`, the code divides the input number by the divisor and checks the remainder to determine how to return the result.
4. **Input Handling**: The function reads three integers from the input that will be processed.
5. **Calculating Results**: It invokes the helper function `mc` for both `n` and `m` and stores the results.
6. **Output**: Finally, it calculates the product of `resultA` and `resultB` and prints the output.

This pseudocode captures the essence of the original code's logic while using meaningful names and maintaining a higher level of abstraction.
