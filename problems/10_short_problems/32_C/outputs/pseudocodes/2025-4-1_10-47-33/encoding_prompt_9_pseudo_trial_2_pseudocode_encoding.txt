**Purpose:**
The goal of this code is to calculate the product of two adjusted values based on given parameters, using a specific rounding method when dividing each value by a specified divisor.

**Pseudocode:**

```
DEFINE function adjustedValue(value, divisor)
    DIVIDE value by divisor and store the quotient and remainder
    IF remainder is greater than zero THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient plus one)
    ELSE
        RETURN value
END FUNCTION

READ input values n, m, s from standard input
CALCULATE firstAdjustedValue as the result of adjustedValue(n, s)
CALCULATE secondAdjustedValue as the result of adjustedValue(m, s)
OUTPUT the product of firstAdjustedValue and secondAdjustedValue
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** We define a function `adjustedValue` that takes two parameters: `value` and `divisor`. This function calculates how many full groups of `divisor` can fit into `value` and how much is left over (the remainder).

2. **Condition Check:** If there is any remainder after the division (indicating that `value` is not perfectly divisible by `divisor`), we return the adjusted value. This adjusted value is the remainder multiplied by the next whole number of groups.

3. **Input Handling:** We read three integers from the user input: `n`, `m`, and `s`.

4. **Value Calculations:** We use the `adjustedValue` function to compute the adjusted values for `n` and `m`.

5. **Final Output:** We print the product of the two adjusted values computed.

This pseudocode clearly outlines each step, making it easily understandable while preserving the original logic and flow of the program.
