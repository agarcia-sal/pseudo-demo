Here is the high-level pseudocode that represents the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAndTotal(n, s)
    // Divide n by s and store quotient and remainder
    SET quotient, remainder = DIVIDE n BY s

    // If remainder is greater than zero, calculate adjusted value
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION main()
    // Read three integers from input: n, m, and s
    READ integers n, m, s FROM input

    // Calculate the adjusted values for n and m using s
    SET adjustedValueN = calculateRemainderAndTotal(n, s)
    SET adjustedValueM = calculateRemainderAndTotal(m, s)

    // Calculate and print the product of the adjusted values
    PRINT adjustedValueN * adjustedValueM
END FUNCTION

// Execute the main function
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode

1. **Function Definitions**: The pseudocode defines two functions: `calculateRemainderAndTotal` for the main logic and `main` for reading input and orchestrating the flow.
   
2. **Input Handling**: The `main` function reads three integers, which represent two quantities (`n` and `m`) and a divisor (`s`).

3. **Remainder Calculation**: The `calculateRemainderAndTotal` function divides `n` by `s`, calculates the quotient and the remainder, and returns an adjusted value based on the existence of a remainder.

4. **Output**: The final output is the product of the adjusted values returned from `calculateRemainderAndTotal` for both `n` and `m`.

This pseudocode maintains a high-level abstraction, focusing on the logic and flow without getting into implementation specifics, while using clear and meaningful variable names to enhance understanding.
