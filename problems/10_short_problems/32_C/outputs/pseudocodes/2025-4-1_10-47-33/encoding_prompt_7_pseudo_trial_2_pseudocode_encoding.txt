Here's the pseudocode that accurately reflects the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAdjustment(number, divisor)
    DIVIDE number by divisor, store quotient in quotient and remainder in remainder
    IF remainder is greater than 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient plus 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION main()
    READ three integers from input and store them in n, m, and s
    SET adjustedN as calculateRemainderAdjustment(n, s)
    SET adjustedM as calculateRemainderAdjustment(m, s)
    PRINT the product of adjustedN and adjustedM
END FUNCTION

CALL main()
```

### Breakdown of the Pseudocode

1. **Function Definitions**: 
   - `calculateRemainderAdjustment` encapsulates the core logic of adjusting a number based on the divisor.
   - The `main` function handles input and coordinates the overall computation.

2. **Input Handling**: The `main` function reads three integers (`n`, `m`, `s`) from standard input.

3. **Logical Operations**: 
   - The logic for adjusting `n` and `m` is handled in `calculateRemainderAdjustment`, which uses division to determine if the remainder needs adjustment.
   - The product of the adjusted values is calculated and printed in the `main` function.

4. **Control Structures**: Clear use of `IF...THEN` conditions and function calls improves readability and understanding of the code flow.

5. **Clarity and Context**: Meaningful function and variable names enhance comprehension, ensuring the pseudocode is straightforward and understandable for readers from various programming backgrounds. 

This pseudocode retains the original code's logic while avoiding specific syntax and implementation details, making it suitable for educational purposes.
