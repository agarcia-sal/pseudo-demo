Here is the pseudocode translation of the provided Python code. This version focuses on intent, uses meaningful names, and presents a clear logic flow.

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read the input values for total1, total2, and divisor
    INPUT total1, total2, divisor FROM console

    // Calculate output using the defined formula
    OUTPUT calculateProductOfAdjustedValues(total1, divisor) * calculateProductOfAdjustedValues(total2, divisor)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateProductOfAdjustedValues(total, divisor)
    // Divide total by divisor to get quotient and remainder
    SET quotient, remainder = DIVIDE total BY divisor
    
    // If there is a remainder, calculate adjusted value
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        // If there is no remainder, return total as it is
        RETURN total
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// This is the entry point of the program
CALL main
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **main**: This function reads input values for `total1`, `total2`, and `divisor`, then calculates the final result by invoking `calculateProductOfAdjustedValues` for both totals, and outputs the product of the two results.
- **calculateProductOfAdjustedValues**: This function computes how a given total should be adjusted based on the divisor. It calculates the quotient and remainder, using these values to determine if an adjustment is necessary, and returns the adjusted value or the original total accordingly. 

The pseudocode clearly outlines the purpose and flow of the original code while avoiding specific programming syntax, ensuring clarity for someone unfamiliar with the original implementation.
