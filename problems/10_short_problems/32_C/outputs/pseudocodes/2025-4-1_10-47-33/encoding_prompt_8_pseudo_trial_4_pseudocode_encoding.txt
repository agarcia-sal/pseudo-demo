**Objective:** The primary goal of this code is to calculate the product of two quantities, `n` and `m`, after adjusting each based on a divisor `s`. The adjustments involve determining how many full groups of `s` can fit into `n` and `m`, and then incorporating any remaining items into a new group.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Function AdjustQuantity**:
   - Input: a positive integer quantity (quantity) and a divisor (divisor)
   - Calculate how many full groups can be made from the quantity:
     - fullGroups = quantity divided by divisor
     - remainder = quantity modulo divisor
   - If there is a remainder (i.e., if remainder is greater than 0), 
     - Return (remainder multiplied by (fullGroups + 1))
   - Otherwise, return the original quantity (quantity) as no adjustment is needed.

2. **Main Program Execution**:
   - Read a single line of input consisting of three integers (n, m, s) separated by spaces.
   - Convert these values to appropriate integers.
   - Call AdjustQuantity with n and s, storing the result in `adjustedN`.
   - Call AdjustQuantity with m and s, storing the result in `adjustedM`.
   - Calculate the product of adjustedN and adjustedM.
   - Print the resulting product.

**Example Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
Function AdjustQuantity(quantity, divisor):
    fullGroups = quantity divided by divisor
    remainder = quantity modulo divisor
    If remainder > 0:
        Return (remainder multiplied by (fullGroups + 1))
    Else:
        Return quantity

Begin Main Program:
    Read inputLine from standard input
    Convert inputLine into integers n, m, s
    adjustedN = AdjustQuantity(n, s)
    adjustedM = AdjustQuantity(m, s)
    result = adjustedN multiplied by adjustedM
    Print result
End Program
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The function `AdjustQuantity` is responsible for calculating how leftover items are grouped when divided by the divisor `s`.
- The main part of the program handles input, processes it with the defined function, and outputs the final result.
- This structure allows for easy understanding of how inputs influence the output through the adjustment logic.
