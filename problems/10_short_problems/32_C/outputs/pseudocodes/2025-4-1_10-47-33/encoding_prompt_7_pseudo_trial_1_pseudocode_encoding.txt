Hereâ€™s the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderUsingDivision(dividend, divisor)
    DIVIDE dividend by divisor to get quotient and remainder
    IF remainder is greater than zero THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN dividend
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION main()
    READ input values for quantityA, quantityB, size
    resultA = calculateRemainderUsingDivision(quantityA, size)
    resultB = calculateRemainderUsingDivision(quantityB, size)
    finalResult = resultA multiplied by resultB
    PRINT finalResult
END FUNCTION

CALL main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Purpose:** The `calculateRemainderUsingDivision` function computes a result based on the division of a dividend by a divisor, adjusting for any remainder.
2. **Input Handling:** The `main` function handles reading input values and invokes `calculateRemainderUsingDivision` for two quantities, quantityA and quantityB, each divided by size.
3. **Control Structures:** It utilizes conditional statements to determine the appropriate return values based on the presence of a remainder.
4. **Output:** Finally, the product of the two computed results is printed out. 

This pseudocode structure uses meaningful names and straightforward language to represent the original code's intent and operations clearly.
