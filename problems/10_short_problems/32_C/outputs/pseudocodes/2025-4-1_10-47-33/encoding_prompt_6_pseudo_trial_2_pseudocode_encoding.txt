Here's the pseudocode based on the provided code:

```
FUNCTION calculate_remainder_and_quotient(input_number, divisor):
    // Calculate the quotient and remainder when dividing input_number by divisor
    quotient, remainder = divmod(input_number, divisor)
    
    // If there is a remainder, return the product of the remainder and one more than the quotient
    IF remainder > 0 THEN:
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE:
        // If there is no remainder, return the original input_number
        RETURN input_number
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Read integers n, m, and s from user input
n, m, s = READ integers from input

// Call the function for n and s, and for m and s, and multiply the results
result = calculate_remainder_and_quotient(n, s) * calculate_remainder_and_quotient(m, s)

// Output the final result
PRINT result
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: A function `calculate_remainder_and_quotient` is defined that takes an input number and a divisor. It calculates how many times the divisor can fit into the number and the remaining part (remainder).
2. **Conditional Logic**: The function checks if there is a remainder and returns the appropriate calculation based on that.
3. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode includes a step to read three integers, which represent `n`, `m`, and `s`.
4. **Result Calculation**: It computes the desired results by invoking the defined function and multiplying the results for `n` and `m`.
5. **Output**: Finally, it outputs the final computed result.

By using descriptive names and outlining the logic in a structured manner, this pseudocode conveys the algorithm clearly and is accessible for those unfamiliar with programming syntaxes.
