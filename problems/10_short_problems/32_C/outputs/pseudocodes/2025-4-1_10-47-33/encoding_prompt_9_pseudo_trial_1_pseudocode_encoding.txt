**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to compute the product of two values, where each value is processed to account for a mathematical operation that rounds up based on a specified divisor.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a function called calculate_adjusted_value that takes two inputs:**
   - total_items (an integer representing the total number of items)
   - divisor (an integer representing the divisor for grouping items)

2. **Inside the function:**
   - Calculate the quotient (how many full groups can be formed) by dividing total_items by divisor.
   - Calculate the remainder (how many items are left after forming full groups) using the modulus operation.
   - If the remainder is greater than zero:
     - Return the product of the remainder and the sum of the quotient and one.
   - Otherwise:
     - Return total_items as is.

3. **Main logic begins here:**
   - Read three integers from user input: total_count1, total_count2, and group_size.
   - Store these values in total_count1, total_count2, and group_size respectively.

4. **Calculate the adjusted value for total_count1 and store the result in adjusted_value1:**
   - Call calculate_adjusted_value with total_count1 and group_size as arguments.

5. **Calculate the adjusted value for total_count2 and store the result in adjusted_value2:**
   - Call calculate_adjusted_value with total_count2 and group_size as arguments.

6. **Calculate the final result:**
   - Multiply adjusted_value1 by adjusted_value2 and store this value in final_result.

7. **Print final_result.**

This structured approach abstracts the core logic of the original code into human-readable pseudocode while preserving the underlying operations and flow of the algorithm.
