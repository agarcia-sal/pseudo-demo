Here's a structured pseudocode representation of the provided code, maintaining clarity and intent:

```
Function CalculateRemainderSum(dividend, divisor):
    // Divide the dividend by divisor to get the quotient and remainder
    quotient, remainder = Divide(dividend, divisor)
    
    // If there is a remainder, return the product of remainder and (quotient + 1)
    If remainder > 0 Then
        Return remainder * (quotient + 1)
    Else
        Return dividend  // If no remainder, return the original dividend

// Read input values
Read n, m, s from standard input

// Calculate the modified sum for n and m using the CalculateRemainderSum function
resultN = CalculateRemainderSum(n, s)
resultM = CalculateRemainderSum(m, s)

// Output the product of the two results
Output resultN * resultM
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode Structure:
1. **Function Definition:** The `CalculateRemainderSum` function captures the logic of the original `mc` function, performing the division and handling the remainder.
   
2. **Input Handling:** It describes reading input values `n`, `m`, and `s` in a straightforward manner.

3. **Calculating Results:** The pseudocode emphasizes the flow of logic when using the function to get results for `n` and `m`.

4. **Output:** It clearly indicates that the final step is to output the product of the results derived from the function. 

This format retains the core logic and intent without getting bogged down in programming syntax, making it accessible to someone unfamiliar with the original code.
