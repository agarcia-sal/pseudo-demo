**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
2. **Define a Function** named `calculate_remainder_with_adjustment` that takes two parameters: 
   - `total_quantity`
   - `segment_size`
   
   **Inside the Function:**
   - Calculate how many full segments fit into `total_quantity`. Store this count in `full_segments_count`.
   - Calculate the remaining quantity after fitting those full segments. Store the remainder in `remaining_quantity`.
   - If there is any remainder (meaning `remaining_quantity` is greater than 0), return the product of `remaining_quantity` and one more than `full_segments_count`. This accounts for the need to adjust due to the leftover items.
   - If there is no remainder, simply return `total_quantity` as is.
   
3. **Get Input**: Read a line of input and extract three integer values:
   - `total_items_n`
   - `total_items_m`
   - `segment_size_s`
   
4. **Calculate Adjusted Remainders**: 
   - Call the function `calculate_remainder_with_adjustment` with `total_items_n` and `segment_size_s`, store the result in `adjusted_n`.
   - Call the function `calculate_remainder_with_adjustment` with `total_items_m` and `segment_size_s`, store the result in `adjusted_m`.
   
5. **Compute Final Output**: Multiply `adjusted_n` and `adjusted_m` to get the final result.
6. **Display the Result**: Print the final result.

7. **End Program**
