Here is the pseudocode based on the provided code, structured clearly and concisely:

```plaintext
FUNCTION mc(n, s)
    SET q TO n DIVIDED BY s       // Calculate quotient
    SET r TO n MOD s              // Calculate remainder
    IF r > 0 THEN
        RETURN r MULTIPLIED BY (q + 1)  // If remainder exists, return adjusted value
    ELSE
        RETURN n                     // If no remainder, return original value

// Main program starts here
READ inputs n, m, s FROM standard input  // Get three integer values from input
SET result1 TO mc(n, s)                   // Call mc function with n and s
SET result2 TO mc(m, s)                   // Call mc function with m and s
PRINT result1 MULTIPLIED BY result2        // Output the product of both results
```

**Assumptions:**
1. Variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers (positive or zero).
2. The function `mc` takes two integer arguments and returns an integer.
3. Input is provided in the proper format as per the main program's expectations.

This pseudocode effectively captures the logic of the original code while remaining clear and structured. Each component of the code is expressed in a straightforward manner.
