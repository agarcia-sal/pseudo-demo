**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a function named 'mc' that takes two inputs: 'n' (a number) and 's' (a divisor).**
   - Calculate the quotient and remainder when 'n' is divided by 's'.
     - The quotient is how many times 's' can fully divide into 'n'.
     - The remainder is what is left over after this division.
   - If the remainder is greater than zero:
     - Return the product of the remainder and the sum of the quotient plus one.
   - Otherwise:
     - Return the original number 'n'.

2. **Read a line of input and split it into three values, converting them to integers: 'n', 'm', and 's'.**

3. **Calculate the result by multiplying the output of 'mc' when called with 'n' and 's' with the output of 'mc' when called with 'm' and 's'.**

4. **Print the final result.** 

**Input Requirements:**
- The input consists of three integers: 'n', 'm', and 's'.

**Output Requirements:**
- The output is a single number which is the product of the results from the function 'mc' applied to 'n' and 'm' with 's' as the divisor.
