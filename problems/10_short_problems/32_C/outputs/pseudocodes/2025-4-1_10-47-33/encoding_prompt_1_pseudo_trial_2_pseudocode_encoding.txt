**Pseudocode:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - Define a function called `calculateRemainderBonus` that takes two parameters: `number` and `stepSize`.
     - Within the function:
       - Calculate how many full groups of `stepSize` fit into `number`, storing the result in `fullGroups`.
       - Calculate the remainder when `number` is divided by `stepSize`, storing the result in `remainder`.
       - If `remainder` is greater than 0, return the product of `remainder` and (`fullGroups` + 1).
       - Otherwise, return `number` itself.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - Read a single line of input containing three integers: `firstNumber`, `secondNumber`, and `stepSize`.
   - Split the input line into three separate integers.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - Call the function `calculateRemainderBonus` with `firstNumber` and `stepSize`, storing the result in `firstResult`.
   - Call the function `calculateRemainderBonus` with `secondNumber` and `stepSize`, storing the result in `secondResult`.
   - Multiply `firstResult` by `secondResult` and print the final result.

4. **End of Pseudocode.**

This pseudocode outlines the logic of dividing numbers into groups based on a specified step size and determining bonuses based on the remainders. It processes input, performs calculations through a defined function, and outputs the final multiplied result.
