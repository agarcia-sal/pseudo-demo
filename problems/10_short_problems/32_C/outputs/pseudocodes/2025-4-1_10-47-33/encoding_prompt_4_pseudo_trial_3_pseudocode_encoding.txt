```
FUNCTION mc(number, divisor)
    DIVIDE number by divisor to get quotient and remainder
    IF remainder is greater than 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

READ n, m, s FROM input
CALCULATE result1 AS mc(n, s)
CALCULATE result2 AS mc(m, s)
PRINT result1 multiplied by result2
``` 

**Comments:**
1. The `mc` function calculates a specific value based on the division of a number by a divisor.
2. The main part reads three integers (n, m, s) and uses the `mc` function to calculate two results, then prints their product.
