Here's the high-level pseudocode that accurately represents the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read input integers for total items and size of each bucket
    SET total_items, bucket_capacity, divisor TO READ_INTS_FROM_INPUT

    // Calculate the product of the results from two calls to the mc function
    SET result TO CALL mc(total_items, divisor) * CALL mc(bucket_capacity, divisor)
    
    // Output the result
    PRINT result
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION mc(number_of_items, bucket_size)
    // Calculate how many full buckets and leftover items 
    SET full_buckets, leftover_items TO DIVIDE number_of_items BY bucket_size
    
    // If there are any leftover items, calculate the total items to account for them
    IF leftover_items > 0 THEN
        RETURN leftover_items * (full_buckets + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number_of_items
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Input Handling:** The main function reads integers from the input, which represent the total number of items (`n`), the number of buckets (`m`), and the bucket size (`s`).
  
2. **Functionality of `mc`:** The `mc` function calculates how many items will fit into the buckets based on the provided number of items and bucket size. If there are leftover items (items that donâ€™t completely fill up an additional bucket), it calculates an adjusted count that accounts for those leftover items. Otherwise, it simply returns the original count of items.

3. **Output:** The final result is the product of the two calls to `mc`, which is then printed.

### Context for Complexity:
- The `mc` function utilizes a division and modulus operation to determine full buckets and leftovers, which could be less intuitive for someone unfamiliar with these concepts.
- The logic for handling leftover items could also be enhanced with a brief explanation that emphasizes how it affects the count when not all items fit perfectly into buckets.
