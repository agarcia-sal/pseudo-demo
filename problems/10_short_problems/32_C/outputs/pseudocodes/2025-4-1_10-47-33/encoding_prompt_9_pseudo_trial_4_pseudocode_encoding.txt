**Purpose:** The algorithm calculates a specific value based on two input numbers, `n` and `m`, and a divisor `s`. It performs this calculation by determining how many complete groups of size `s` can be formed and uses this information to compute a product.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Function for Group Calculation:**
   - Function CalculateGroups(totalItems, groupSize):
     - Divide totalItems by groupSize to find how many complete groups can be formed (quotient).
     - Find the remainder of totalItems divided by groupSize (remainder).
     - If there is a remainder (i.e., totalItems cannot be evenly divided by groupSize):
       - Return remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1).
     - Otherwise:
       - Return totalItems.

2. **Input Data:**
   - Read three integers: totalA (representing `n`), totalB (representing `m`), and groupSize (representing `s`) from user input.

3. **Compute Group Values:**
   - Calculate the value for totalA using CalculateGroups(totalA, groupSize).
   - Calculate the value for totalB using CalculateGroups(totalB, groupSize).

4. **Calculate and Print Result:**
   - Multiply the values obtained from totalA and totalB.
   - Output the resulting product.

**Simplified Steps of the Algorithm:**
- Read three numbers from the input.
- For each number, determine how many items are in the incomplete group based on the specified group size.
- Multiply the results of the two calculations.
- Display the final product.

This pseudocode maintains clarity and effectively communicates the algorithm's logic while avoiding programming-specific syntax.
