**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateExcessItems(totalItems, segmentSize):
    DIVIDE totalItems by segmentSize to get quotient and remainder
    IF remainder is greater than zero THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient plus one)
    ELSE
        RETURN totalItems

READ totalItemsFromInput, anotherVariable, segmentSizeFromInput

resultForTotalItems = CalculateExcessItems(totalItemsFromInput, segmentSizeFromInput)
resultForAnotherVariable = CalculateExcessItems(anotherVariable, segmentSizeFromInput)

FINAL_RESULT = resultForTotalItems multiplied by resultForAnotherVariable

OUTPUT FINAL_RESULT
```

**Explanation:**

1. **CalculateExcessItems**: A function that computes how many excess items are left when dividing a total number of items into segments of a specified size. It uses integer division to find out how many full segments fit and what is left after that. If there are leftovers, it adjusts the count based on how many segments were formed.

2. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode assumes input of three integers related to total items and segment size. The second variable is read but not used in the calculation directly.

3. **Output**: The pseudocode calculates results for both input values using the `CalculateExcessItems` function and outputs the final result as the product of both calculations.
