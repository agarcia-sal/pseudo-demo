**Purpose Summary:** The code calculates a value based on two inputs, representing large quantities divided into smaller groups, and then multiplies the results of both inputs to produce a final output.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Function**: 
   - Create a function named `calculateGroups` that takes two inputs: the total quantity `totalQuantity` and the group size `groupSize`.

2. **Calculate Number of Full Groups**:
   - Use integer division to determine how many full groups can be formed from the `totalQuantity` using `groupSize`.
   - Determine the remainder when dividing `totalQuantity` by `groupSize`, which represents any additional items that don't complete a full group.

3. **Determine Effective Groups**:
   - If there is a remainder (meaning there are extra items after forming full groups):
       - Calculate the effective number of groups as the remainder multiplied by the number of full groups plus one.
   - If there is no remainder:
       - The effective number of groups is simply equal to `totalQuantity`.

4. **Main Program**:
   - Read input values for `quantity1`, `quantity2`, and `groupSize`.
   - Calculate the effective group values for both `quantity1` and `quantity2` using the `calculateGroups` function.
   - Multiply the two effective group values together.
   - Display the final result.

**Pseudocode Structure:**

```
FUNCTION calculateGroups(totalQuantity, groupSize):
    fullGroups = totalQuantity DIV groupSize      // Determine how many full groups can be formed
    remainder = totalQuantity MOD groupSize        // Find the count of extra items

    IF remainder > 0:
        RETURN remainder * (fullGroups + 1)       // Return effective groups if there are extra items
    ELSE:
        RETURN totalQuantity                        // Return total quantity if no extra items

READ quantity1, quantity2, groupSize FROM INPUT
effectiveGroups1 = calculateGroups(quantity1, groupSize)  // Calculate effective groups for quantity1
effectiveGroups2 = calculateGroups(quantity2, groupSize)  // Calculate effective groups for quantity2
finalResult = effectiveGroups1 * effectiveGroups2          // Multiply the two effective group values
PRINT finalResult                                           // Output the final result
```

**Comments/Annotations:**
- This pseudocode captures the essence of the original code by breaking down the steps into clear logical operations that can be easily understood without programming knowledge.
