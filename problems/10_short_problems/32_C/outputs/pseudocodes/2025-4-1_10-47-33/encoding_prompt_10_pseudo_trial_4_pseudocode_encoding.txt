Here's the pseudocode based on the provided Python code, following the guided steps outlined above:

```plaintext
BEGIN FUNCTION mc(n, s)
    SET q to n DIV s                 // Calculate how many full groups of size s can fit in n
    SET r to n MOD s                 // Calculate the remainder when n is divided by s
    IF r IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN      // Check if there is a remainder
        RETURN r TIMES (q PLUS 1)    // If there is a remainder, return r multiplied by (q + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n                     // If there is no remainder, return n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main Execution
SET n, m, s to input values as integers read from standard input   // Read three integers from input
SET result1 to mc(n, s)                                         // Call mc function with n and s
SET result2 to mc(m, s)                                         // Call mc function with m and s
PRINT result1 TIMES result2                                      // Print the product of the two results
```

### Breakdown of Steps
1. **Identify the Main Components:**
   - The function `mc` computes a value based on inputs `n` and `s`.
   - The main execution consists of reading input values and invoking `mc` for two different variables (`n` and `m`).

2. **Break Down Complex Elements:**
   - The operations for calculating `q` and `r` are clearly stated as division and modulo.
   - The return statement uses conditional logic to determine what to return based on the value of `r`.

3. **State Assumptions Clearly:**
   - It is assumed that `n`, `m`, and `s` are all integers and `s` is non-zero for division to be valid.
   - The values for `n` and `m` represent quantities, while `s` represents a size or group constraint.

4. **Maintain Clarity and Readability:**
   - Meaningful identifiers such as `result1` and `result2` are used to make the purpose of these variables clear.
   - Each step is described in a way that logically outlines the function's intent.

5. **Choose Appropriate Verb Tenses:**
   - Present tense is consistently used to indicate actions that take place. For example, "SET", "RETURN", and "PRINT" describe what happens now, not in the past.
