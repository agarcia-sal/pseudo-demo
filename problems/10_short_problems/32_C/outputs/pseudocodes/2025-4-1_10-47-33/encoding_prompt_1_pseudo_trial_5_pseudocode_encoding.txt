FUNCTION mc(n, s):
    // Divide n by s to find out how many full groups (q) can be formed
    // and what is the leftover (r)
    q, r = DIVIDE n BY s to get quotient (q) and remainder (r)
    
    // If there is a remainder (r is greater than 0), 
    // return the leftover multiplied by (q + 1)
    IF r > 0 THEN
        RETURN r * (q + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n // If no remainder, return n as it is

// Read input values for n, m, and s from standard input
READ n, m, s FROM input

// Calculate the product of the results from mc for both n and m
OUTPUT mc(n, s) * mc(m, s)
``` 

### Summary of the Logic:
1. The function `mc` computes a value based on two inputs, `n` and `s`. It determines how many complete groups of size `s` can be formed from `n`, and then checks if there is any leftover.
2. If there is leftover after forming complete groups, it performs a specific calculation based on that leftover. If there is no leftover, it simply returns the value `n`.
3. The main part of the program reads three integers from the input, and then calculates and outputs the product of the results from the function `mc` applied to `n` and to `m` using the same value of `s`.
