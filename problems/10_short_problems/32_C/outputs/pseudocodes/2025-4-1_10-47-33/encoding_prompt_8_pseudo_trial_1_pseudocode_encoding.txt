### Purpose
The primary goal of the code is to calculate a specific product based on two input integers, while considering a third integer as a divisor in a mathematical operation.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAndAdjustment(number, divisor):
    // Calculate quotient and remainder when dividing number by divisor
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE number BY divisor
    // If there is a remainder
    IF remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        // Return the remainder multiplied by incremented quotient
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ENDIF
    // If no remainder, return the original number
    RETURN number

// READ the input values for n, m, and s and convert them to integers
READ input values n, m, s

// Calculate the adjusted values for n and m using the helper function
adjustedValueForN = calculateRemainderAndAdjustment(n, s)
adjustedValueForM = calculateRemainderAndAdjustment(m, s)

// Compute the final result by multiplying the adjusted values for n and m
finalResult = adjustedValueForN * adjustedValueForM

// Print the final result
PRINT finalResult
```

### Annotations
- The function `calculateRemainderAndAdjustment` performs a division operation to determine how the remainder affects the output based on certain conditions.
- The overall workflow involves reading user input, processing it to determine adjusted values based on a divisor, and then computing the product of these adjustments.
- Each step is logically sequenced to maintain clarity and ensure straightforward understanding, emphasizing the relationships between operations and their outcomes.
