Here's the pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided code snippet in a clear and structured manner:

```
Function CalculateRemainderAndMultipleOfDivisor(number, divisor):
    // Calculate the quotient and remainder of number divided by divisor
    quotient, remainder = Divide number by divisor
    
    // If there is a remainder, return the product of remainder and (quotient + 1)
    If remainder is greater than 0:
        Return remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    Else:
        // If no remainder, return the number itself
        Return number

// Main execution starts here
Input: Read three integers from user input (n, m, s)
    // n: first number
    // m: second number
    // s: divisor

// Calculate the adjusted value for n using the CalculateRemainderAndMultipleOfDivisor function
adjustedValueForN = CalculateRemainderAndMultipleOfDivisor(n, s)

// Calculate the adjusted value for m using the same function
adjustedValueForM = CalculateRemainderAndMultipleOfDivisor(m, s)

// Calculate the final result by multiplying the two adjusted values
finalResult = adjustedValueForN multiplied by adjustedValueForM

// Output the final result
Print finalResult
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition:** The pseudocode defines a function to encapsulate the logic of computing the adjusted remainder and quotient for any given number based on the divisor.

2. **Input Handling:** It describes how inputs are obtained, clearly stating the purpose of each variable.

3. **Conditional Logic:** The use of if-else statements is explained in a straightforward manner, demonstrating how we assess the presence of a remainder.

4. **Flow of Execution:** The main part of the code executes by calling the function twice, once for each of the input numbers (n and m), and combines the results.

5. **Output:** Finally, it specifies that the output is the product of the two adjusted values.

This pseudocode summarizes the logic without requiring the reader to understand the specific programming language's syntax, focusing instead on the algorithms and their intentions.
