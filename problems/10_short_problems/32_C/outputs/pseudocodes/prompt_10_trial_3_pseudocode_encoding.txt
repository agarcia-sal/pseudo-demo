Certainly! Below is a translation of the given Python code into clear and concise pseudocode, following the structured language concepts as guided:

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
FUNCTION mc(n, s)
    SET q TO n DIVIDED BY s  // Calculate the quotient
    SET r TO n MODULO s      // Calculate the remainder
    IF r > 0 THEN
        RETURN r MULTIPLIED BY (q + 1)  // If remainder is positive, calculate and return
    ELSE
        RETURN n               // If remainder is zero, return n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main Execution Block
READ n, m, s FROM INPUT  // Read integer values for n, m, and s
SET result1 TO mc(n, s)  // Call mc function with n and s
SET result2 TO mc(m, s)  // Call mc function with m and s
PRINT result1 MULTIPLIED BY result2  // Output the product of the results
```

**Assumptions:**
1. `n`, `m`, and `s` are all integers and `s` is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero.
2. The `PRINT` function outputs the final result to the standard output.

**Explanation of Main Components:**
- The `mc` function calculates either the adjusted value of `n` or simply returns `n`, based on the provided conditions.
- The main block reads input values and invokes the `mc` function twice, once for `n` and once for `m`, and finally prints the product of both results.
