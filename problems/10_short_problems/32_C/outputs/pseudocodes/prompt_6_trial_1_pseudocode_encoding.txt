Here is the translated pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided code clearly and understandably:

```
FUNCTION calculate_remainder(n, s):
    // This function takes two numbers, n (total amount) and s (size), 
    // and calculates how many complete groups of size s can fit into n,
    // then determines the total needed based on whether there is a remainder.
    
    number_of_complete_groups, remainder = DIVIDE n BY s
    IF remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder MULTIPLIED BY (number_of_complete_groups + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n

// Read inputs for total_n (total first amount), total_m (total second amount), size_s (size)
READ total_n, total_m, size_s FROM USER INPUT

// Calculate the adjusted totals for both inputs using the size parameter
adjusted_total_n = calculate_remainder(total_n, size_s)
adjusted_total_m = calculate_remainder(total_m, size_s)

// Output the product of the adjusted totals
PRINT adjusted_total_n MULTIPLIED BY adjusted_total_m
```

### Explanation:
1. **Functions and Variables**: The pseudocode defines a function to calculate the adjusted values based on the given size. Variables are descriptively named for clarity.
2. **Control Structures**: Loops or conditionals are articulated plainly to showcase the decision-making in the code.
3. **Inputs and Outputs**: Input operations and the final output are clearly specified, ensuring an understanding of the program's flow.
4. **Comments**: Comments are included to explain both the purpose of functions and specific logical steps, enhancing readability.
