**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION mc(n, s)
    SET q TO n DIVIDED BY s
    SET r TO n MODULO s

    IF r GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN r MULTIPLIED BY (q + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

BEGIN MAIN
    // Read input values for n, m, and s
    READ n, m, s FROM standard input

    // Calculate and print the product of mc(n, s) and mc(m, s)
    SET result1 TO mc(n, s)
    SET result2 TO mc(m, s)
    PRINT result1 MULTIPLIED BY result2
END MAIN
```

### Breakdown of Steps:
1. **Main Components:**
   - The function `mc(n, s)` calculates a value based on the division and modulus of `n` by `s`.
   - The main block reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `s` and prints the product of the results from calling the `mc` function with `n` and `m`.

2. **Complex Elements:**
   - The operations inside the function are broken down into multiple steps to enhance clarity (calculating `q` and `r` separately).

3. **Assumptions:**
   - The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are expected to be integers.
   - `s` is assumed to be non-zero to avoid division by zero errors.

4. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - Meaningful identifiers like `result1` and `result2` are used to describe the results of the `mc` function calls.

5. **Verb Tenses:**
   - Present tense is used throughout to reflect that actions are performed in the current context (e.g., "SET", "RETURN", "PRINT").
