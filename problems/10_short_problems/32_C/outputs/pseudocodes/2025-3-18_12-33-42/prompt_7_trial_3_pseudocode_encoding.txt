Here's a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAndMultiply(number1, number2, divisor)
    DIVIDE number1 by divisor to get quotient and remainder
    IF remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder MULTIPLIED BY (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number1
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION main()
    READ three integers from input into variables totalItems1, totalItems2, divisor
    CALL calculateRemainderAndMultiply with totalItems1 and divisor, STORE result in result1
    CALL calculateRemainderAndMultiply with totalItems2 and divisor, STORE result in result2
    PRINT result1 MULTIPLIED BY result2
END FUNCTION

CALL main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Purpose:** The `calculateRemainderAndMultiply` function computes the remainder of a given number divided by a divisor and adjusts its output based on whether there is a remainder.
2. **Input and Output:** 
   - Inputs to the `main` function are three integers read from user input.
   - Outputs are the product of the adjusted values from the two calls to `calculateRemainderAndMultiply`.
3. **Flow Structure:** The pseudocode uses clear functions and conditional statements to articulate control flow, maintaining a high-level abstraction without niche programming details. 

This structured format provides clarity and easy comprehension for readers irrespective of their programming background.
