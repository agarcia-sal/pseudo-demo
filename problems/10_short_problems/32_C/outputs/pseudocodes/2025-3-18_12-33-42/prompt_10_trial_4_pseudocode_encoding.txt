Here is the pseudocode representation of the provided Python code according to the specified steps:

```plaintext
FUNCTION mc(n, s)
    SET q TO n DIVIDED BY s
    SET r TO n MODULO s
    IF r GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN r MULTIPLIED BY (q + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n
    ENDIF
END_FUNCTION

// Main program starts here
DECLARE n, m, s AS INTEGER

// Read input values for n, m, s from user
READ n, m, s

// Calculate the result by multiplying two function calls
SET result TO (mc(n, s) MULTIPLIED BY mc(m, s))

// Print the result
PRINT result
```

### Breakdown of Steps:

1. **Main Components Identified:**
   - Function `mc(n, s)` computes a transformed value based on the inputs `n` and `s`.
   - `divmod(n, s)` is replaced by division and modulo operations.
   - The main program reads three integers and prints the product of two function invocations.

2. **Complex Elements Simplified:**
   - The function `mc` now clearly delineates the computation of `q` and `r`.
   - The conditional check and the return values are represented clearly without complex syntax.

3. **Assumptions Stated:**
   - Variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assumed to be non-negative integers.
   - The functionality of `READ` and `PRINT` assumes proper input/output mechanisms for integers.

4. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - Meaningful identifiers like `result`, `q`, and `r` are used.
   - The logic flow is easy to follow, detailing each step performed in the function and in the main program.

5. **Appropriate Verb Tenses:**
   - Present tense is used throughout to convey actions in a direct manner (`SET`, `READ`, `PRINT`, etc.).
