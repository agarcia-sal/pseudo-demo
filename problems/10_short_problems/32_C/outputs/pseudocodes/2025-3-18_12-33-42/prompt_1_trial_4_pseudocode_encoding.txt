**Pseudocode:**

Define function CalculateMaxCount(n, s):
    Divide n by s to get quotient (q) and remainder (r)
    If remainder (r) is greater than 0:
        Return remainder (r) multiplied by (quotient (q) plus 1)
    Otherwise:
        Return n

Read integers n, m, and s from input
Calculate count1 as CalculateMaxCount(n, s)
Calculate count2 as CalculateMaxCount(m, s)
Print the product of count1 and count2

**End of Pseudocode** 

This pseudocode summarizes the logic behind the given code by breaking down the steps involved in the calculation and clearly stating what each part does.
