**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to calculate a value based on two numbers and a divisor, where the final output is the product of two derived results.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a Function to Calculate Adjusted Value:**
   - Define a function named `calculate_adjusted_value` which takes two inputs: `total_items` and `group_size`.
     - Compute `full_groups` as the integer division of `total_items` by `group_size` (the number of complete groups).
     - Compute `remaining_items` as the remainder of the division of `total_items` by `group_size` (the number of items not fitting into a complete group).
     - If there are any remaining items (`remaining_items` is greater than 0):
       - Return the total amount of items that needs to be accounted for by multiplying the number of full groups by `(full_groups + 1)`, which accounts for an additional partial group.
     - If there are no remaining items:
       - Return the total number of items.

2. **Read Input Values:**
   - Accept input values for `total_items1`, `total_items2`, and `group_size` from the user.
   - Convert these input values into integers for processing.

3. **Calculate Result for Both Inputs:**
   - Call `calculate_adjusted_value` with `total_items1` and `group_size`, and assign the result to `result1`.
   - Call `calculate_adjusted_value` with `total_items2` and `group_size`, and assign the result to `result2`.

4. **Output the Final Result:**
   - Calculate the final output as the product of `result1` and `result2`.
   - Print the final output.

**Final Pseudocode Representation:**

```
FUNCTION calculate_adjusted_value(total_items, group_size)
    full_groups = total_items DIV group_size
    remaining_items = total_items MOD group_size
    
    IF remaining_items > 0 THEN
        RETURN remaining_items * (full_groups + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN total_items
    END IF
END FUNCTION

BEGIN
    READ total_items1, total_items2, group_size
    CONVERT total_items1, total_items2, group_size TO INTEGERS
    
    result1 = calculate_adjusted_value(total_items1, group_size)
    result2 = calculate_adjusted_value(total_items2, group_size)
    
    final_output = result1 * result2
    PRINT final_output
END
```
