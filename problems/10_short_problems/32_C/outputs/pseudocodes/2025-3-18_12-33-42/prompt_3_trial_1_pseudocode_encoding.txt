Hereâ€™s a structured pseudocode representation of the provided Python code, focusing on clarity and intent:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAndAdjust(value, divisor)
    DIVIDE value by divisor, store quotient in "quotient", store remainder in "remainder"
    IF remainder is greater than 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient plus 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN value
    END IF
END FUNCTION

BEGIN MAIN
    READ three integers from input as "totalValue1", "totalValue2", and "divisor"
    
    CALL calculateRemainderAndAdjust with "totalValue1" and "divisor", store result in "adjustedValue1"
    CALL calculateRemainderAndAdjust with "totalValue2" and "divisor", store result in "adjustedValue2"

    CALCULATE the product of "adjustedValue1" and "adjustedValue2"
    
    PRINT the result of the product
END MAIN
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: The function `calculateRemainderAndAdjust` captures the logic of computing how many full groups can be made (`quotient`) and handles whether to adjust based on the `remainder`.
- **Main Logic**: The main section reads input values, applies the function to both `totalValue1` and `totalValue2`, and computes their product to display the final outcome.
- **Control Structures**: Conditional statements are clearly articulated with IF-THEN statements.
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The pseudocode indicates where input is read and how results are produced and printed, maintaining clarity.

The pseudocode serves as an accessible description of the code's algorithm, facilitating understanding without reliance on specific syntax.
