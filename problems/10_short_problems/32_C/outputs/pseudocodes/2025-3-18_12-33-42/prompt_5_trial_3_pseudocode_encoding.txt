**Purpose:** The program calculates a specific outcome based on two input values, `n` and `m`, which are divided by another value `s`, altering the results based on the remainders of these divisions.

```plaintext
1. FUNCTION CalculateAdjustedValues(input1, input2, divisor)
   INPUT: input1 (n), input2 (m), divisor (s)
   OUTPUT: adjusted product of the values
   
   a. Set quotient1 and remainder1 as the result of dividing input1 by divisor
   b. If remainder1 is greater than 0:
      - Adjusted value1 = remainder1 multiplied by (quotient1 + 1)
   c. Otherwise:
      - Adjusted value1 = input1
      
   d. Set quotient2 and remainder2 as the result of dividing input2 by divisor
   e. If remainder2 is greater than 0:
      - Adjusted value2 = remainder2 multiplied by (quotient2 + 1)
   f. Otherwise:
      - Adjusted value2 = input2
      
   g. RETURN the product of Adjusted value1 and Adjusted value2
END FUNCTION

2. READ input values from the user (n, m, s)
   - Split the input string and convert each piece to a number
   
3. CALL CalculateAdjustedValues(n, m, s) and PRINT the result
```

**Comments and Annotations:**
- Step 1 defines a function to handle the main logic, taking three inputs representing the two values to be adjusted (n and m) and a divisor (s).
- The division results in a quotient and a remainder, which are used to determine how to adjust the output values.
- The product of the adjusted results is finally printed, which provides the final outcome based on the input values.

**Example Structures:**
- This pseudocode is structured to clearly separate different functional parts, which enhances readability. Each step is informative and avoids programming-specific terminology, making it accessible to a broader audience.

**Iterate for Improvement:**
- Review the pseudocode to ensure that it maintains a clear flow of logic while adequately describing each operation without unnecessary complexity. Adjust any ambiguous language for improved clarity where needed.
