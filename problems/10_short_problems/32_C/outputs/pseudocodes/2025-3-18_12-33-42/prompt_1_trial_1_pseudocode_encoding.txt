**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a function named 'calculate_remainder_adjusted' that takes two inputs:**
   - 'total' (an integer representing the total amount)
   - 'size' (an integer representing the size for division)

   **Inside the function:**
   - Divide 'total' by 'size' to get:
     - 'quotient' (the number of full groups)
     - 'remainder' (the leftover amount after forming full groups)
   - If 'remainder' is greater than zero:
     - Return 'remainder' multiplied by ('quotient' + 1) (this represents the adjusted value for when there is a leftover)
   - Otherwise (when remainder is zero):
     - Return 'total' (this means no adjustment is needed)

2. **Read a line of input and convert it into three integers:**
   - 'n' (total amount 1)
   - 'm' (total amount 2)
   - 's' (size for division)

3. **Calculate the adjusted values for 'n' and 'm' by calling the function:**
   - 'adjusted_value_n' = calculate_remainder_adjusted(n, s)
   - 'adjusted_value_m' = calculate_remainder_adjusted(m, s)

4. **Print the product of 'adjusted_value_n' and 'adjusted_value_m':**
   - Output the result of multiplying 'adjusted_value_n' by 'adjusted_value_m' 

**Input:**
- A line with three integers separated by spaces (n, m, s).

**Output:**
- A single integer that represents the product of the adjusted values for 'n' and 'm' based on the given size 's'.
