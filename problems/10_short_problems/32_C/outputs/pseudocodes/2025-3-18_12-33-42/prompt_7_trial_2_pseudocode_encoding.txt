Here is the high-level pseudocode that accurately describes the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAndAdjust(quantity, divisor)
    // Calculate how many full sets of 'divisor' fit into 'quantity'
    SET fullSetsCount, remainder = DIVIDE quantity BY divisor
    
    // If there is a remainder, adjust the result
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (fullSetsCount + 1) // Adjust for the partial set
    ELSE
        RETURN quantity // No adjustment needed
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main program begins here
INITIALIZE quantityN, quantityM, divisorS FROM input // Read values for n, m, and s
// Calculate adjusted results for both quantities
SET adjustedResultN = calculateRemainderAndAdjust(quantityN, divisorS)
SET adjustedResultM = calculateRemainderAndAdjust(quantityM, divisorS)

// Output the product of the two adjusted results
PRINT adjustedResultN * adjustedResultM
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition:** The function `calculateRemainderAndAdjust(quantity, divisor)` computes how much needs to be considered if there is a partial (leftover) quantity when splitting into equal divisions defined by `divisor`. If there is no remainder, it simply returns the original quantity.

2. **Input Handling:** The program begins by reading values for `quantityN`, `quantityM`, and `divisorS`, which correspond to the input integers expected by the original code.

3. **Calculation and Output:** It calculates adjusted results for both input quantities by calling the defined function and then prints the product of these two adjusted results.

This structured approach clarifies the logic of the original code while ensuring that it is easy to follow for someone without a programming background.
