**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start of the Program**
   
2. **Define a Function**: 
   - Name the function "CalculateRemainderAdjustedTotal" which takes two parameters: "totalItems" and "groupSize".

3. **Inside the Function**:
   - Divide "totalItems" by "groupSize" to determine how many full groups can be formed. Store this in a variable called "fullGroups".
   - Find the remainder of items that do not fit into full groups. Store this in a variable called "remainingItems".
   - If there are any "remainingItems" (i.e., if "remainingItems" is greater than zero):
       - Return the product of "remainingItems" and one added to "fullGroups".
   - Otherwise, return the original "totalItems".

4. **Read Input Values**: 
   - Get three integers from the user input: "totalItemsN", "totalItemsM", and "groupSizeS".

5. **Calculate**: 
   - Call the function "CalculateRemainderAdjustedTotal" with "totalItemsN" and "groupSizeS". Store the result in a variable called "adjustedTotalN".
   - Call the function "CalculateRemainderAdjustedTotal" with "totalItemsM" and "groupSizeS". Store the result in a variable called "adjustedTotalM".

6. **Output the Result**: 
   - Multiply "adjustedTotalN" by "adjustedTotalM" and display this final result.

7. **End of the Program**
