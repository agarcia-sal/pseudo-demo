Hereâ€™s the translation of the provided code into a clear and concise pseudocode format, following the guided steps:

### Pseudocode

**Function mc(n, s)**  
1. **Input:**  
   - n: integer representing the first number  
   - s: integer representing the second number  

2. **Process:**  
   - Set q to the result of the integer division of n by s  
   - Set r to the remainder of the division of n by s  
   - If r is greater than 0, then  
     - Return r multiplied by (q + 1)  
   - Otherwise,  
     - Return n  

**Main Program**  
1. **Input:**  
   - Read values n, m, s as integers from user input  

2. **Output:**  
   - Calculate result1 as mc(n, s)  
   - Calculate result2 as mc(m, s)  
   - Print the product of result1 and result2  

### Assumptions
- All input values (n, m, s) are assumed to be non-negative integers.
- The function mc handles cases when s is not zero.

### Clarification of Steps
- The `mc` function takes two parameters and either computes a modified value based on division or returns the original value. 
- The main program collects input values, computes the results through function calls, and prints the final outcome.
