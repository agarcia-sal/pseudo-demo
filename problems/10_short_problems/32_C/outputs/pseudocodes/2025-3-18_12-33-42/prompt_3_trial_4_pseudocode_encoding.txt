Here is the pseudocode based on the provided code snippet:

```
FUNCTION mc(number, size):
    // Divide the number into quotient and remainder when divided by size
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE number BY size
    IF remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        // If there is a remainder, calculate and return the total considering the extra portion
        RETURN remainder MULTIPLIED BY (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        // If no remainder, return the original number
        RETURN number

// Read input values for n, m, and s
READ n, m, s FROM input

// Calculate the product of the results from mc function for n and m, and print the result
PRINT (mc(n, s) MULTIPLIED BY mc(m, s))
```

### Breakdown of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function mc**:
   - Takes two parameters: `number` (n or m) and `size` (s).
   - Computes the quotient and remainder of `number` divided by `size` and checks if there is any remainder.
   - Returns either a calculated value based on the remainder or the original number.

2. **Input Section**:
   - Reads multiple integers from the input, specifically `n`, `m`, and `s`, allowing for further calculations.

3. **Output Section**:
   - Calls the `mc` function with `n` and `m` and multiplies their results before printing the final output.

This structure prioritizes clarity, ensuring someone without a prior understanding of the original code can still follow the logic.
