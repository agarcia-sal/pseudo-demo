Here is the translated high-level pseudocode based on the provided code:

```
FUNCTION calculateTotalPages(totalItems, itemsPerPage)
    INITIALIZE quotient and remainder as the result of dividing totalItems by itemsPerPage
    IF remainder is greater than 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient plus 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN totalItems
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION main()
    READ totalItems, additionalItems, itemsPerPage from input
    SET pagesForTotalItems to the result of calculateTotalPages(totalItems, itemsPerPage)
    SET pagesForAdditionalItems to the result of calculateTotalPages(additionalItems, itemsPerPage)
    PRINT the product of pagesForTotalItems and pagesForAdditionalItems
END FUNCTION
```

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

1. **calculateTotalPages Function:** This function determines how many pages are needed to accommodate a specified number of items when displaying a certain number of items per page. If there are any remaining items that do not completely fill a page, it accounts for them by adding an extra page.

2. **main Function:** This function handles the input reading, invoking the `calculateTotalPages` function for both the total number of items and any additional items. It then multiplies the results, representing the total pages required to display both sets of items collectively.

3. **Input/Output Context:** The code expects three integer inputs from the user: `totalItems`, `additionalItems`, and `itemsPerPage`. The output is the product of the number of pages calculated for both the total and additional items.

The pseudocode maintains a high-level abstraction while clearly outlining the logical flow and purpose of each component, ensuring it is accessible to readers of varying expertise levels.
