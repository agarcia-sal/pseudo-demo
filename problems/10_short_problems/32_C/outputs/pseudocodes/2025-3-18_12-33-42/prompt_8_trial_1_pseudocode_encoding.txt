**Objective:** The purpose of this code is to calculate a product based on the number of items (n and m) that need to be divided into groups of a specified size (s) and to manage any remainders.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define Function for Group Calculation:**
   - Function Name: CalculateGroups
   - Input: TotalItems (number of items), GroupSize
   - Output: TotalGroups (total number of groups, taking remnant items into account)
   - Begin Function CalculateGroups
     - Divide TotalItems by GroupSize, resulting in Quotient (q) and Remainder (r)
     - If Remainder (r) is greater than zero:
       - Return TotalGroups as (r times (q plus 1)) 
     - Else:
       - Return TotalGroups as TotalItems
   - End Function

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - Read input values from the user: TotalItemsA (n), TotalItemsB (m), and GroupSize (s)
   - Convert user input values into integers
   - Calculate the total groups for TotalItemsA by calling CalculateGroups with TotalItemsA and GroupSize
   - Calculate the total groups for TotalItemsB by calling CalculateGroups with TotalItemsB and GroupSize
   - Multiply the results of both group calculations
   - Print the final result

**Detailed Steps of Main Program:**
- Start reading a line of input
- Split the input line into three separate values and convert them to integers:
  - TotalItemsA gets the first value (n)
  - TotalItemsB gets the second value (m)
  - GroupSize gets the third value (s)
- Call CalculateGroups function with TotalItemsA and GroupSize, assign to GroupsA
- Call CalculateGroups function with TotalItemsB and GroupSize, assign to GroupsB
- Calculate FinalResult by multiplying GroupsA and GroupsB
- Display the FinalResult to the user

**Example Comment for Clarity:**
- The CalculateGroups function handles grouping logic, ensuring that any items leftover after division are accounted for in an additional group. 

This pseudocode keeps the original logic intact while utilizing clear names and simplified descriptions of operations, making it accessible for readers unfamiliar with programming syntax.
