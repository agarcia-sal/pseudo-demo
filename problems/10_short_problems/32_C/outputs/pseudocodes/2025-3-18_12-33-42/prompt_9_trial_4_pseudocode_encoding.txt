**Purpose:** The goal of the algorithm is to calculate a specific product based on two input numbers, adjusting for given constraints using a mathematical operation.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define the function called "calculate_adjustment" which takes in two parameters:**
   - total_items (representing n)
   - group_size (representing s)

2. **Inside the function:**
   - Determine how many complete groups can be formed from total_items by dividing total_items by group_size. 
     - Store the result in a variable called full_groups.
   - Calculate the remainder when total_items is divided by group_size which indicates leftover items.
     - Store this in a variable named leftover_items.
   - If there are leftover_items:
     - Return the total_items adjusted by the formula: leftover_items multiplied by (full_groups + 1).
   - Otherwise:
     - Return total_items without any adjustment.

3. **Read input values for the total number of items (n), another total number of items (m), and the group size (s).**
   - Convert these from strings to integers.

4. **Calculate adjusted values for the first set of items (n) using the calculate_adjustment function.**
   - Store this result in a variable called adjusted_value_n.

5. **Calculate adjusted values for the second total of items (m) using the same calculate_adjustment function.**
   - Store this result in a variable called adjusted_value_m.

6. **Calculate the final product of adjusted_value_n and adjusted_value_m.**

7. **Print the final product as the output.**

**Input/Output Clarification:**
- **Input:** The program receives a single line containing three integers (n, m, s).
- **Output:** The program outputs a single integer which is the product of the adjusted values based on the input numbers and the group size.

**Final Review:**
The pseudocode clearly outlines the logical flow and operations while avoiding any specific programming syntax. The use of descriptive names aids in understanding the purpose of each step without requiring knowledge of the original code's syntax. Each major operation has been broken down into straightforward processes, ensuring coherence and clarity throughout.
