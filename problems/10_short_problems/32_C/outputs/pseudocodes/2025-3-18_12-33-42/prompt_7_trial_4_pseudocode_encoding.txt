Certainly! Below is the high-level pseudocode that accurately describes the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainder(n, s)
    DIVIDE n by s to get quotient q and remainder r
    IF r is greater than 0 THEN
        RETURN r multiplied by (q + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION main()
    READ input values for n, m, s from standard input
    INITIALIZE result as the product of calculateRemainder(n, s) and calculateRemainder(m, s)
    PRINT result
END FUNCTION

CALL main()
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **calculateRemainder Function:**
   - This function takes two integers `n` and `s` as parameters.
   - It determines how many full groups of size `s` can be made from `n` (the quotient `q`) and what's left over (the remainder `r`).
   - If there is any remainder (`r > 0`), it calculates a value based on `r` and `q`, otherwise, it simply returns `n`.

2. **main Function:**
   - This function handles reading input values.
   - It computes results using the `calculateRemainder` function twice, once for each of `n` and `m`, and multiplies the results. 
   - Finally, it prints the resulting product.

3. **Overall Flow:**
   - The execution starts with calling the `main` function, ensuring organized entry into the program's logic.

This pseudocode maintains a high-level abstraction and clearly represents the original code's intent and operations.
