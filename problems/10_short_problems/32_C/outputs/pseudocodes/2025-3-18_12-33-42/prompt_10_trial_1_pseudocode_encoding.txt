Here is the pseudocode translated from the given Python code, following the structured language concepts as outlined in your steps:

```
FUNCTION mc(n, s)
    SET q AS INTEGER
    SET r AS INTEGER
    // Calculate quotient and remainder from dividing n by s
    SET q, r = DIVIDE n BY s
    // If there is a remainder, return the product of remainder and incremented quotient
    IF r > 0 THEN
        RETURN r * (q + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Read inputs for n, m, and s
SET n, m, s AS LIST OF INTEGER FROM INPUT

// Calculate and output the product of mc(n, s) and mc(m, s)
PRINT mc(n, s) * mc(m, s)
```

### Breakdown of Main Components:
1. **Function Definition:**
   - `FUNCTION mc(n, s)`: Defines a function that takes two integer inputs.
   
2. **Variables:**
   - `q` and `r`: Store the quotient and remainder from the division of `n` by `s`.

3. **Conditional Statement:**
   - `IF r > 0`: Checks if there is a remainder and returns a calculated value or `n` based on that condition.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - `SET n, m, s AS LIST OF INTEGER FROM INPUT`: Captures multiple integer inputs in a single line.

5. **Output Statement:**
   - `PRINT mc(n, s) * mc(m, s)`: Outputs the product of the results from the function calls.

### Assumptions:
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assumed to be positive integers.
- The input is provided in a format that can be split into three integers. 

This pseudocode maintains clarity and detail while avoiding coding jargon, presenting a logical flow of the program as described in the original code.
