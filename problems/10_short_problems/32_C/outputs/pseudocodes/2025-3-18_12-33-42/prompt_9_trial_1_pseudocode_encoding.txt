**Purpose:** This algorithm calculates the product of two adjusted numbers based on a specified group size.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define the function to adjust a number:**
   - Function `adjust_number(total_items, group_size)`:
     - Calculate how many complete groups can be formed from `total_items` by dividing `total_items` by `group_size`.
     - Calculate the remainder when `total_items` is divided by `group_size`.
     - If there is a remainder:
       - Return the remainder multiplied by one more than the number of complete groups.
     - Otherwise:
       - Return `total_items` as is.

2. **Input:**
   - Read three integers from the user: `total_items1`, `total_items2`, and `group_size`.

3. **Process:**
   - Call `adjust_number` with `total_items1` and `group_size`, storing the result in `adjusted_value1`.
   - Call `adjust_number` with `total_items2` and `group_size`, storing the result in `adjusted_value2`.

4. **Output:**
   - Calculate the product of `adjusted_value1` and `adjusted_value2`.
   - Print the final product.

**Pseudocode Implementation:**

```
FUNCTION adjust_number(total_items, group_size)
    COMPLETE_GROUPS = total_items DIVIDED BY group_size
    REMAINDER = total_items MODULO group_size
    
    IF REMAINDER IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN REMAINDER MULTIPLIED BY (COMPLETE_GROUPS + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN total_items

START
    READ total_items1, total_items2, group_size FROM USER INPUT
    adjusted_value1 = adjust_number(total_items1, group_size)
    adjusted_value2 = adjust_number(total_items2, group_size)
    
    FINAL_PRODUCT = adjusted_value1 MULTIPLIED BY adjusted_value2
    PRINT FINAL_PRODUCT
END
``` 

**Final Notes:**
- This pseudocode reflects the original algorithm's logic while remaining easy to read and understand.
- Each part has been broken down into simple operations and descriptive names have been used to make the terminology clear for all readers.
