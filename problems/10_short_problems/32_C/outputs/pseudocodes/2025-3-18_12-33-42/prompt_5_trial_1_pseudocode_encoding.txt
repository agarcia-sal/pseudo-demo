**Purpose Statement:**  
This program calculates a value based on two integers and a divisor, which represents a grouping of units. It uses a helper function to determine how many complete groups can be formed and the remainder, ultimately multiplying the results of two separate calculations.

---

### Pseudocode:

**FUNCTION mc(number, divisor)**
1. **Calculate the number of complete groups:**  
   - Divide `number` by `divisor`, storing the quotient in `completeGroups` and the remainder in `remainder`.
   
2. **Determine the effective size of the last group:**  
   - If `remainder` is greater than zero:
     - Return `remainder` multiplied by `completeGroups + 1` (this accounts for the non-full group).
   - Otherwise:
     - Return `number` (meaning it fits exactly into the groups).

**END FUNCTION**

**MAIN FUNCTION**
1. **Read input values:**  
   - Accept a line of input containing three integers: `n` (first quantity), `m` (second quantity), and `s` (the grouping divisor).

2. **Calculate values using mc function:**   
   - Call `mc` with `n` and `s`, storing the result in `result1`.
   - Call `mc` with `m` and `s`, storing the result in `result2`.

3. **Calculate final output:**  
   - Multiply `result1` by `result2` to get the final value.

4. **Display the final result.**

**END MAIN FUNCTION**

### Comments for Clarity:
- The **mc** function computes how many full groups can be formed from a number and calculates the contribution of any remaining units.
- The main function orchestrates obtaining inputs, computing results using the mc function, and displaying the final outcome, which combines the two independent calculations.

### Example Input/Output:
- **Input:** 10 5 3 (where 10 is n, 5 is m, and 3 is s)
- **Output:** The program will print a product based on the results from the mc function applied to n and m. 

This pseudocode provides a clear, structured overview of the process, making it accessible to readers regardless of their programming background.
