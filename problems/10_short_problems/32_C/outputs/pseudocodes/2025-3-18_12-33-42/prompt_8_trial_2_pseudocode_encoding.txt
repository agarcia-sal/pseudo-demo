**Purpose**: The code calculates a specific value based on the input values `n`, `m`, and `s` by employing a helper function to manage division and remainder operations, and then multiplies the results of this function for `n` and `m`.

### Pseudocode

```
BEGIN

    // Function to calculate the desired result based on input number and size
    FUNCTION calculateValue(total, size):
        // Divide total by size to get the quotient and remainder
        quotient, remainder = DIVIDE total BY size
        
        // If there is a remainder, calculate a certain value
        IF remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
            RETURN remainder TIMES (quotient + 1)
        ELSE
            RETURN total // If there is no remainder, return total as is

    // Main program execution starts here
    READ integers n, m, s FROM user input
    
    // Call the function for both n and m and multiply the results
    result = calculateValue(n, s) TIMES calculateValue(m, s)

    // Output the final result
    PRINT result

END
```

### Explanation of the Logic:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `calculateValue(total, size)` function calculates a specific value by dividing `total` by `size`.
   - It checks for a remainder. If there is a remainder (i.e., the division isn't exact), it computes a specific value using the quotient plus one.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program captures three integers from user input: `n`, `m`, and `s`.

3. **Calculation and Output**:
   - The program calls the `calculateValue` function twice: once with `n` and once with `m`, then multiplies these two results together.
   - Finally, it prints the result of this multiplication.

### Comments:
- In the `calculateValue` function, the use of division and remainder helps adjust the computations based on how `total` splits into segments of size `size`.
- The multiplication of the two results reflects an application of this logic to two separate input values, combining their results into a single output.
