**Purpose Summary**: The goal of this code is to calculate a modified product of two numbers based on a specified divisor, ensuring that certain adjustments are made to the values based on how they divide by this divisor.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION calculateModifiedProduct(number1, number2, divisor):
    // Calculate how many full sets of 'divisor' can fit into 'number1' and any remainder
    fullSets1, remainder1 = DIVIDE number1 BY divisor
    // If there is a remainder, slightly adjust the value based on its full sets
    IF remainder1 > 0 THEN
        adjustedValue1 = remainder1 * (fullSets1 + 1)
    ELSE
        adjustedValue1 = number1
    END IF

    // Repeat the same process for 'number2'
    fullSets2, remainder2 = DIVIDE number2 BY divisor
    IF remainder2 > 0 THEN
        adjustedValue2 = remainder2 * (fullSets2 + 1)
    ELSE
        adjustedValue2 = number2
    END IF

    // Return the product of the two adjusted values
    RETURN adjustedValue1 * adjustedValue2
END FUNCTION

// Main Execution
READ three integers from input: total1, total2, divisor   // Reading inputs
PRINT calculateModifiedProduct(total1, total2, divisor)   // Output the result
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Function Definition**: A function named `calculateModifiedProduct` is defined to encapsulate the logic for computing the product of the adjusted values of two numbers based on a divisor.
  
2. **Division and Remainder Calculation**: For each input number, it calculates how many full sets of `divisor` can fit into the number and any remainder left over. This is done through a division operation.

3. **Remainder Handling**: If there is a remainder for either number, the function adjusts that number's contribution to the final product by multiplying the remainder by the total sets plus one. If there is no remainder, the original number is used.

4. **Product Calculation**: Finally, the function returns the product of the two adjusted values.

5. **Input Reading and Output**: The code reads three integers from the user input and prints the result of the `calculateModifiedProduct` function.

This approach simplifies the operations performed in the original code and presents them in an accessible format, making it easy to understand without prior programming knowledge.
