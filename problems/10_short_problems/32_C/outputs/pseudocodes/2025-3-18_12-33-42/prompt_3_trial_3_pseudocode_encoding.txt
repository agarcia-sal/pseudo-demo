Here's the pseudocode based on the provided code snippet:

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read input values
    SET inputValues TO read input from standard input
    SET totalItems TO inputValues[0]  // This is 'n'
    SET otherItems TO inputValues[1]   // This is 'm'
    SET segmentSize TO inputValues[2]   // This is 's'

    // Calculate and print the product
    SET result TO calculateProduct(totalItems, otherItems, segmentSize)
    PRINT result
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateProduct(totalCount, additionalCount, segmentSize)
    // Calculate the segments required for totalCount
    SET totalSegments TO calculateSegments(totalCount, segmentSize)

    // Calculate the segments required for additionalCount
    SET additionalSegments TO calculateSegments(additionalCount, segmentSize)

    // Return the product of segments
    RETURN totalSegments * additionalSegments
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateSegments(itemCount, segmentSize)
    // Divide itemCount into full segments and get remainder
    SET quotient, remainder TO divide itemCount by segmentSize

    // Calculate the segments based on the remainder
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1) // Includes the partial segment
    ELSE
        RETURN itemCount // No partial segment needed
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation:
- The `main` function orchestrates reading the input values and initiates the process to compute the final result.
- The `calculateProduct` function computes the product of segments required for both `totalItems` and `additionalItems` using the `calculateSegments` function.
- The `calculateSegments` function encapsulates the logic for determining how many segments are needed based on the total count of items and the segment size, following the rules set out by the original code. 
- Conditional logic is clearly defined, making it easy to understand the flow without relying on specific programming constructs.
