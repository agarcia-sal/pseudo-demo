**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a function named calculate_remainder_adjusted_count which accepts two parameters: total_items and group_size.**
   - Calculate quotient and remainder when total_items is divided by group_size.
   - If the remainder is greater than zero,
     - Return the product of the remainder and the increment of the quotient by one.
   - Otherwise,
     - Return total_items.

2. **Read input values for total_items_n, total_items_m, and group_size from the user.**

3. **Call calculate_remainder_adjusted_count for total_items_n and group_size, store the result in count_n.**

4. **Call calculate_remainder_adjusted_count for total_items_m and group_size, store the result in count_m.**

5. **Calculate the final result as the product of count_n and count_m.**

6. **Output the final result.**

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```
FUNCTION calculate_remainder_adjusted_count(total_items, group_size)
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE(total_items BY group_size
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN total_items

END FUNCTION

READ total_items_n, total_items_m, group_size FROM USER INPUT

count_n = CALL calculate_remainder_adjusted_count(total_items_n, group_size)
count_m = CALL calculate_remainder_adjusted_count(total_items_m, group_size)

final_result = count_n * count_m

PRINT final_result
``` 

This high-level pseudocode captures the key logic of the original code, detailing the functions and processes without being tied to the specific syntax of any programming language.
