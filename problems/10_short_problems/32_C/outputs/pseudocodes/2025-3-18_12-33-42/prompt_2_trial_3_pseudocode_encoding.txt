**Pseudocode**

1. **Define the function mc that takes the following parameters:**
   - Total number of items (n)
   - Size of each group (s)

2. **Inside the function:**
   - Calculate how many complete groups can be formed by dividing the total number of items (n) by the size of each group (s).
   - Calculate the remainder when dividing total items (n) by the size of each group (s).
   - If there is a remainder (more items than can fit in complete groups), then return the product of the remainder and the total number of complete groups plus one (to account for an additional group of leftover items).
   - If there is no remainder, return the total number of items (n) as all items can be perfectly grouped.

3. **Read input values:**
   - Get three integers from user input: the total number of items in the first category (n), the total number of items in the second category (m), and the size of each group (s).

4. **Calculate and print the result:**
   - Call the function mc with n and s to calculate the grouping result for the first category.
   - Call the function mc with m and s to calculate the grouping result for the second category.
   - Multiply these two results together and display the final output.
