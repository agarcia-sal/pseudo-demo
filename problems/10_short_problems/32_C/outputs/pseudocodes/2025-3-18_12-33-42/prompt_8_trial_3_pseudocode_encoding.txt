**Purpose Summary**: The code calculates a product based on two input values, adjusting them using a specific division and remainder logic, before printing the final result.

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION calculateAdjustedValue(number, divisor):
    // Calculate how many times the divisor fits into the number and the remainder
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE number BY divisor
    // If there is a remainder, return the product of the remainder and (quotient + 1)
    IF remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number

// Read three integers from input
READ integers n, m, s FROM USER INPUT

// Calculate adjusted values for n and m based on the divisor s
adjustedValueForN = calculateAdjustedValue(n, s)
adjustedValueForM = calculateAdjustedValue(m, s)

// Calculate and print the final product of the two adjusted values
PRINT adjustedValueForN * adjustedValueForM
```

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The function `calculateAdjustedValue` handles the logic of adjusting the input values based on the division by `s`.
- The main section of the pseudocode handles user input and uses the function to compute and print the result.
- The use of division and checking for a remainder is crucial to determine how to adjust the values before multiplication.
