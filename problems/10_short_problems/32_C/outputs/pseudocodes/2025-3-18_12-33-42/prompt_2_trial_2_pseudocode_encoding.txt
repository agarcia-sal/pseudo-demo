**Pseudocode:**

Start by defining a function named **calculate_remainder** that takes two parameters: **total** (representing the total number of items) and **group_size** (representing the size of each group). 

Inside the function:
1. Calculate how many complete groups can be formed from the total items, storing this in a variable named **complete_groups**.
2. Calculate the remainder, which is the number of items left after forming complete groups, storing this in a variable named **remaining_items**.
3. If there are any remaining items (if remaining_items is greater than zero), return the product of **remaining_items** and the total number of complete groups plus one (as it indicates an additional partial group).
4. If there are no remaining items, simply return the total number of items.

Next, take input from the user consisting of three integers: **total_items_1**, **total_items_2**, and **group_size**. 

Compute two values using the **calculate_remainder** function:
- First, calculate the remainder for **total_items_1** using the given **group_size**.
- Then, calculate the remainder for **total_items_2** using the same **group_size**.

Finally, output the product of the two values obtained from the calculations, which represents the combined remainder calculations for both sets of items. 

End of pseudocode.
