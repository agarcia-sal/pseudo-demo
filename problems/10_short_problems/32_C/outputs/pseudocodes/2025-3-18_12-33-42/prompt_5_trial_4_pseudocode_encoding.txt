**Purpose:**  
The code calculates a specific product based on the remainders of two given numbers when divided by another number.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAdjustedValue(total, divisor):
    // Divide total by divisor and get the quotient (how many times divisor fits into total) 
    quotient, remainder = Divide total by divisor
    
    // If there is a remainder, return the adjusted value (remainder times (quotient + 1))
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1) 
    ELSE
        // If there is no remainder, return total as is
        RETURN total 

// Read three numbers from the input: total1, total2, divisor
READ total1, total2, divisor FROM input

// Calculate the adjusted values for total1 and total2 using the divisor
adjustedValue1 = calculateRemainderAdjustedValue(total1, divisor)
adjustedValue2 = calculateRemainderAdjustedValue(total2, divisor)

// Calculate and print the product of the two adjusted values
PRINT adjustedValue1 multiplied by adjustedValue2
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Function Description:**  
   The function `calculateRemainderAdjustedValue` takes a total and a divisor, divides them, and calculates an adjusted value based on whether thereâ€™s a remainder.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - **Inputs:** Three integer values are read from the input (two totals and one divisor).
   - **Outputs:** The program outputs the product of the adjusted values derived from both totals.

3. **Control Structures:**
   - The function uses a condition to check if there's a remainder from the division. If yes, it calculates a value based on that remainder; if no, it returns the original total.

4. **Overall Flow:**
   - The program first collects the necessary inputs, then computes the adjusted values for each total, and finally computes and displays their product.

**Comments:**  
Use comments in the pseudocode to explain more complex parts of operations, especially where decisions are made based on the remainder.

**Example Structures:**  
Ensure clear steps for each primary operation (computing adjusted values) and looping through the main logic by having a logical flow from reading input to output.
