Here's a clear and understandable pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAndGroups(number, groupSize):
    // Divide the number by the group size to find how many full groups fit
    fullGroups, remainder = DIVIDE(number, groupSize)
    
    // If there is any remainder, increase the count of groups by one
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (fullGroups + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Read input values for n (first number), m (second number), and s (group size)
READ n, m, s FROM INPUT

// Calculate the adjusted values for both n and m based on the group size
firstAdjustedValue = calculateRemainderAndGroups(n, s)
secondAdjustedValue = calculateRemainderAndGroups(m, s)

// Print the product of the two adjusted values
PRINT firstAdjustedValue * secondAdjustedValue
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Function Definition**: The `calculateRemainderAndGroups` function takes `number` and `groupSize` as inputs to determine how to adjust the number based on grouping logic.
2. **Calculation Logic**: It calculates how many full groups fit within the given number and checks if there's any leftover (`remainder`). If there's a remainder, it adjusts by multiplying the leftover by one more than the count of full groups.
3. **Input Reading**: The pseudocode includes steps for reading inputs from the user, where `n`, `m`, and `s` represent two numbers and the size of the group, respectively.
4. **Output**: Finally, it calculates and prints the product of the two adjusted values derived from `n` and `m`.

This pseudocode maintains clarity while representing the overall logic of the original code without getting bogged down in specific syntax or language features.
