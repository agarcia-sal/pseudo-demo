**Objective:** The primary goal of the code is to calculate a specific result based on the input values `n`, `m`, and `s`, where the function determines how many full groups can be formed from `n` and `m` items with a grouping size of `s`, adjusting for any leftover items.

---

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
Function calculateGroups(totalItems, groupSize):
    // Divide the total items into full groups and find the remainder
    fullGroups, remainder = totalItems divided by groupSize
    
    // If there's any remainder, we need to account for it by adding an extra group
    If remainder > 0:
        Return remainder multiplied by (fullGroups + 1)
    Else:
        Return totalItems // No remainder means no additional group

// Read input values for n (total items in first category), 
// m (total items in second category), and s (size of each group)
Read n, m, s from input

// Calculate the number of effective groups for both categories
Calculate effectiveGroupsForN = calculateGroups(n, s)
Calculate effectiveGroupsForM = calculateGroups(m, s)

// Output the product of effective groups for both n and m
Print the result of (effectiveGroupsForN multiplied by effectiveGroupsForM)
```

**Explanation of Components:**

- **Function `calculateGroups`**: This function takes two parameters: `totalItems` (the number of items being divided) and `groupSize` (the number of items that fit into each group). It calculates how many complete groups can be formed and accounts for any leftover items by potentially creating an additional group.
  
- **Input Handling**: The program reads a line of input containing three integers, `n`, `m`, and `s`, representing total items of two types and the size of a group.

- **Main Calculation**: It calls the `calculateGroups` function twice - once for `n` and once for `m` - to determine how many groups can be formed from each count of items. The final result is the product of the number of effective groups from both categories.

- **Output**: Finally, the program outputs the overall result, which is the product of the effective groups calculated from both inputs.

**Comments for Clarity**: Each step of the process is commented to ensure that anyone reading the pseudocode can easily follow the logic and understand what the code does without needing to refer to specific programming syntax.
