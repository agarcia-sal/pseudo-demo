**Pseudocode Summary:**

1. **Input Read**: Get three integer values:
   - `total_items`: the total number of items (n)
   - `additional_items`: the number of additional items (m)
   - `group_size`: the size of each group (s)

2. **Define Function mc**:
   - This function takes two parameters: 
     - `total_items` and 
     - `group_size`. 
   - Within the function:
     - Calculate how many complete groups can be formed with `total_items` by dividing `total_items` by `group_size`.
     - Calculate the remainder when `total_items` is divided by `group_size` to determine how many items are left after the complete groups.
     - If there are leftover items (the remainder is greater than zero):
       - Return the remainder multiplied by one plus the number of complete groups.
     - If there are no leftover items:
       - Return the total number of items as is.

3. **Main Calculation**:
   - Call the function `mc` for `total_items` using `group_size` to get the result for `n`.
   - Call the function `mc` for `additional_items` using `group_size` to get the result for `m`.
   - Multiply the results from both function calls.

4. **Output**: Display the combined result of the multiplication.
