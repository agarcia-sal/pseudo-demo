**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION compute_remainder_and_quotient(number, divisor):
    quotient, remainder = divide number by divisor
    IF remainder is greater than 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient plus 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number

BEGIN MAIN
    READ values n, m, s from input
    result_from_n = compute_remainder_and_quotient(n, s)
    result_from_m = compute_remainder_and_quotient(m, s)
    FINAL_RESULT = result_from_n multiplied by result_from_m
    PRINT FINAL_RESULT
END MAIN
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - The function `compute_remainder_and_quotient` takes two parameters: `number` and `divisor`.
   - It divides `number` by `divisor` to find the `quotient` and `remainder`.
   - If there's a remainder greater than zero, it calculates a specific value using the formula: remainder multiplied by (quotient plus one). If there's no remainder, it simply returns the original number.

2. **Main Execution**:
   - It reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `s` from the user input.
   - It calls the function twice, once for `n` and once for `m`, passing `s` as the divisor each time, and stores the results.
   - Finally, it calculates the product of the two results obtained from the function calls and prints the final result.
