```   
# Function that calculates the number of necessary elements based on total items and capacity
Function calculate_needed_elements(total_items, capacity):
    # Divide total_items by capacity to obtain quotient and remainder
    quotient, remainder = Divide total_items by capacity
    # If there is a remainder, return the product of remainder and (quotient + 1)
    If remainder is greater than 0:
        Return remainder * (quotient + 1)
    Else:
        # If no remainder, return total_items as is
        Return total_items

# Read input values for total number of items for two categories and capacity
Read input values total_items_n, total_items_m, capacity_s

# Calculate and print the product of the needed elements for both categories
Print calculate_needed_elements(total_items_n, capacity_s) * calculate_needed_elements(total_items_m, capacity_s)
