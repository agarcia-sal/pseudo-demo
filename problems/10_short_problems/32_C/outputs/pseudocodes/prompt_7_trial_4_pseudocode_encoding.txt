Below is the high-level pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION calculateRemainderAndTotal(n, s)
    // Divide n by s to get quotient and remainder
    SET quotient, remainder TO DIVIDE n BY s
    
    // If there is any remainder, calculate adjusted total
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION main()
    // Read input values for n, m, and s
    INPUT n, m, s FROM user
    
    // Calculate adjusted totals for n and m based on s
    SET adjustedTotalForN TO calculateRemainderAndTotal(n, s)
    SET adjustedTotalForM TO calculateRemainderAndTotal(m, s)
    
    // Calculate and output the product of the two totals
    OUTPUT adjustedTotalForN * adjustedTotalForM
END FUNCTION

// Start the program
CALL main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **calculateRemainderAndTotal Function**:
    - This function takes two parameters: `n` (the number) and `s` (the divisor).
    - It computes the quotient and remainder when `n` is divided by `s`.
    - If there is a remainder, it calculates a modified value based on the quotient and the remainder. If there is no remainder, it simply returns the original number `n`.

2. **main Function**:
    - This function simulates entering the program. It reads the three required numbers, `n`, `m`, and `s`, from the user.
    - It then calls the `calculateRemainderAndTotal` function for both `n` and `m` to get their respective adjusted totals.
    - Finally, it calculates the product of these two totals and outputs the result.

3. **Flow**:
    - The `main` function orchestrates the flow by gathering inputs, processing them with the helper function, and presenting the output.

This pseudocode balances clarity and detail, enabling readers to grasp the underlying logic without requiring knowledge of Python specifics.
