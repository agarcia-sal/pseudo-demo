**Purpose**: The goal of the code is to compute the product of two values derived from dividing two input numbers by a specified divisor, taking into account any remainders from the division.

**Pseudocode**:

```
FUNCTION calculateValue(number, divisor):
    # Divide the number by the divisor and get the quotient and remainder
    quotient, remainder = Divide number by divisor
    
    # If there's a remainder, return remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN number  # If no remainder, return the original number

# Read input values for the two numbers and the divisor
READ n, m, s FROM user input

# Calculate the modified values based on the user inputs
value1 = calculateValue(n, s)
value2 = calculateValue(m, s)

# Output the product of the two calculated values
PRINT value1 multiplied by value2
```

**Breakdown of Steps**:

1. **Function Definition**: Define a function that calculates a modified value based on a number and a divisor.
   - Use division to find out how the number breaks down into groups of the divisor.
   - Determine if there is a remainder when dividing.
   - If there is a remainder, modify the output to reflect that; if not, return the original number.

2. **Input Handling**: Prompt the user for three numbers which will be processed. 
   - These are the first number (`n`), the second number (`m`), and the divisor (`s`).

3. **Value Calculation**: Use the previously defined function to calculate modified values for the two numbers.

4. **Output**: Print the product of the two results from the calculations.
