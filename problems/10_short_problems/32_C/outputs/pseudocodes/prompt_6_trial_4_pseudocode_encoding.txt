Below is the pseudocode that represents the logic of the provided code in a clear and comprehensible manner.

```
FUNCTION main
    // Read three integers from input: total_amount, count, group_size
    total_amount, count, group_size = READ_INPUT_VALUES()

    // Calculate the result of two function calls and print the final output
    result = CALL calculate_adjusted_amount(total_amount, group_size) * CALL calculate_adjusted_amount(count, group_size)
    PRINT result

FUNCTION calculate_adjusted_amount(amount, group_size)
    // Divide amount by group_size, getting the quotient and remainder
    quotient, remainder = DIVIDE amount BY group_size

    // If there is a remainder, return the adjusted amount
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN amount
```

### Summary of Key Operations

1. **Input Reading**: The main function reads three integers from input, which represent the total amounts and sizes.
  
2. **Calculations**: The main function computes the product of two values obtained from the `calculate_adjusted_amount` function, which adjusts the amount based on the group size.

3. **Adjustment Logic**: In the `calculate_adjusted_amount` function:
   - The given amount is divided by the group size.
   - If there's a remainder after division, it computes a new adjusted value based on the quotient and remainder.
   - If there is no remainder, it simply returns the original amount as is.

This pseudocode avoids specific programming language syntax and focuses on the logical flow, making it easy to understand for individuals unfamiliar with the original code.
