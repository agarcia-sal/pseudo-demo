**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a function called 'calculate_remainder' that takes two numbers: total_items and group_size.**
   - Calculate the total number of complete groups by dividing total_items by group_size.
   - Determine the remaining items by finding the remainder of the division of total_items by group_size.
   - If there are remaining items (remainder is greater than zero):
     - Return the product of the number of complete groups plus one and the remainder.
   - Otherwise, return the total number of items.

2. **Read three integers from user input: total_first_group, total_second_group, and group_size.**
   This input represents:
   - total_first_group: the total number of items in the first group
   - total_second_group: the total number of items in the second group
   - group_size: the size of each group.

3. **Call the 'calculate_remainder' function with total_first_group and group_size and store the result.**
4. **Call the 'calculate_remainder' function with total_second_group and group_size and store the result.**
5. **Multiply the results from the two function calls.**

6. **Output the final result.**

In summary:
- The program calculates the adjusted total of items in two groups based on a specified group size, taking into account any overflow items, and then outputs the product of these adjusted totals.
