**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to calculate and output the product of two quantities, adjusted based on a specified grouping size.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a Function `calculateGroups`:**
    - Input: `totalItems` (the total number of items), `groupSize` (the size of each group)
    - Compute `fullGroups` by dividing `totalItems` by `groupSize`
    - Compute `remainingItems` by finding the remainder of `totalItems` when divided by `groupSize`
    - If `remainingItems` is greater than zero, return the adjusted total as `remainingItems` times (`fullGroups` plus one)
    - If `remainingItems` is zero, return `totalItems` as it is

2. **Main Program Execution:**
    - Read input values for the total number of items for two categories: `firstCategory` and `secondCategory`, as well as the `groupSize`
    - Convert these input values from string format to integer format
    - Calculate the adjusted total for the first category by calling `calculateGroups` with `firstCategory` and `groupSize`
    - Calculate the adjusted total for the second category by calling `calculateGroups` with `secondCategory` and `groupSize`
    - Multiply the two adjusted totals from the first and second categories
    - Output the result of the multiplication

**High-Level Logic Overview:**
- The program reads three integer inputs: the total number of items in two separate categories and the size of a group.
- It determines how many groups can be formed and how many items remain after forming those groups.
- If there are remaining items, it calculates an adjusted count that includes these items in an additional group.
- Finally, it calculates the product of the adjusted counts for both categories and prints the result.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Define a function called `calculateGroups`:
    - Input: `totalItems`, `groupSize`
    - Calculate `fullGroups` = integer division of `totalItems` by `groupSize`
    - Calculate `remainingItems` = remainder of `totalItems` divided by `groupSize`
    - If `remainingItems` > 0:
        - Return `remainingItems` * (`fullGroups` + 1)
    - Else:
        - Return `totalItems`

2. In the main execution:
    - Read a line of input, split it into parts, and convert to integers: `firstCategory`, `secondCategory`, `groupSize`
    - Calculate `adjustedFirstCategory` = `calculateGroups(firstCategory, groupSize)`
    - Calculate `adjustedSecondCategory` = `calculateGroups(secondCategory, groupSize)`
    - Calculate `finalResult` = `adjustedFirstCategory` * `adjustedSecondCategory`
    - Print `finalResult`

By following this structured approach, we can maintain clarity and ensure the logic is easily understandable, aligning with how the original code functions.
