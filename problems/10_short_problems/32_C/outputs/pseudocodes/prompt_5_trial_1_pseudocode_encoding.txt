### Purpose Summary
The goal of this program is to calculate the total number of packages required to distribute two separate quantities of items, ensuring that each package can hold a certain maximum number of items.

### Pseudocode

```
Function CalculatePackages(items, capacity):
    # Determine how many full packages can be created and any remaining items
    fullPackages, remainingItems = Divide items by capacity

    # If there are remaining items, we need one additional package for them
    If remainingItems > 0 Then:
        Return remainingItems multiplied by (fullPackages + 1)
    Else:
        # If there are no remaining items, return the total number of items
        Return items

# Read input values: total items of type A, total items of type B, and the package capacity
Read input values as totalItemsA, totalItemsB, packageCapacity

# Calculate the required packages for type A items and type B items
CalculateTypeAPackages = CalculatePackages(totalItemsA, packageCapacity)
CalculateTypeBPackages = CalculatePackages(totalItemsB, packageCapacity)

# Output the total number of packages needed for both types of items
Print CalculateTypeAPackages multiplied by CalculateTypeBPackages
```

### Annotations
- **CalculatePackages** is the helper function that determines how many packages are needed to hold a given number of items based on their capacity.
- The function uses basic division to find out how many full packages can be filled and checks if there are leftover items that require an additional package.
- The main program part represents reading values for the total items of two types and the package capacity, processing them through the helper function, and finally calculating and outputting the total packages needed.
