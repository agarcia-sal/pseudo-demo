Sure! Here's a structured pseudocode representation of the provided Python code:

```
FUNCTION mc(number, divisor):
    // Divide the number by the divisor and calculate quotient and remainder
    QUOTIENT, REMAINDER = DIVIDE(number, divisor)
    
    // If the remainder is greater than zero, return the product of remainder and incremented quotient
    IF REMAINDER > 0 THEN
        RETURN REMAINDER * (QUOTIENT + 1)
    ELSE
        // If no remainder, return the original number
        RETURN number
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

// Read input values
READ integers n, m, s FROM user input

// Calculate the product of the results of mc function for n and m using s
RESULT = mc(n, s) * mc(m, s)

// Output the final result
PRINT RESULT
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition:** The function `mc` calculates a specific value based on input `number` and `divisor`.
2. **Dividing Logic:** It performs division to obtain the quotient and remainder, using clear conditional checks to determine the return value.
3. **Input Handling:** The input values `n`, `m`, and `s` are read from user input.
4. **Final Calculation:** The results of the function `mc` for inputs `n` and `m` are multiplied together, and the result is printed. 

This pseudocode captures the intent and flow of the original code while maintaining clarity and avoiding technical syntax.
