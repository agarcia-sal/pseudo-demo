Here is the pseudocode for the provided code, following the guided steps outlined:

```
FUNCTION mc(n, s)
    SET q TO n DIVIDED BY s          // Calculate the quotient
    SET r TO n MOD s                  // Calculate the remainder
    IF r GREATER THAN 0 THEN          // Check if there is a remainder
        RETURN r MULTIPLIED BY (q + 1) // Return the adjusted value when there is a remainder
    ELSE
        RETURN n                       // Return n when there is no remainder
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Main program starts here
READ n, m, s FROM input              // Read three integers from input
SET result1 TO mc(n, s)              // Call mc function with n and s
SET result2 TO mc(m, s)              // Call mc function with m and s
PRINT result1 MULTIPLIED BY result2   // Print the product of the two results
```

### Assumptions:
- `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers.
- `s` is not zero, as division by zero would cause an error.
- The input is provided in a format that can be split into three valid integers. 

The pseudocode maintains clarity and reflects the intent of the original code without the intricacies of actual programming syntax. Each operation is outlined step-by-step to ensure readability.
