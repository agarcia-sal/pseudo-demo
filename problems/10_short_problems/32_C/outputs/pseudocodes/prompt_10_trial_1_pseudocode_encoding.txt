**Pseudocode**

**Function mc(n, s):**
1. **Input:** Integer n, Integer s
2. **Calculate** q as the quotient of n divided by s
3. **Calculate** r as the remainder of n divided by s
4. **If** r is greater than 0 **then**
   - Return value as r multiplied by (q + 1)
5. **Else** 
   - Return value as n

**Main Program:**
1. **Input:** Read integers n, m, s from user input
2. **Calculate** result1 as the result of mc(n, s)
3. **Calculate** result2 as the result of mc(m, s)
4. **Calculate** final_result as result1 multiplied by result2
5. **Output:** Print final_result

**Assumptions:**
- The variables n, m, and s are assumed to be positive integers with s being non-zero to avoid division errors.
- The function mc handles the computation of the division and ensures that if there's a remainder, it accounts appropriately for it.

**Note:**
- The function names and variable identifiers reflect their purpose clearly. 
- The structure is straightforward, using conditionals and clear variable assignment to maintain readability.
