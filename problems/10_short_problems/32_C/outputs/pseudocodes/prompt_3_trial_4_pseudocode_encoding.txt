Here's the pseudocode based on the provided code snippet:

```
Function CalculateDivisions(Number totalItems, Number groupSize)
    Calculate quotient and remainder by dividing totalItems by groupSize
    If remainder is greater than 0 then
        Return remainder multiplied by (quotient + 1)
    Else
        Return totalItems
    End If
End Function

Main Program
    Read input values for totalItems1, totalItems2, groupSize
    Calculate firstProduct as CalculateDivisions(totalItems1, groupSize)
    Calculate secondProduct as CalculateDivisions(totalItems2, groupSize)
    Print the result of multiplying firstProduct by secondProduct
End Main Program
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **Function CalculateDivisions**: This function takes two parameters, the total number of items and the size of each group. It calculates how many complete groups can be formed and determines if there are any remaining items. If there are remaining items, it accounts for them by multiplying by one more than the quotient; otherwise, it simply returns the total items.

2. **Main Program**: This section reads input from the user, invokes the `CalculateDivisions` function for both sets of total items, and then prints the product of the results from the two calls.

This structured approach to pseudocode clearly conveys the intent and logic of the original code without getting tangled in specific programming syntax.
