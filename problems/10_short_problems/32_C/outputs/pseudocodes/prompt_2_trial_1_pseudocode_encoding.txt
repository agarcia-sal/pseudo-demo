**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**

2. **Define a function named "calculate_remainder" that takes two inputs:**
   - "total_items" (representing the total number of items)
   - "divisor" (representing the size of each group)
   
   **Inside the function:**
   - Compute the number of complete groups by dividing "total_items" by "divisor", storing this in "complete_groups".
   - Also calculate the remainder of items that do not fit into complete groups, storing this in "remaining_items".
   - If "remaining_items" is greater than zero:
     - Return the total number of orphan items (the remainder) multiplied by one more than the number of complete groups.
   - Otherwise:
     - Return "total_items" directly.

3. **Read a line of input and split it into three integers:**
   - "n" (the total number of items in the first collection),
   - "m" (the total number of items in the second collection),
   - "s" (the size of each group).

4. **Calculate the result using the "calculate_remainder" function:**
   - First, call "calculate_remainder" with "n" and "s", storing the result.
   - Then, call "calculate_remainder" with "m" and "s", storing the result.
   - Multiply the results of both function calls together.

5. **Output the final result.**

6. **End the program.**
