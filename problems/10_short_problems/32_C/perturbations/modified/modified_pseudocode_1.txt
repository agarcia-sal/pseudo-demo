### Purpose Statement
The goal of this code is to calculate a product based on two input values, adjusting each value according to a specified divisor. It first determines how much should be added to each value when they are divided by the divisor, and then it multiplies the adjusted results together.

### Pseudocode

1. **Define Function** `calculate_adjusted_value` 
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `value` (integer): The number to be adjusted.
     - `divisor` (integer): The number by which to divide and adjust the value.
   - **Actions**:
     - Calculate `quotient` and `remainder` by dividing `value` by `divisor`.
     - If `remainder` is greater than 0:
       - Return `remainder` multiplied by `quotient` plus 1.
     - Else: 
       - Return `value` as is.

2. **Read Input Values**
   - Read a line of input and split it into three values: `n`, `m`, and `s`.
   - Convert these input strings into integers.

3. **Calculate Adjusted Values**
   - Call `calculate_adjusted_value` function with `n` and `s`, and store the result in `adjusted_n`.
   - Call `calculate_adjusted_value` function with `m` and `s`, and store the result in `adjusted_m`.

4. **Calculate Product**
   - Multiply `adjusted_n` and `adjusted_m` to get the `result`.

5. **Output Result**
   - Print the `result`.

### Comments for Clarity
- The `calculate_adjusted_value` function adjusts the original number based on how much it is above a multiple of the divisor, adding 1 if there is any leftover from the division.
- The final output is the product of the two adjusted values from the inputs provided.

### Example Structure

- **Function Definition**: Clearly describe the function and its parameters.
- **Input/Output Handling**: Show how to read and process input data.
- **Calculations**: Break down complex calculations into understandable parts.
- **Final Result**: Specify how the final output is displayed.

### Final Review
This pseudocode captures the logic of the original code, ensuring that each step is easy to follow and the intent is clear to readers unfamiliar with the syntax of the original programming language. Adjustments and operations are distinctly highlighted, maintaining logical flow throughout the pseudocode.
