### Purpose Summary
The main goal of the program is to compute a value based on two inputs, `n` and `m`, where each is divided into groups of size `s`. The result then multiplies the adjusted group counts of both inputs.

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION calculateAdjustedGroups(number, groupSize)
    // Divide the number into full groups of the specified size
    fullGroups, remainder = DIVIDE number BY groupSize
    
    // If there is a remainder, meaning there are extra items
    IF remainder IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN
        // Return the total groups including the extra items
        RETURN remainder * (fullGroups + 1)
    ELSE
        // If everything fits perfectly into groups, return the original number
        RETURN number
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Read the inputs from the user (expected to be three integers)
READ inputValues FROM USER
SET n TO inputValues[0]   // First value
SET m TO inputValues[1]   // Second value
SET s TO inputValues[2]   // Group size

// Calculate the adjusted group counts for n and m
SET adjustedGroupsForN TO calculateAdjustedGroups(n, s)
SET adjustedGroupsForM TO calculateAdjustedGroups(m, s)

// Calculate and display the product of the adjusted group counts
PRINT adjustedGroupsForN * adjustedGroupsForM
```

### Explanation of Key Components
1. **Function Definition**: A function named `calculateAdjustedGroups` is created to manage the logic of adjusting the group counts based on input numbers.
  
2. **Division and Remainder**: The function calculates how many full groups can be made (`fullGroups`) and checks if there are any extra items (`remainder`). 

3. **Conditional Logic**: 
   - If there's a remainder (extra items), it adjusts the group count to include those extra items.
   - If there is no remainder, it simply returns the original number.

4. **User Input Handling**: Inputs are read and extracted into individual variables (`n`, `m`, and `s`).

5. **Final Calculation and Output**: The adjusted counts for `n` and `m` are calculated and their product is displayed as the final output.

### Notes
- The pseudocode uses plain language and simple operations to ensure it is understandable.
- Each function and variable is named to indicate its purpose clearly, supporting easy interpretation of the functionality.
- Considerations for clarity include comments that explain each section and step, enhancing the understanding of the flow and logic of the code.
