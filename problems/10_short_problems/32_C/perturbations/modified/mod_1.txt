Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided Python code that captures its logic and operations:

```
FUNCTION calculate_remainder(n, s)
    // Divide n by s and get the quotient (q) and remainder (r)
    SET quotient, remainder TO the result of dividing n by s
    // If remainder is greater than 0, return (remainder * (quotient + 1))
    // Otherwise, return n
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION main()
    // Read a line of input and convert it into three integers n, m, and s
    SET n, m, s TO the list of integers from input
    // Calculate the product of calculate_remainder(n, s) and calculate_remainder(m, s)
    SET result TO (calculate_remainder(n, s) * calculate_remainder(m, s))
    // Output the result
    PRINT result
END FUNCTION

// Call the main function to execute the program
CALL main()
```
This pseudocode is designed to give a clear and structured understanding of the program's logic while ensuring that it remains accessible to readers of varying expertise in programming.
