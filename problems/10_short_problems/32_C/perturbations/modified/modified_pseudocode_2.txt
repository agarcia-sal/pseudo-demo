**Objective:** The goal of this code is to compute a specific product based on two integer inputs, using a function that manipulates these inputs based on division and remainder operations.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Define a Function to Calculate Modified Count**
   - **Function Name**: CalculateModifiedCount
   - **Input**: 
     - TotalItems (integer): The total number of items
     - GroupSize (integer): The size of each group
   - **Process**:
     - Divide TotalItems by GroupSize to get the quotient and the remainder.
     - If the remainder is greater than zero:
       - Return the product of the remainder and one more than the quotient (this adjusts for partial groups).
     - Otherwise:
       - Return the total number of items (indicating that they fit completely into groups).
   - **Output**: A modified count based on the grouping.

2. **Get Input Values from User**
   - Read a single line of input that contains three integers: TotalItemsN, TotalItemsM, GroupSizeS.
   - Convert these values into integers.

3. **Calculate Modified Counts**
   - Call CalculateModifiedCount with TotalItemsN and GroupSizeS, and store the result.
   - Call CalculateModifiedCount with TotalItemsM and GroupSizeS, and store the result.

4. **Compute Final Product**
   - Multiply the two modified counts obtained from the previous step.

5. **Display the Result**
   - Print the final product.

**Detailed Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateModifiedCount(TotalItems, GroupSize):
    // Divide TotalItems by GroupSize
    Quotient, Remainder = TotalItems DIVIDED BY GroupSize 

    // Check if there is a remainder
    IF Remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN Remainder * (Quotient + 1) // Include partial group adjustments
    ELSE
        RETURN TotalItems // No partial groups

// Get user input
InputLine = READ a line of input
TotalItemsN, TotalItemsM, GroupSizeS = CONVERT InputLine to integers

// Calculate modified counts for both total items
ModifiedCountN = CALL CalculateModifiedCount(TotalItemsN, GroupSizeS)
ModifiedCountM = CALL CalculateModifiedCount(TotalItemsM, GroupSizeS)

// Calculate the final product
FinalProduct = ModifiedCountN * ModifiedCountM

// Print the result
PRINT FinalProduct
```

**Notes:**
- Each step in this pseudocode describes the function, its inputs, and expected outputs in an approachable manner.
- Control structures such as conditionals are represented in plain language, making it easier to understand the logic.
- This approach ensures that even those unfamiliar with programming can grasp the core functionality of the code.
