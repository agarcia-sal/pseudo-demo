Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided Python code that captures its logic and operations:

```
FUNCTION calculate_remainder(n, s)
    SET quotient, remainder TO the result of dividing n by s
    IF remainder > 0 THEN
        RETURN remainder * (quotient + 1)
    ELSE
        RETURN n
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION main()
    SET n, m, s TO the list of integers from input
    SET result TO (calculate_remainder(n, s) * calculate_remainder(m, s))
    PRINT result
END FUNCTION

CALL main()
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Function: `calculate_remainder`** - This function takes two parameters `n` (an integer) and `s` (another integer) and calculates the result based on the division of `n` by `s`.
   - It calculates the quotient and remainder from the division using a high-level abstraction.
   - Depending on the value of the remainder, it returns different calculations as specified in the original code.

2. **Function: `main`** - This function serves as the entry point for the program.
   - It reads from standard input and parses three integers: `n`, `m`, and `s`.
   - The main computation involves calling `calculate_remainder` for both `n` and `m`, multiplying the results, and printing the final output.

3. **Control Structures** - The pseudocode uses clear conditional statements to represent the logical checks and loops if necessary.

This pseudocode is designed to give a clear and structured understanding of the program's logic while ensuring that it remains accessible to readers of varying expertise in programming.
