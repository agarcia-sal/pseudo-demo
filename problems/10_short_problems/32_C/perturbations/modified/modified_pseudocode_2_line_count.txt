**Purpose:** The code is designed to calculate a specific product based on two input numbers, using a modular operation to determine how many full groups can be formed and any leftover items.

---

**Pseudocode:**

```
Function CalculateMaxItems(num1, num2, size):
    Divide num1 by size, store the quotient in fullGroups1 and the remainder in leftovers1
    If leftovers1 is greater than 0:
        Return leftovers1 times (fullGroups1 + 1)  // Calculate new maximum items including leftover
    Else:
        Return num1  // If no leftover, return the original number

// Main Program:
Read three integers: totalItems1, totalItems2, groupSize from input
// totalItems1 represents total items from the first set
// totalItems2 represents total items from the second set
// groupSize represents the maximum size for each group

result1 = CalculateMaxItems(totalItems1, groupSize) // Calculate for the first set 
result2 = CalculateMaxItems(totalItems2, groupSize) // Calculate for the second set

Print the product of result1 and result2  // Output the final result
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The function `CalculateMaxItems` computes how many groups can be formed from a given number of items, factoring in any leftovers.
- The `num1` and `num2` are the total numbers of items for the first and second input values, respectively.
- The `size` variable determines the maximum number of items that can fit in each group, guiding how the total items are divided.
- The program ultimately outputs the product of the modified item counts from both input numbers based on the grouping logic.
