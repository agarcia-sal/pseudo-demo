**Pseudocode Translation:**

```
FUNCTION findLongestRepeatedSubstring(inputString)
    INITIALIZE lengthOfInput AS the length of inputString
    INITIALIZE longestRepeatedLength AS 0

    FOR substringLength FROM 0 TO lengthOfInput - 1 DO
        FOR index FROM 0 TO lengthOfInput - 1 DO
            EXTRACT substring FROM inputString starting at index with length substringLength
            
            IF substring is found in inputString starting from index + 1 THEN
                SET longestRepeatedLength TO substringLength
                BREAK OUT OF inner loop
            END IF
        END FOR
    END FOR

    RETURN longestRepeatedLength
END FUNCTION

// Main execution starts here
READ inputLine FROM standard input
CALL findLongestRepeatedSubstring(inputLine)
PRINT the result
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Purpose Clarification:** The goal of the original code is to find the length of the longest repeated substring within a given input string.

2. **Meaningful Names:** Variable names like `inputString`, `lengthOfInput`, and `longestRepeatedLength` clearly represent their purpose in the context of the algorithm.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** The pseudocode describes actions at a higher level without detailing the specific syntax of the original programming language. 

4. **Control Structures Representation:** The nested loops and conditional checks are clearly delineated to demonstrate the flow of the algorithm.

5. **Input and Output:** The pseudocode specifies that it reads an input string, calculates the longest repeated substring length, and prints that result.

6. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode follows a clear structure and provides consistent formatting.

7. **Natural Language:** The pseudocode uses straightforward language to articulate the operations being performed.

8. **Clarity Review:** The pseudocode has been assessed to maintain clarity and coherence, accurately reflecting the logic of the original code.

9. **Complexity Context:** The nested loops for substring checking and the condition to identify repetitions are crucial and clearly outlined to enhance understanding.

10. **Final Output Expectations:** The final pseudocode succinctly describes the original codeâ€™s logic, making the operations comprehensible for readers with varying programming levels.
