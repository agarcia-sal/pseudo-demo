To accurately translate the provided code into high-level pseudocode, we will follow the outlined steps to clarify the code's logic, operations, and intent. Hereâ€™s the pseudocode:

```plaintext
FUNCTION findLongestRepeatedSubstring(inputString)
    SET stringLength TO LENGTH of inputString
    INITIALIZE longestRepeatedLength TO 0

    FOR length FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO
        FOR index FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO
            SET substring TO substring of inputString from index to index + length
            IF substring occurs again after the current index THEN
                SET longestRepeatedLength TO length
                BREAK the inner loop
            END IF
        END FOR
    END FOR

    RETURN longestRepeatedLength
END FUNCTION

// INPUT: Read a line of input from the user
SET userInput TO READ input from standard input
// OUTPUT: Call the function with user input and print the result
PRINT findLongestRepeatedSubstring(userInput)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Purpose:** The code aims to find the length of the longest repeated substring in a given input string.

2. **Meaningful Names:** The function and variable names clarify their purpose:
   - `findLongestRepeatedSubstring` indicates the function's role.
   - `inputString`, `stringLength`, `longestRepeatedLength`, `length`, `index`, and `substring` clearly describe what they represent.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** The pseudocode abstracts away specific implementations, using descriptive operations that encompass the logic without requiring specific programming language syntax.

4. **Control Structures:** The nested loops are clearly expressed with "FOR" loops, and conditions are expressed in straightforward language.

5. **Input and Output:** It specifies that input is read from standard input and describes the expected output.

6. **Structured Format:** The pseudocode follows a consistent format, making it easy to follow.

7. **Natural Language:** The actions are presented in simple language, ensuring accessibility for readers regardless of their programming expertise.

8. **Clarity Review:** The pseudocode accurately represents the logic of the original code.

9. **Complexity Context:** The code includes a check to see if a substring appears again after its starting index, which is an essential and somewhat complex part of the algorithm.

10. **Final Expectations:** The pseudocode captures the essence of the code's logic and flow, making it understandable for various readers.
