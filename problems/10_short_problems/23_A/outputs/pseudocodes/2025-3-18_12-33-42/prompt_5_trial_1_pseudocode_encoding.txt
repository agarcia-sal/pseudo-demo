**Purpose:** The code is designed to find the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears more than once.

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
BEGIN
    // Read input string from the standard input
    INPUT string

    // Determine the length of the input string
    SET lengthOfString TO LENGTH of string

    // Initialize a variable to hold the length of the longest repeated substring
    SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO 0

    // Loop through potential substring lengths from 0 to the full length of the string
    FOR substringLength FROM 0 TO lengthOfString-1 DO
        // Initialize an index for checking starting positions of substrings
        SET index TO 0

        // Check all starting positions for possible repeated substrings
        FUNCTION findLongestSubstring(substringLength, index):
            // Loop through the string for potential starting points
            WHILE index < lengthOfString DO
                // Extract a substring of the current length
                DEFINE currentSubstring AS substring from index to index + substringLength

                // Check if the substring appears again in the string after the current index
                IF currentSubstring exists in string starting from position (index + 1) THEN
                    // If found, it is a repeated substring
                    SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO substringLength
                    RETURN true

                // Move to the next starting position
                INCREMENT index

            RETURN false

        // Call the function to check for substrings of current length
        CALL findLongestSubstring(substringLength, index)

        // If any repeated substring was found for this length, move to the next longer length
        IF longestRepeatedSubstringLength IS NOT EQUAL TO 0 THEN
            BREAK

    // Output the length of the longest repeated substring
    PRINT longestRepeatedSubstringLength

END
```

### Breakdown of Key Steps:
1. **Input Handling:** The program starts by accepting a string input from the user.
2. **Length Calculation:** It calculates the length of the string to determine the range of substring lengths to inspect.
3. **Nested Looping:** It iterates through possible substring lengths and corresponding starting indexes to find repeated substrings.
4. **Substring Extraction:** For each position, it extracts substrings and checks for their repetition in the remaining part of the string.
5. **Finding Repetitions:** If a repeated substring is found, it updates the record of the longest substring length.
6. **Termination and Output:** The process continues until all lengths are checked, or a repetition is found, followed by outputting the result.

### Comments:
- Each operation is clearly defined with meaningful names to help users understand the purpose of each step.
- Complex logic is simplified by breaking it down into digestible functions, enhancing the overall readability and comprehension of the pseudocode.
