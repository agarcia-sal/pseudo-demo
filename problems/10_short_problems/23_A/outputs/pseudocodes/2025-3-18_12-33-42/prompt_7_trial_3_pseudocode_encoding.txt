Here's a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided code, encapsulating its logic and operations:

```
FUNCTION findLongestRepeatedSubstring(inputString)
    INITIALIZE substringLength to 0
    SET stringLength to the length of inputString

    FOR length from 0 to stringLength - 1 DO
        FOR index from 0 to stringLength - 1 DO
            SET currentSubstring to the substring of inputString from index of length length
            IF currentSubstring is found in inputString starting from index + 1 THEN
                SET substringLength to length
                BREAK the inner loop
            END IF
        END FOR
    END FOR

    RETURN substringLength
END FUNCTION

// Read input string from standard input
INPUT userInputString
CALL findLongestRepeatedSubstring(userInputString)
PRINT result
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `findLongestRepeatedSubstring` takes an input string as its parameter.
2. **Variable Initialization**: We use `substringLength` to keep track of the length of the longest found repeated substring, and `stringLength` to store the length of the input string.
3. **Nested Loops**:
    - The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths from `0` to `stringLength - 1`. 
    - The inner loop checks each starting position of the input string.
4. **Substring Check**: A substring is generated based on the current index and length. The code checks if this substring appears later in the input string (starting from the index + 1).
5. **Updating Result**: If a match is found, the length of the substring is stored in `substringLength`, and the inner loop is exited prematurely.
6. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns the length of the longest repeated substring found.
7. **Input/Output**: The code assumes an input string is read from standard input, and the result is printed.

This pseudocode effectively captures the original code's intent while abstracting away the intricate implementation details, making it accessible to various audiences.
