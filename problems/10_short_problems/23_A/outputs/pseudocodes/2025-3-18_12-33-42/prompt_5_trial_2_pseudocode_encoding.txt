**Purpose:**  
The purpose of the code is to find the length of the longest substring that appears more than once in a given input string.

**Pseudocode:**

```
START

// Read a line of input and remove the trailing newline character
SET inputLine TO readInputLine() // This function simulates input from stdin
STORE the length of inputLine in variable stringLength

// Initialize the variable to hold the result
SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO 0

// Loop through each possible substring length from 0 to stringLength - 1
FOR substringLength FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO

    // For each position in the string
    FOR position IN range from 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO

        // Extract the substring of the current length starting from the current position
        SET currentSubstring TO extractSubstring(inputLine, position, substringLength)

        // Check if the current substring appears again in the input line after the current position
        IF findSubstringInLine(inputLine, currentSubstring, position + 1) THEN
            // If it does, update the longest repeated substring length
            SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO substringLength
            BREAK out of the inner loop // No need to check further positions for this length
        END IF
        
    END FOR
    
END FOR

// Output the length of the longest repeated substring
PRINT longestRepeatedSubstringLength

END
```

**Definitions of Helper Functions:**

1. **readInputLine()**: Simulates reading a single line of input.
2. **extractSubstring(line, startIndex, length)**: Returns a substring from `line` starting at `startIndex` with the specified `length`.
3. **findSubstringInLine(line, substring, startAfterIndex)**: Checks if `substring` is found in `line` starting from `startAfterIndex`.

**Comments:**  
- The outer loop iterates over potential substring lengths.
- The inner loop checks each starting position for substrings of the current length.
- The check for repeated substrings takes place using the helper function, ensuring clarity in intention and operation.
