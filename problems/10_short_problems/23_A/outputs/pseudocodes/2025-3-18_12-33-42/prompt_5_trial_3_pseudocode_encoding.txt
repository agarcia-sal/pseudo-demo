### Purpose Summary:
The goal of this code is to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears more than once.

### Pseudocode:

```plaintext
START PROGRAM

// Read a single line of input, which is a string
INPUT stringLine

// Get the length of the input string
SET stringLength = LENGTH(stringLine)

// Initialize a variable to store the length of the longest repeating substring
SET longestRepeatLength = 0

// Loop over possible substring lengths from 0 to the length of the string
FOR currentLength FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO

    // Loop over each starting position of the substring up to the maximum length
    FOR startPosition FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO
        
        // Define the current substring from startPosition with currentLength
        SET currentSubstring = SUBSTRING(stringLine, startPosition, currentLength)
        
        // Check if this substring exists elsewhere in the string
        IF currentSubstring EXISTS in stringLine starting after startPosition THEN
            // If a repeat is found, update longestRepeatLength and exit the inner loop
            SET longestRepeatLength = currentLength
            BREAK OUT OF inner loop
        
        ENDIF
    END FOR
    
END FOR

// Output the length of the longest repeating substring
OUTPUT longestRepeatLength

END PROGRAM
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input**: The program reads a string input, which represents a series of characters.
2. **Length Calculation**: It calculates the length of that string to determine how long it can check for substrings.
3. **Nested Loops**: 
   - The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths, starting from 0 up to the length of the string minus one.
   - The inner loop checks every possible starting position for creating substrings of that specific length.
4. **Substring Extraction**: The program forms a substring based on the current length and starting position.
5. **Repeat Check**: It checks if that substring appears again later in the string. 
6. **Updating Result**: When a repeating substring is found, it updates the `longestRepeatLength` variable to reflect the length of the substring.
7. **Final Output**: Finally, it prints the result of the length of the longest repeating substring found. 

This structured approach in pseudocode helps clarify the operations within the original code and makes it easier for readers to understand the logic without programming syntax.
