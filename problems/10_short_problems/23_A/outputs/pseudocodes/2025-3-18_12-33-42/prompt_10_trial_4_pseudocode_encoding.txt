Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that translates the given Python code into a clear and concise structured format:

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input Line:**
   - Read a line of input from the standard input.
   - Remove the last character from the line (assumed to be a newline).

2. **Determine Length of Input:**
   - Set variable `n` to the length of the input line.
   - Initialize variable `rv` to 0.

3. **Outer Loop - Iterate Length:**
   - For each integer `l` from 0 to `n` (exclusive):
     - **Inner Loop - Iterate Over Characters:**
       - For each integer `i` from 0 to `n` (exclusive):
         - **Check Substring Existence:**
           - Extract substring `sub` from `line` starting at index `i` of length `l`.
           - If `sub` is found in `line` starting from index `i + 1`:
             - Set `rv` to `l`.
             - Break the inner loop.

4. **Output Result:**
   - Print the value of `rv`.

**Assumptions:**
- The input is a non-empty string (as there is no check for an empty line).
- The string may contain duplicate characters.
- The indexing used is based on zero-based indexing, which is common in programming.

**Notes:**
- The variable names (`line`, `n`, `rv`, `l`, `i`, `sub`) are chosen to be descriptive enough for the context of the operations they represent.
- The control flow emphasizes clarity with explicit loop structures and conditional checks.
