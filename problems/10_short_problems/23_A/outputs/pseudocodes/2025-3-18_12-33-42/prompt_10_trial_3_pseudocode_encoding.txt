Hereâ€™s the pseudocode based on the provided code, structured clearly and concisely:

```plaintext
BEGIN Main

  // Read input
  SET line TO read input line from standard input
  REMOVE last character from line (assume it is a newline character)
  SET n TO length of line
  SET rv TO 0  // Initialize return value
  
  // Outer loop for substring lengths
  FOR l FROM 0 TO n-1 DO

    // Inner loop for checking substrings
    FOR i FROM 0 TO n-1 DO
      
      // Check if the substring exists in the remainder of the string
      SET substring TO line[i:i+l]
      IF line contains substring starting from index (i + 1) THEN
        SET rv TO l  // Update rv with current length
        BREAK  // Exit inner loop
      
      END IF
    
    END FOR

  END FOR
  
  // Output the result
  PRINT rv

END Main
```

### Explanation of Key Components:
1. **Input Reading:** The line of input is read and the newline character is removed.
2. **Loop Structures:** Two nested loops are utilized, where the outer loop iterates through possible substring lengths and the inner loop checks for the existence of substrings.
3. **Substring Checking:** A substring is formed from the original line, and its presence is checked in the remaining string.
4. **Return Value Update:** The return value (`rv`) is updated whenever a substring match is found.

### Assumptions Made:
- `line` can contain any characters, and its length can vary.
- The handling of indexes assumes that all operations are valid within the length of the string.
- The input is processed as a single line with a newline character that needs removal.
