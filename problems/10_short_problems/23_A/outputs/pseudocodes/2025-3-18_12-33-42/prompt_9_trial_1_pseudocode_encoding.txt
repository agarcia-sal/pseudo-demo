**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to determine the length of the longest substring in a given string that occurs more than once.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

  // Read input string from the user
  INPUT userInputString
  
  // Calculate the length of the input string
  SET stringLength TO LENGTH OF userInputString
  
  // Initialize a variable to store the maximum length of duplicating substring
  SET longestDuplicateLength TO 0
  
  // Loop through possible lengths of substrings
  FOR substringLength FROM 0 TO stringLength-1 DO
    
    // Loop through each starting index for the substring
    FOR startingIndex FROM 0 TO stringLength-1 DO
      
      // Extract the current substring
      SET currentSubstring TO userInputString FROM startingIndex TO startingIndex + substringLength
      
      // Check if the current substring occurs later in the string
      IF currentSubstring occurs in userInputString starting from index (startingIndex + 1) THEN
        
        // Update the longest duplicate length if a longer duplicate is found
        SET longestDuplicateLength TO substringLength
        
        // Exit the inner loop as we found a valid duplicate
        BREAK
        
      ENDIF

    ENDFOR

  ENDFOR

  // Output the length of the longest duplicate substring found
  OUTPUT longestDuplicateLength
  
END
```

**Explanation of Pseudocode Components:**

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by indicating that a string is read from the user.
2. **Length Calculation:** It calculates the length of the input string for use in loops.
3. **Primary Logic:** The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths. The inner loop considers starting positions of substrings of that length.
4. **Substring Evaluation:** For each substring, it checks if that substring appears again in the string starting after its initial occurrence.
5. **Output:** Finally, the algorithm prints the length of the longest substring found that occurs multiple times. 

This format maintains the original logic while simplifying and clarifying the process for easier understanding.
