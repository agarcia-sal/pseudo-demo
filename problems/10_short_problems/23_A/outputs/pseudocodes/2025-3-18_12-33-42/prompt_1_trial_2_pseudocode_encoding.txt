**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

  // Read a line of input from the user and remove the newline character
  INPUT line
  SET length_of_line TO length of line
  SET result_variable TO 0

  // Iterate over possible substring lengths from 0 to the length of the line
  FOR each substring_length FROM 0 TO length_of_line - 1 DO
    
    // Iterate through each character in the line
    FOR each index FROM 0 TO length_of_line - 1 DO
      
      // Extract the substring starting at the current index with the current length
      SET current_substring TO the substring from index to index + substring_length
      
      // Check if the current substring appears again in the line after the current index
      IF current_substring found in line starting from index + 1 THEN
        
        // Update the result variable with the current length
        SET result_variable TO substring_length
        
        // Exit the inner loop since we found a repeating substring
        BREAK

    // Check if a repeating substring was found and break the outer loop if so
    IF result_variable is not 0 THEN
      BREAK

  // Output the length of the longest repeating substring found
  OUTPUT result_variable

END
```

**Explanation:**
- The pseudocode starts by reading a line of input and stripping away the newline character.
- It initializes a variable to keep track of the longest length of the repeating substring found.
- It has two nested loops: the outer loop goes through each possible length of substrings, and the inner loop checks each position in the string for substrings of that length.
- For each substring being checked, it looks for occurrences of that substring later in the string. If it finds a match, it updates the result variable and stops checking further for that length.
- Finally, it prints the length of the longest repeating substring found, which could be zero if no repetitions are found.
