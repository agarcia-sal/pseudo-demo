**Purpose:**  
The goal of this code is to find the length of the longest substring in a given line of text that appears more than once.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a line of text and remove the trailing newline character.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set the total length of the line into a variable called `lineLength`.
   - Create a variable `longestRepeatedLength`, initialized to 0. This will store the length of the longest repeated substring.

3. **Outer Loop:**
   - For each possible substring length `substringLength` from 0 to `lineLength - 1`:
     - (Note: Adjust the loop condition to ensure substrings of at least 1 character are evaluated)
     
4. **Inner Loop:**
   - For each starting position `startIndex` in the line from 0 to `lineLength - substringLength`:
     - Extract the substring using the current `startIndex` and `substringLength`.

5. **Check for Repetition:**
   - Search for this substring in the line starting from the next position (`startIndex + 1`):
     - If this substring appears again, update `longestRepeatedLength` to the value of `substringLength`.
     - Exit the inner loop if a match is found to avoid unnecessary checks.

6. **Output Result:**
   - Print the value of `longestRepeatedLength`, which indicates the length of the longest repeated substring found in the input line.

**Pseudocode Representation:**

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Receive Input
    INPUT line
    
    // Step 2: Initialize Variables
    SET lineLength = LENGTH of line
    SET longestRepeatedLength = 0
    
    // Step 3: Outer Loop for substring lengths
    FOR each substringLength FROM 1 to lineLength - 1 DO
        
        // Step 4: Inner Loop for starting positions
        FOR each startIndex FROM 0 to lineLength - substringLength DO
            
            // Extract current substring
            SET currentSubstring = SUBSTRING of line from startIndex with length substringLength
            
            // Step 5: Check for Repetition
            IF currentSubstring appears in line starting from startIndex + 1 THEN
                SET longestRepeatedLength = substringLength
                BREAK OUT OF inner loop // Exit once a repetition is found
            
        END FOR // End of Inner Loop
        
    END FOR // End of Outer Loop
    
    // Step 6: Output Result
    PRINT longestRepeatedLength
END
``` 

This pseudocode accurately represents the logic and structure of the original program while making it understandable for readers not familiar with specific programming languages. Each step is outlined clearly, ensuring flow and purpose are maintained.
