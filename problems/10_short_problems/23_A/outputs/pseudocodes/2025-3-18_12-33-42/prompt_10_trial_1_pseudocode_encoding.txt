Here's a structured pseudocode representation of the provided Python code, following the guided steps:

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read input line
    READ line from standard input
    REMOVE the last character from line (this is usually a newline character)

    // Step 2: Initialize variables
    SET n to the length of line
    SET rv to 0

    // Step 3: Loop through possible substring lengths (from 0 to n-1)
    FOR l FROM 0 TO n-1 DO
        // Step 4: Nested loop to check all starting positions for substrings
        FOR i FROM 0 TO n-1 DO
            // Step 5: Check if there is a repeated substring
            IF FIND substring line[i:i+l] in line starting from index i+1 THEN
                SET rv to l  // Update the value of rv to the current length l
                BREAK // Exit the inner loop since we found a repeat
            END IF
        END FOR
    END FOR

    // Step 6: Output the result
    PRINT rv

END
```

### Assumptions:
1. The input is read from standard input and processed to remove the trailing newline character.
2. The variable `line` is assumed to be a string containing characters.
3. The variable `n` is assumed to represent the length of the string.
4. The operation FIND is assumed to return the index of the substring within `line` or -1 if not found.
5. The substring defined as `line[i:i+l]` extracts a segment of `line` starting at index `i` and of length `l`. 

### Notes:
- The pseudocode uses clear and meaningful identifiers (like `READ`, `PRINT`, `FIND`, etc.) to maintain readability.
- Each step logically follows the original code structure while being free of coding-specific syntax and jargon.
