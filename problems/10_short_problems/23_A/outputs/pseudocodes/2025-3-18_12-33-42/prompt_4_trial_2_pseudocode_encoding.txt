``` 

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode represents the core logic of the provided code while using clear naming conventions and comments to illustrate its functionality.
- The function `find_longest_repeated_substring` captures the process of finding the length of the longest repeated substring.
- Control structures like loops and conditions are clearly articulated to enhance understanding.
- The final output processes the input and calls the function to print the result.
