**Purpose:**  
The code is designed to find the length of the longest prefix of a given string that repeats elsewhere in the string.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN
  // Read a line of input and remove the trailing newline character
  INPUT stringLine 
  stringLength = LENGTH of stringLine
  longestRepeatingPrefixLength = 0

  // Iterate over possible prefix lengths
  FOR prefixLength FROM 1 TO stringLength - 1 DO
    // Check if there exists a repeated substring of the current prefix length
    FOR startIndex FROM 0 TO stringLength - prefixLength DO
      // Extract the substring from startIndex with the current prefix length
      prefixSubstring = stringLine[startIndex : startIndex + prefixLength]
      
      // Search for the prefixSubstring in the remainder of the string
      IF prefixSubstring IS FOUND in stringLine FROM startIndex + prefixLength TO END THEN
        longestRepeatingPrefixLength = prefixLength
        BREAK OUT OF INNER LOOP
      END IF
    END FOR
  END FOR

  // Output the length of the longest repeating prefix found
  OUTPUT longestRepeatingPrefixLength
END
```

**Clarification of Key Operations:**
- **INPUT:** Accepts a string line from standard input.
- **LENGTH:** Computes the number of characters in the string.
- **LOOPS:** Iterates through different possible lengths for prefixes starting from 1 to just below the total length of the string.
- **SUBSTRING:** Extracts parts of the string for comparison.
- **SEARCH:** Checks if a specified substring occurs later in the string.
- **OUTPUT:** Displays the length of the longest repeating prefix detected.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The outer loop iterates through possible prefix lengths.
- The inner loop checks each possible starting point for that prefix length, ensuring no overlap with previously matched occurrences.
- The process continues until finding the longest repeating prefix or exhausting all options. 

This pseudocode effectively communicates the logic of the original code in an accessible manner, making it easier to understand the operations being performed.
