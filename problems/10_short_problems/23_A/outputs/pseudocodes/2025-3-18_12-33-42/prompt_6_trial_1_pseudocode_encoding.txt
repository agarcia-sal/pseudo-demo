Here is the pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```
BEGIN

  // Read input from the user and remove the trailing newline character
  SET inputLine TO readInputLine()
  SET lengthOfLine TO the length of inputLine
  SET resultValue TO 0

  // Iterate over possible substring lengths starting from 0 up to the length of the input line
  FOR each length l FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO

    // Iterate through each starting index in the input line
    FOR each index i FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO
      
      // Check if the substring from index i of length l occurs again after index i
      IF inputLine contains the substring inputLine[i:i+l] starting from index i + 1 THEN
        // If it exists, update the resultValue to the current length l
        SET resultValue TO l
        BREAK the inner loop

    END FOR

  END FOR

  // Output the result value
  PRINT resultValue

END
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode starts by reading input from the user and initializes required variables.
- It contains nested loops to explore all possible substrings of various lengths within the input string.
- For each substring, it checks if that substring appears again later in the string.
- If a repeating substring is found, it updates the result and breaks out of the inner loop, preventing further checks for that particular length.
- Finally, it prints the length of the longest found substring that repeats.
