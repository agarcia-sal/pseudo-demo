**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Read a line of input and remove the last character
    INPUT line FROM standard input
    REMOVE last character FROM line
    SET length_of_line TO length of line
    INITIALIZE return_value TO 0

    // Iterate over all possible lengths of substrings
    FOR length FROM 0 TO length_of_line EXCLUSIVE DO
        // Check each starting position in the line
        FOR starting_position FROM 0 TO length_of_line EXCLUSIVE DO
            // Extract the current substring
            SET current_substring TO substring of line FROM starting_position TO starting_position + length
            
            // Check if the substring appears again in the line after the starting position
            IF current_substring appears in line starting from position (starting_position + 1) THEN
                // Update the return value with the current length
                SET return_value TO length
                BREAK OUT OF inner loop

        END FOR
        
    END FOR

    // Output the longest length of found repeating substring
    PRINT return_value

END
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode begins by reading an input line and removing the last character.
- It computes the length of the input line and initializes a variable to store the longest length of a repeating substring found (`return_value`).
- It then uses two nested loops: the outer loop iterates through possible lengths of substrings, and the inner loop checks all possible starting positions for those substrings.
- For each substring, it checks if that substring can be found again later in the line.
- If a repeating substring is found, it updates the `return_value` and breaks out of the inner loop to continue searching for longer substrings.
- Finally, it prints the length of the longest repeating substring found.
