**Pseudocode:**

1. Read a line of input and remove any trailing newline character.
2. Determine the length of the input line and store it in a variable called `lengthOfInput`.
3. Initialize a variable `longestRepeatedSubstringLength` to 0.

4. For each possible length `currentLength` from 0 to `lengthOfInput - 1`:
   a. For each position `startIndex` from 0 to `lengthOfInput - 1`:
      i. Extract a substring `currentSubstring` from the input line starting at `startIndex` with the length `currentLength`.
      ii. Check if this `currentSubstring` appears again in the input line after the position `startIndex`.
      iii. If `currentSubstring` is found at some position greater than `startIndex`:
          - Update `longestRepeatedSubstringLength` to `currentLength`.
          - Exit the inner loop to check the next `currentLength`.

5. Print the value of `longestRepeatedSubstringLength` which represents the length of the longest repeated substring found in the input line.
