**Purpose:** The code is designed to find the length of the longest substring within a given input string that appears more than once.

**Pseudocode:**

```
START

// Read the input line from the user and remove the last character (usually a newline).
READ inputLine
REMOVE lastCharacter from inputLine

// Calculate the length of the input line.
SET lengthOfInput to length of inputLine

// Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length of substrings found.
SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength to 0

// Loop through all possible lengths of substrings, starting from 0 to the length of the input line.
FOR substringLength FROM 0 TO lengthOfInput - 1 DO

    // Loop through each starting position in the string for a substring of the current length.
    FOR startIndex FROM 0 TO lengthOfInput - substringLength DO
      
        // Extract the substring from the input string starting at startIndex with the current length.
        SET currentSubstring to inputLine[startIndex TO startIndex + substringLength]

        // Check if this substring appears again in the input string, starting from the position after startIndex.
        IF findPositionOf(currentSubstring in inputLine starting from startIndex + 1) is NOT -1 THEN
            // If found, update the longest substring length variable.
            SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength to substringLength
            // Break out of the loop as we only need the longest length for this size.
            BREAK
        END IF

    END FOR

END FOR

// Output the maximum length of the repeated substring found.
PRINT longestRepeatedSubstringLength

END
```

**Explanation:**

- The pseudocode starts by reading the input line and removing any trailing newline.
- It calculates the length of the input and initializes a variable to track the longest repeated substring's length.
- Two nested loops are employed: the outer loop iterates over possible lengths of substrings, while the inner loop checks each substring of that length.
- The code checks if the current substring appears again in the string after its first occurrence.
- If a repeated substring is found, it updates the longest length, then breaks out of the inner loop to avoid further checks for that size.
- Finally, it prints the length of the longest repeated substring found. 

This pseudocode is structured clearly and can be easily understood by readers with basic programming knowledge.
