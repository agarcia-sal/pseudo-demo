**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Read a line of input from the standard input
    INPUT line
    // Step 2: Remove the last character from the input line (typically a newline)
    line = TRIM_LAST_CHARACTER(line)

    // Step 3: Determine the length of the line
    n = LENGTH(line)

    // Step 4: Initialize a variable to store the result
    rv = 0

    // Step 5: Iterate through possible substring lengths from 0 to n-1
    FOR l FROM 0 TO n - 1 DO
        // Step 6: Iterate through each character in the line
        FOR i FROM 0 TO n - 1 DO
            // Step 7: Check if a substring of length l starting at index i
            //         can be found elsewhere in the line after index i
            IF FIND_SUBSTRING(line, SUBSTRING(line, i, l), i + 1) IS NOT -1 THEN
                // Step 8: Update rv to the current length l
                rv = l
                // Step 9: Exit the inner loop since a match is found
                BREAK
            ENDIF
        ENDFOR
    ENDFOR

    // Step 10: Output the result
    PRINT(rv)
END
```

### Assumptions:
1. **Input Handling**: It is assumed that the input is read as a line of text from standard input. 
2. **String Operations**: Functions like `TRIM_LAST_CHARACTER`, `LENGTH`, `FIND_SUBSTRING`, and `SUBSTRING` are defined and behave as expected. 
3. **Data Types**: It is assumed that `line` is treated as a string, and `rv` is an integer. 

### Clarifications on Readability:
- Each action is written clearly to describe the intended logic of the original code without the use of specific programming language syntax.
- Control structures (like loops and conditionals) are articulated plainly with clearly defined actions.
