**Purpose Summary**: The code is designed to find and return the length of the longest substring of a given input that appears more than once within that input.

**Pseudocode**:

```
START

// Read a line of input and remove the trailing newline character
input_line = READ_INPUT()
length_of_input = GET_LENGTH(input_line)
longest_repeated_length = 0

// Loop through all possible substring lengths from 0 to (length of input - 1)
FOR substring_length FROM 0 TO (length_of_input - 1) DO
    // Loop through all starting positions of the substring in the input
    FOR start_index FROM 0 TO (length_of_input - 1) DO
        // Extract the current substring based on the start_index and substring_length
        current_substring = EXTRACT_SUBSTRING(input_line, start_index, substring_length)
        
        // Check if the current substring appears again in the input beyond its starting position
        IF EXISTS(current_substring IN input_line STARTING AFTER start_index) THEN
            // If it does, update the length of the longest repeated substring found
            longest_repeated_length = substring_length
            BREAK OUT OF INNER LOOP
        END IF
    END FOR
END FOR

// Output the length of the longest repeated substring
PRINT(longest_repeated_length)

END
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading a single line of input and determines its length without the newline character. 

2. **Outer Loop**: It checks each possible length for substrings, starting from 0 up to one less than the total length of the input.

3. **Inner Loop**: For each length, it examines all starting positions within the string to check for repeated substrings.

4. **Substring Extraction**: It extracts substrings from the given input based on the current starting position and length being evaluated.

5. **Existence Check**: The program checks if the extracted substring appears again in the input, looking only after its current position to ensure itâ€™s a repeat.

6. **Result Update**: If a repeat is found, it updates the longest repeated length accordingly and breaks out of the inner loop to avoid unnecessary checks for shorter lengths.

7. **Output**: Finally, the program outputs the length of the longest repeated substring found during its execution.

### Comments for Clarity:
- The use of `READ_INPUT()` indicates a function to read input, while `GET_LENGTH()` represents a method to get the size of the string.
- `EXTRACT_SUBSTRING()` is a simplified representation of the substring operation, which specifies the desirable part of the input string.
- `EXISTS()` indicates a check for presence in a specific context.

This approach keeps the logic clear and accessible for readers who may not be familiar with the original programming language.
