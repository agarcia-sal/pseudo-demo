To translate the given Python code into high-level pseudocode, we will focus on clearly articulating the purpose of the code, the logic flow, and how the inputs and outputs are managed. Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that captures the essence of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION findLongestRepeatedSubstring(inputString)
    # Get the length of the input string
    SET stringLength TO length of inputString
    INITIALIZE longestRepetitionLength TO 0

    # Iterate over possible lengths for substrings from 0 to stringLength - 1
    FOR l FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO
        # Iterate over each possible starting index of the substring
        FOR i FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO
            # Check if the substring starting at index i with length l exists later in the string
            IF positionOf(inputString FROM index i+1 TO end) OF inputString[l..i] IS NOT -1 THEN
                # If found, update longest repetition length
                SET longestRepetitionLength TO l
                BREAK # Exit inner loop if a repetition is found
            END IF
        END FOR
    END FOR

    # Return the length of the longest repeated substring found
    RETURN longestRepetitionLength
END FUNCTION
```

### Notes on the Pseudocode:
1. **Purpose Clarification:** The function `findLongestRepeatedSubstring` aims to find the length of the longest substring that appears more than once in the input string.

2. **Meaningful Names:** The variables such as `longestRepetitionLength` and `inputString` enhance clarity.

3. **High-Level Abstraction:** We summarize the logical steps and avoid technical specifics of methods like `.find()`.

4. **Control Structures:** The loops and conditional checks are represented clearly using natural language.

5. **Input and Output:** The function takes an `inputString` as input and outputs an integer representing the length of the longest substring that appears more than once.

6. **Structure Consistency:** The pseudocode follows a defined structure extending from function definition to variable initialization and control flow.

7. **Natural Language Usage:** Descriptive phrases replace technical jargon, making it approachable for readers from various backgrounds.

8. **Complexity Context:** We could elaborate on the complexity of searching for substrings if needed, but this pseudocode aims for clarity.

By providing relevant context and maintaining a structured format, this pseudocode accurately captures the functionality of the original Python code.
