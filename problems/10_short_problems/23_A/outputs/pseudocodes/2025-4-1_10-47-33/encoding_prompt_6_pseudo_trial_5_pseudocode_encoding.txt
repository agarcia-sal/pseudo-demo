// Begin program to find the longest repeating substring length
1. Read a line of input and remove the last character (newline).
2. Store the length of the input line in a variable called totalLength.
3. Initialize a variable longestRepeatLength to 0 to track the length of the longest repeating substring.

// Loop through possible substring lengths from 0 to totalLength
4. For each length from 0 to totalLength (inclusive), do the following:
    a. Loop through each starting index from 0 to totalLength (inclusive).
        i. Extract a substring starting from the current index with the current length.
        ii. Check if this substring appears again in the input, starting from the position after the current index.
        iii. If found, set longestRepeatLength to the current length.
        iv. Break out of the inner loop as we found a repeating substring of the current length.

// After checking all lengths, output the longest found repeating substring length
5. Print longestRepeatLength
