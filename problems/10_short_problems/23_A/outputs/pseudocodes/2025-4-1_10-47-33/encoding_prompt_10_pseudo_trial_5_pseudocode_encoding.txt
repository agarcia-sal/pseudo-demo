Hereâ€™s the pseudocode based on the provided code, following the guided steps:

```
1. Import standard input functionality.

2. Read a line of input from standard input and remove the trailing newline character.
3. Set variable 'n' to the length of the input line.
4. Initialize variable 'rv' to 0.  // This will hold the result.

5. FOR each length 'l' from 0 to n-1 DO:
   6. FOR each index 'i' from 0 to n-1 DO:
      7. Extract the substring from 'line' starting at index 'i' with length 'l'.
      8. Check if this substring appears again in 'line' starting from index 'i + 1'.
      9. IF the substring is found THEN:
         10. Set 'rv' to the value of 'l'.
         11. Break out of the inner loop. // Exit the loop for indices 'i' as we found a match.
   
12. Print the value of 'rv'. // Output the result.
```

### Assumptions:
- The input is a string consisting of characters and may include spaces.
- The input is non-empty, and 'n' will be a non-negative integer corresponding to the length of the string.
