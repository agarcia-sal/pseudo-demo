**Purpose**: The code aims to find the length of the longest substring within a given string that appears more than once.

### Pseudocode

1. **Start Program**

2. **Define Input**:
   - Read a line of text from the standard input (excluding the last character).

3. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Set `length_of_line` to the length of the input line.
   - Set `longest_repeated_length` to 0 to keep track of the longest repeating substring length.

4. **Outer Loop** (for each potential substring length from 0 to n-1):
   - For `current_length` from 0 to `length_of_line - 1`:
  
     5. **Inner Loop** (for each possible starting position in the string):
        - For `start_index` from 0 to `length_of_line - 1`:

          6. **Extract Substring**:
             - Get the substring `substring` from `start_index` with a length of `current_length`.

          7. **Check for Repetition**:
             - If `substring` can be found in the input line starting from the position after `start_index`:
               - Set `longest_repeated_length` to `current_length`.
               - Exit the inner loop because we found repetition for the current substring length.

8. **Output Result**:
   - Print the value of `longest_repeated_length`.

**Note**: The code is structured to gradually check all possible lengths of substrings, ensuring to look for any duplicates within the string. The outer loop corresponds to the length of the substrings, while the inner loop inspects specific starting positions of those substrings in the line. The search for a repeated substring involves checking if the substring can be found again in the remaining part of the string, updating the result accordingly.
