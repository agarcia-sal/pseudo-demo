Here is the pseudocode translation of the provided code based on the steps you outlined:

```
BEGIN

  // Step 1: Read input and initialize variables
  SET line TO READ a line of input from standard input
  REMOVE the last character from line
  SET n TO LENGTH of line
  SET rv TO 0 // This variable stores the result

  // Step 2: Iterate through lengths l from 0 to n-1
  FOR l FROM 0 TO n - 1 DO
    // Step 3: Check for substring presence
    FOR i FROM 0 TO n - 1 DO
      // Step 4: Check if the substring exists later in the string
      IF line CONTAINS substring line[i:i+l] starting from index i+1 THEN
        SET rv TO l // Update rv with the current length l
        BREAK // Exit the inner loop as the substring is found
      END IF
    END FOR
  END FOR

  // Step 5: Output the result
  PRINT rv // Display the final value of rv

END
```

### Assumptions:
- The input provided is a string, and we assume it does not include any extra spaces or special characters beyond the general character set.
- The operation `line[i:i+l]` extracts a substring from the string `line` starting at index `i` and spanning `l` characters.
- The check for substring presence uses an appropriate method to verify if the substring exists later in the string.
