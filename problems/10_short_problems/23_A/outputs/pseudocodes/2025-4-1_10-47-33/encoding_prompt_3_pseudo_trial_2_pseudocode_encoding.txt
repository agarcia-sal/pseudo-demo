Here's a structured and clear pseudocode representation based on the given code snippet:

```
BEGIN
    // Read a line of input and remove the trailing newline
    INPUT string line FROM standard input
    SET n TO length of line
    SET repeatedLength TO 0  // This variable will hold the length of the repeated substring

    // Loop through possible lengths of substrings starting from 0 to n-1
    FOR each possibleLength FROM 0 TO n-1 DO
        // Inner loop to evaluate each starting position for substrings of the current possibleLength
        FOR each index FROM 0 TO n-1 DO
            // Extract a substring of length possibleLength starting from the current index
            SET substring TO line[index:index + possibleLength]

            // Check if this substring appears later in the line
            IF substring found in line starting from index + 1 THEN
                SET repeatedLength TO possibleLength
                BREAK // Exit inner loop as we found a repeated substring
            END IF
        END FOR

    END FOR

    // Output the length of the longest repeated substring found
    OUTPUT repeatedLength
END
```

### Breakdown of the Pseudocode:

1. **Initialization**: It reads a string input and initializes the length variable and the aggregated result holder.

2. **Outer Loop**: Iterates through all possible substring lengths from 0 to n-1.

3. **Inner Loop**: For each starting index in the string, it checks for repetition of substrings.

4. **Condition**: It checks if the substring of the current length exists later in the string.

5. **Result Storage**: If a matching substring is found, the length of that substring is stored, and it breaks out of the inner loop.

6. **Final Output**: After checking all possibilities, it outputs the length of the longest found repeated substring. 

This pseudocode maintains clarity of the algorithm's intent while abstracting away specific programming syntax, allowing anyone to follow the logic of the code irrespective of their programming background.
