Here's a clear and understandable pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```
BEGIN

    // Read a line of input from the user and remove the trailing newline character
    INPUT line from standard input
    REMOVE last character from line
    SET length_of_line to the length of line
    INITIALIZE repeat_length to 0

    // Loop through lengths from 0 to length_of_line
    FOR length from 0 to length_of_line - 1 DO

        // Check for all starting positions of substring of this length
        FOR start_position from 0 to length_of_line - 1 DO
            
            // Extract the current substring from the line
            SET current_substring to the substring of line from start_position to (start_position + length)

            // Check if this substring appears again in line starting from the next character
            IF current_substring can be found in line starting from (start_position + 1) THEN
                // Update repeat_length to be the current length if a repeat is found
                SET repeat_length to length
                BREAK OUT OF inner loop

        // Break out of the outer loop if a repeat has been found
        IF repeat_length is not equal to 0 THEN
            BREAK OUT OF outer loop

    // Output the longest length of repeated substring found
    PRINT repeat_length

END
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs and Outputs**: The pseudocode begins by indicating where input is read and how the output is printed, closely mimicking the behavior of the original code.
- **Variable Naming**: Variables have been renamed for clarity. For example, `rv` is renamed to `repeat_length` for better understanding of its purpose.
- **Loops and Conditions**: The structure of nested loops is shown in a way that explains their function and purpose without getting caught in programming syntax.
- **Clarity**: Each step is broken down into logical operations and a comment is provided to explain what each block is doing, enhancing readability and comprehension.
