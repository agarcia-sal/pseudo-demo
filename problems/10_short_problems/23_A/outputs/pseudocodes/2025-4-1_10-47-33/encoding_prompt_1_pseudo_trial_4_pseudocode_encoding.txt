**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Program**
   - Read a line of input from standard input and remove the trailing newline character.
   - Store the length of the input line in a variable called `length`.
   - Initialize a variable `result` to 0.

2. **Main Loop**
   - For each possible substring length `subLength` from 0 to `length - 1`:
     - For each starting position `startIndex` in the input line from 0 to `length - 1`:
       - Extract the substring of `inputLine` starting at `startIndex` with the length `subLength`.
       - Check if this substring appears again in `inputLine` starting from position `startIndex + 1`.
         - If the substring is found:
           - Update `result` to be the current `subLength`.
           - Break out of the inner loop to test the next substring length.

3. **Output the Result**
   - Print the value of `result`, which holds the length of the longest repeating substring.

**Summary of Logic:**
- The program looks for the longest substring in a given input line that appears more than once, starting from different positions in the line. The length of this longest repeating substring is then printed as the result.
