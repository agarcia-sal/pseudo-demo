### Purpose Summary
The goal of this code is to find the longest substring in a given string that appears more than once. The length of this substring will be returned as the output.

### Pseudocode
```
BEGIN

    // Read a line of input from the user
    INPUT line

    // Remove the newline character from the end of the input
    line = REMOVE_NEWLINE(line)

    // Calculate the length of the input string
    n = LENGTH(line)

    // Initialize a variable to hold the length of the longest repeated substring
    longestRepeatedLength = 0

    // Loop through substrings of increasing lengths
    FOR length FROM 0 TO n - 1 DO
    
        // Check all starting positions for the substring of the current length
        FOR startPosition FROM 0 TO n - 1 DO

            // Extract the substring from 'startPosition' of 'length'
            currentSubstring = SUBSTRING(line, startPosition, startPosition + length)

            // Check if this substring appears again in the string after its starting position
            IF (INDEX_OF(line, currentSubstring, startPosition + 1) != -1) THEN
                
                // If the substring is found again, update the longest repeated length
                longestRepeatedLength = length
                BREAK // Exit this inner loop as we found a repeat

        END FOR
        
    END FOR

    // Print the length of the longest repeated substring found
    PRINT longestRepeatedLength

END
```

### Comments for Clarity
- **INPUT line**: This line suggests reading input from the user.
- **REMOVE_NEWLINE(line)**: This operation indicates the removal of any trailing newline characters.
- **LENGTH(line)**: This function calculates the total number of characters in the string.
- **SUBSTRING(line, startPosition, startPosition + length)**: This operation retrieves a specific part of the string based on the starting position and length.
- **INDEX_OF(line, substring, startPosition + 1)**: This function checks if the currently selected substring can be found in the main string starting from the position right after where it was first found.

### Example Usage
- If the input string is "abcabc", the output would be 3, as "abc" is the longest repeated substring.

This pseudocode is designed to be accessible to readers who may not be familiar with programming languages, using plain language to explain the logic and flow of the original code.
