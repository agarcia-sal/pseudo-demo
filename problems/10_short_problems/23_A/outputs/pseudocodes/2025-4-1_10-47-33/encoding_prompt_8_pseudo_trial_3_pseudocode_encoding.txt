### Purpose
The goal of this code is to determine the length of the longest prefix of a given string that appears again as a substring later in the string.

### Pseudocode

```
BEGIN

    // Read a line of input, excluding the last character (newline)
    SET inputString TO READ_INPUT()
    
    // Get the length of the input string
    SET stringLength TO LENGTH(inputString)
    
    // Initialize a variable to store the result
    SET longestPrefixLength TO 0

    // Loop through potential prefix lengths from 0 up to stringLength
    FOR currentLength FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO

        // Check every starting position in the string
        FOR startPosition FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO
            
            // Check if the substring starting at startPosition of length currentLength
            // exists again elsewhere in the string
            IF FIND_SUBSTRING(inputString, SUBSTRING(inputString, startPosition, currentLength), startPosition + 1) IS NOT -1 THEN
            
                // Update the longest prefix length if a match is found
                SET longestPrefixLength TO currentLength
                BREAK // Exit the inner loop if a match is found
            END IF
            
        END FOR // End of startPosition loop

    END FOR // End of currentLength loop

    // Output the length of the longest prefix found
    OUTPUT(longestPrefixLength)

END
```

### Annotations
- `READ_INPUT()`: A placeholder function that represents reading an input line from standard input.
- `LENGTH(inputString)`: Specifies getting the number of characters in the input string.
- `FIND_SUBSTRING(string, substring, start)`: Represents a function that returns the starting index of the substring in the string if found, or -1 if not found.
- `SUBSTRING(string, start, length)`: Represents a function that extracts a part of the string starting at `start` index with specified `length`.

### Additional Explanation
- The outer loop checks potential prefix lengths incrementally, starting from 0.
- The inner loop iterates through the string's characters to identify a matching substring that appears again after the current prefix.
- When a match is found, the longest prefix length is updated accordingly, and the program breaks out of the inner loop to continue checking for longer prefixes.
- Finally, the length of the longest prefix that satisfies the condition is printed out as the result.
