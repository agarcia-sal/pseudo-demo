Below is the structured pseudocode that captures the intent and flow of the provided code snippet without getting lost in specific syntax:

```
BEGIN Main

    // Read input line from standard input and remove the trailing newline
    INPUT inputLine FROM standard input
    Remove trailing newline from inputLine
    SET lineLength TO LENGTH of inputLine
    SET repeatIndex TO 0

    // Loop over lengths of possible substrings
    FOR each length FROM 0 TO lineLength - 1 DO

        // Inner loop to check each starting position of the substring
        FOR each startIndex FROM 0 TO lineLength - 1 DO
            
            // Create a substring of current length starting at startIndex
            SET currentSubstring TO inputLine[startIndex: startIndex + length]
            
            // Check if the substring appears in the rest of the string after startIndex
            IF currentSubstring EXISTS in inputLine starting from index (startIndex + 1) THEN
                // Update repeatIndex to the current length if a repeat is found
                SET repeatIndex TO length
                BREAK OUT OF inner loop
    
        END FOR
        
    END FOR

    // Output the highest length of the repeated substring found
    PRINT repeatIndex

END Main
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by reading input from the user, similar to the original code but expressed in a more generic way without explicit syntax.
   
2. **Variable Initialization:** Important variables are clearly defined, such as `lineLength` representing the length of the input string and `repeatIndex` initialized to store the length of the longest repeating substring.

3. **Looping Structure:** The nested loops are articulated to iterate over all potential substring lengths and starting indices.

4. **Substring Checks:** The condition checking if the substring exists is described, conveying the logic without specific language syntax.

5. **Output:** Finally, the pseudocode concludes with a simple print statement to show the result, maintaining clarity in the output process.

This structured approach ensures that anyone reading it can follow the logical progression of the algorithm without needing background knowledge of any specific programming language.
