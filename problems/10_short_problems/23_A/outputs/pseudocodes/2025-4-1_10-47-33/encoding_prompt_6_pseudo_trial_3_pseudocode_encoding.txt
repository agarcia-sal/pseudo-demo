Here is the pseudocode that translates the provided code while focusing on clarity and comprehensibility:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Read a line of input from the user and remove the trailing newline character
    READ inputLine

    // Determine the length of the input line
    SET lengthOfLine TO LENGTH OF inputLine

    // Initialize a variable to hold the result
    SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO 0

    // Loop through possible substring lengths from 0 to lengthOfLine - 1
    FOR substringLength FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO

        // Loop through each starting position in the input line
        FOR startIndex FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO

            // Extract a substring from the input line starting at startIndex with a given length
            SET currentSubstring TO EXTRACT substring from inputLine starting at startIndex with length substringLength

            // Check if the current substring can be found elsewhere in the line after its starting position
            IF currentSubstring EXISTS IN inputLine starting from (startIndex + 1) THEN

                // If found, update the longest repeated substring length
                SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO substringLength
                BREAK OUT OF INNER LOOP  // Stop checking other starting indices for this substring length

            END IF

        END FOR

    END FOR

    // Output the length of the longest repeated substring found
    PRINT longestRepeatedSubstringLength

END
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by reading an input line and determining its length, similar to what the original code does.

2. **Nested Loops**: There are two nested loops where the first one checks for different lengths of substrings, and the second one checks each possible starting position for those lengths.

3. **Substring Extraction and Checking**: The pseudocode describes how it extracts substrings and checks if they exist later in the input line.

4. **Result Updating**: If a repeated substring is found, it updates the result and breaks out of the inner loop to avoid unnecessary checks.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the length of the longest repeated substring found. 

This format facilitates understanding of the algorithm without the technical complexity of specific programming syntax.
