Here is the high-level pseudocode that accurately describes the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION findLongestRepeatedSubstring(inputString)
    // Initialize the length of the input string
    SET stringLength TO LENGTH of inputString
    // Initialize the variable to store the length of the longest repeated substring
    SET longestRepeatedLength TO 0
    
    // Loop over each possible length of substring, starting from 0 to stringLength - 1
    FOR currentLength FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO
        // Loop over each starting position of the substring
        FOR startingIndex FROM 0 TO stringLength - 1 DO
            // Check if the substring exists again in the string after the current starting index
            IF substring inputString[startingIndex:startingIndex + currentLength] exists in inputString, starting from startingIndex + 1 THEN
                // Update longestRepeatedLength to currentLength, indicating a repeated substring was found
                SET longestRepeatedLength TO currentLength
                // Exit the inner loop once a repeated substring is found at this length
                BREAK OUT OF inner FOR LOOP
            END IF
        END FOR
    END FOR

    // Return the length of the longest repeated substring found
    RETURN longestRepeatedLength
END FUNCTION

// The expected input is a string from standard input (stdin)
// The expected output is the length of the longest repeated substring in that input string
```

### Explanation of Complexity
- The core logic uses two nested loops, where the outer loop iterates through all possible lengths of substrings and the inner loop traverses the string to check for occurrences of these substrings given specific conditions. The overall time complexity can be considered O(n^3) in the worst case, due to the substring checks involving potentially scanning the input multiple times for each length.
