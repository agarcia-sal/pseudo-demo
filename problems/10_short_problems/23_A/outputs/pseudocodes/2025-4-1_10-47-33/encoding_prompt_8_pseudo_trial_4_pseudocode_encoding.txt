**Purpose Summary**: The code aims to find the length of the longest repeated substring in a given string by checking for duplicates.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Initialize Input**: 
   - Read a line of text input from the user (excluding any trailing newline).

2. **Set Variables**: 
   - Determine the length of the input string and store it in a variable named `lengthOfInput`.
   - Create a variable `maxLength` to keep track of the maximum length of a repeated substring and set it to 0.

3. **Outer Loop for Lengths**: 
   - For each possible length `currentLength` from 0 to `lengthOfInput - 1`:
     - (This loop checks for substrings of increasing lengths.)

4. **Inner Loop for Starting Positions**: 
   - For each starting position `startIndex` from 0 to `lengthOfInput - 1`:
     - (This loop examines every starting point for substrings of the current length.)

5. **Extract Substring**: 
   - Create a substring `substring` using characters from `startIndex` to `startIndex + currentLength`.

6. **Check for Repeats**: 
   - If the substring can be found in the input string starting from `startIndex + 1` (i.e., any subsequent position):
     - Update `maxLength` to `currentLength` to reflect the longest found so far.
     - Exit the inner loop as we only need to find the existence of this substring.

7. **Output Result**: 
   - After checking all lengths and starting positions, print the maximum length of the repeated substring found (`maxLength`).

**Comments**: 
- The `find` method is used to check if a substring appears after its starting index.
- The loops ensure every possibility is covered, and the nested structure allows for checking substrings of different lengths efficiently.

START

// Step 1: Read input
Read inputLine from user

// Step 2: Initialize variables
lengthOfInput = length of inputLine
maxLength = 0 // To track the length of the longest repeated substring

// Step 3: Check for repeated substrings
FOR currentLength from 0 to lengthOfInput - 1 DO
    FOR startIndex from 0 to lengthOfInput - 1 DO
        substring = extract substring from inputLine starting at startIndex for currentLength
        
        // Step 6: Check if the substring appears again after its position
        IF substring is found in inputLine starting at position (startIndex + 1) THEN
            maxLength = currentLength // Update maxLength
            BREAK out of inner loop // No need to check further
        
END FOR

// Step 7: Output the result
PRINT maxLength

END
