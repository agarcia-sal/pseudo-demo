### Purpose:
The primary goal of this code is to determine the length of the longest substring in a given line that appears more than once.

### Pseudocode:
```
START

// Read input from the user
READ input_string FROM standard input
REMOVE the last character from input_string (which is a newline)

// Get the length of the input string
SET length_of_string TO the length of input_string
SET longest_repeated_length TO 0

// Loop through possible substring lengths
FOR each length FROM 0 TO length_of_string - 1 DO
    // Nested loop to check every position in the string
    FOR each position FROM 0 TO length_of_string - 1 DO
        // Extract the substring of the current length starting from the current position
        SET current_substring TO the substring of input_string from position TO position + length
        
        // Check if this substring appears again in the string, 
        // starting just after its current position
        IF current_substring CAN BE FOUND in input_string starting from position + 1 THEN
            // Update the longest length if a repeated substring is found
            SET longest_repeated_length TO length
            BREAK OUT OF the inner loop // No need to check further for this length
        END IF
    END FOR
END FOR

// Output the length of the longest repeated substring found
PRINT longest_repeated_length

END
```

### Explanation of Key Concepts:
- **Input Reading**: The program reads a line of text from user input, excluding the newline character.
- **Looping through lengths**: The outer loop iterates over possible lengths of substrings, starting from 0 up to the last character in the string.
- **Checking for Substring Repetition**: The inner loop examines each possible starting position for the current substring length to see if that substring appears again later in the string.
- **Updating Result**: Whenever a repeated substring is found, the length is recorded, and the search for longer lengths continues.
- **Output**: The final result, which is the length of the longest repeated substring, is printed at the end.

This pseudocode is designed to be clear and accessible, regardless of the reader's familiarity with programming.
