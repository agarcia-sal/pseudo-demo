### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling:** The line is read from standard input and is prepared by removing the newline at the end.
2. **Initialization:** The length of the line and a variable to hold the result are set.
3. **Outer Loop:** This iterates over all possible substring lengths from 0 up to the length of the input string.
4. **Inner Loop:** This checks each position in the string to find substrings of the current length `l`.
5. **Finding Repeats:** Through the condition, the code checks if the current substring exists later in the line. If found, it updates the result and exits the inner loop.
6. **Output:** Finally, the longest length of the substrings that were found to repeat is printed.
