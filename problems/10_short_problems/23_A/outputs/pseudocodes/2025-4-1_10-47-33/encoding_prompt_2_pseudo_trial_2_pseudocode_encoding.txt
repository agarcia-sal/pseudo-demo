**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Obtain a line of text from standard input and remove the trailing newline character.
   - Determine the length of the input line, storing it as the variable `lineLength`.

2. **Initialize Variable:**
   - Set a variable `maxLength` to zero. This will track the maximum length of the substring found with repetitions.

3. **Outer Loop:**
   - For each possible substring length `currentLength` starting from 0 up to `lineLength` (exclusive):
     1. **Inner Loop:**
        - For each character index `currentIndex` within the range of `lineLength`:
          1. **Extract Substring:**
             - Create a substring `subString` starting at `currentIndex` and extending for `currentLength` characters.
          2. **Check for Repetition:**
             - Look for the occurrence of `subString` in the input line, starting the search after `currentIndex`.
          3. **Update Maximum Length:**
             - If the substring is found, update `maxLength` to be equal to `currentLength` and exit the inner loop.

4. **Output Result:**
   - Display the value of `maxLength` which indicates the length of the longest repeated substring found.
