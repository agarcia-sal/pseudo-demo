**Purpose of the Code**: The code aims to find the length of the longest substring that appears more than once in a given string.

**Pseudocode**:

```
START

// Read a line of input and remove the trailing newline character
READ input_string FROM standard input
SET length_of_input AS length of input_string
SET longest_repeated_length AS 0

// Loop through all possible substring lengths
FOR substring_length FROM 0 TO length_of_input - 1 DO
    // Check each starting position for the substring
    FOR starting_position FROM 0 TO length_of_input - 1 DO
        // Extract the substring based on current length and starting position
        SET current_substring AS substring of input_string from starting_position with length substring_length
        
        // Look for the occurrence of this substring starting after the current position
        IF current_substring appears in input_string starting from position starting_position + 1 THEN
            // If found, update the longest repeated length
            SET longest_repeated_length AS substring_length
            BREAK out of the starting position loop
        END IF
    END FOR
END FOR

// Output the length of the longest repeating substring found
PRINT longest_repeated_length

END
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Start by reading the input and setting necessary variables to keep track of string length and the longest repeated substring length.
   
2. **Outer Loop**: Go through all possible substring lengths from 0 to the total length of the string minus one.

3. **Inner Loop**: For each substring length, check each position in the string to extract substrings.

4. **Substring Search**: Verify if the extracted substring appears later in the string, indicating that it is repeated.

5. **Update Longest Length**: If a repeated substring is found, update the maximum found length and exit the inner loop to continue with the next substring length.

6. **Output Result**: Finally, print the length of the longest substring that has been found to repeat. 

This approach effectively breaks down the logic, ensuring clarity and comprehensibility while still capturing the intended functionality of the original code.
