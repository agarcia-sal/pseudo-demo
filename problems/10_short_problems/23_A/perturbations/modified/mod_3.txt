Here is a structured pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided Python code snippet:

```
BEGIN

// Read input line from standard input
INPUT inputLine

// Determine the length of the input line
SET lengthOfLine TO LENGTH(inputLine)

// Initialize variable to hold the result
SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO 0

// Loop through possible substring lengths from 0 to lengthOfLine - 1
FOR substringLength FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO

// Check for repeated substrings of the current length
FOR startIndex FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO
    
// Extract the substring starting at startIndex with length substringLength
SET currentSubstring TO SUBSTRING(inputLine, startIndex, substringLength)

// Search for the currentSubstring in the remainder of the input line
IF currentSubstring IS FOUND IN inputLine AFTER startIndex THEN

// Update the longest repeated substring length
SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO substringLength
BREAK // Exit the inner loop if a repeat is found

END IF
    
END FOR // End of inner loop

END FOR // End of outer loop

// Output the length of the longest repeated substring found
OUTPUT longestRepeatedSubstringLength

END
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

1. **Input**: The code begins by reading an input string.
2. **Length Calculation**: It calculates the length of the string to determine the range for substring exploration.
3. **Search for Repeated Substrings**: It uses nested loops to check all possible starting positions for substrings of increasing lengths to see if they can be found later in the string.
4. **Update Result**: If a repeated substring is found, it updates the result and breaks out of the inner loop to explore longer substrings.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the length of the longest repeated substring found.

This pseudocode effectively communicates the logic of the original code without getting bogged down in programming-specific syntax, making it accessible for those reading it for comprehension.
