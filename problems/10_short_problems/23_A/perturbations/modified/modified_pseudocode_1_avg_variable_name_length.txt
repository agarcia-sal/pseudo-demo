**Purpose of the Code**: The code aims to find the length of the longest substring that appears more than once in a given string.

**Pseudocode**:

```
START

// Read a line of input and remove the trailing newline character
READ inp FROM standard input
SET inp_len AS length of inp
SET lon AS 0

// Loop through all possible substring lengths
FOR sub FROM 0 TO inp_len - 1 DO
    // Check each starting position for the substring
    FOR star FROM 0 TO inp_len - 1 DO
        // Extract the substring based on current length and starting position
        SET cur AS substring of inp from star with length sub
        
        // Look for the occurrence of this substring starting after the current position
        IF cur appears in inp starting from position star + 1 THEN
            // If found, update the longest repeated length
            SET lon AS sub
            BREAK out of the starting position loop
        END IF
    END FOR
END FOR

// Output the length of the longest repeating substring found
PRINT lon

END
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Start by reading the input and setting necessary variables to keep track of string length and the longest repeated substring length.
   
2. **Outer Loop**: Go through all possible substring lengths from 0 to the total length of the string minus one.

3. **Inner Loop**: For each substring length, check each position in the string to extract substrings.

4. **Substring Search**: Verify if the extracted substring appears later in the string, indicating that it is repeated.

5. **Update Longest Length**: If a repeated substring is found, update the maximum found length and exit the inner loop to continue with the next substring length.

6. **Output Result**: Finally, print the length of the longest substring that has been found to repeat. 

This approach effectively breaks down the logic, ensuring clarity and comprehensibility while still capturing the intended functionality of the original code.
