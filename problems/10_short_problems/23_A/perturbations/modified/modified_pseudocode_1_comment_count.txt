**Pseudocode**:

```
START

READ input_string FROM standard input
SET length_of_input AS length of input_string
SET longest_repeated_length AS 0

FOR substring_length FROM 0 TO length_of_input - 1 DO
    FOR starting_position FROM 0 TO length_of_input - 1 DO
        SET current_substring AS substring of input_string from starting_position with length substring_length
        
        IF current_substring appears in input_string starting from position starting_position + 1 THEN
            SET longest_repeated_length AS substring_length
            BREAK out of the starting position loop
        END IF
    END FOR
END FOR

PRINT longest_repeated_length

END
```
