**Purpose Summary:**
The primary goal of this code is to find the length of the longest substring that appears more than once in a given input string.

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
BEGIN

  // Read a line of input from the user and remove the trailing newline character
  INPUT line FROM user
  REMOVE last character from line (if it's a newline) 
  SET length_of_line to the length of line
  SET longest_repeating_length to 0

  // Loop through all possible lengths of substrings
  FOR each substring_length from 0 to length_of_line - 1 DO
    // Check for each starting position in the string
    FOR each starting_position from 0 to length_of_line - 1 DO
      // Extract the substring from the current starting_position of length substring_length
      SET current_substring to the substring of line starting at starting_position with length substring_length
      
      // Check if the current substring exists anywhere after the current starting position
      IF the position of current_substring found in line starting from starting_position + 1 is NOT -1 THEN
        SET longest_repeating_length to substring_length
        BREAK out of the loop (since we found a repeating substring of this length)
      ENDIF
    ENDFOR
  ENDFOR

  // Output the length of the longest repeating substring found
  PRINT longest_repeating_length

END
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The outer loop iterates over possible substring lengths starting from 0 up to the length of the input string minus 1.
- The inner loop checks each starting position in the input string for substrings of the current length.
- The conditional check determines if the same substring appears again later in the string.
- If a repeating substring is found, it updates the longest found length and exits the inner loop early to avoid unnecessary checks. 
- Finally, it outputs the length of the longest repeating substring found. 

This pseudocode captures the essence of the original code while enhancing readability and accessibility for those who may not be familiar with programming syntax.
