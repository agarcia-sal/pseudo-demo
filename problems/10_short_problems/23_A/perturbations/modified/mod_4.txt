Here is a structured pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided Python code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    INPUT inputLine

    SET lengthOfLine TO LENGTH(inputLine)
    
    SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO 0

    FOR substringLength FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO

        FOR startIndex FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO
            
            SET currentSubstring TO SUBSTRING(inputLine, startIndex, substringLength)

            IF currentSubstring IS FOUND IN inputLine AFTER startIndex THEN
                
                SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO substringLength
                BREAK 

            END IF
            
        END FOR 

    END FOR 

    OUTPUT longestRepeatedSubstringLength

END
```
