Here is a structured pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided Python code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Read input line from standard input
    INPUT n

    // Determine the length of the input line
    SET l TO LENGTH(n)
    
    // Initialize variable to hold the result
    SET m TO 0

    // Loop through possible substring lengths from 0 to l - 1
    FOR s FROM 0 TO l - 1 DO

        // Check for repeated substrings of the current length
        FOR start FROM 0 TO l - 1 DO
            
            // Extract the substring starting at start with length s
            SET c TO SUBSTRING(n, start, s)

            // Search for the currentSubstring in the remainder of the input line
            IF c IS FOUND IN n AFTER start THEN
                
                // Update the longest repeated substring length
                SET m TO s
                BREAK // Exit the inner loop if a repeat is found

            END IF
            
        END FOR // End of inner loop

    END FOR // End of outer loop

    // Output the length of the longest repeated substring found
    OUTPUT m

END
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

1. **Input**: The code begins by reading an input string.
2. **Length Calculation**: It calculates the length of the string to determine the range for substring exploration.
3. **Search for Repeated Substrings**: It uses nested loops to check all possible starting positions for substrings of increasing lengths to see if they can be found later in the string.
4. **Update Result**: If a repeated substring is found, it updates the result and breaks out of the inner loop to explore longer substrings.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the length of the longest repeated substring found.

This pseudocode effectively communicates the logic of the original code without getting bogged down in programming-specific syntax, making it accessible for those reading it for comprehension.
