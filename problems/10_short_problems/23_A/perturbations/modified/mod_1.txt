Here is a structured pseudocode that captures the intent and logic of the provided Python code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Read input line from standard input
    INPUT inputLine

    // Determine the length of the input line
    SET lengthOfLine TO LENGTH(inputLine)
    
    // Initialize variable to hold the result
    SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO 0

    // Loop through possible substring lengths from 0 to lengthOfLine - 1
    FOR substringLength FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO

        // Check for repeated substrings of the current length
        FOR startIndex FROM 0 TO lengthOfLine - 1 DO
            
            // Extract the substring starting at startIndex with length substringLength
            SET currentSubstring TO SUBSTRING(inputLine, startIndex, substringLength)

            // Search for the currentSubstring in the remainder of the input line
            IF currentSubstring IS FOUND IN inputLine AFTER startIndex THEN
                
                // Update the longest repeated substring length
                SET longestRepeatedSubstringLength TO substringLength
                BREAK // Exit the inner loop if a repeat is found

            END IF
            
        END FOR // End of inner loop

    END FOR // End of outer loop

    // Output the length of the longest repeated substring found
    OUTPUT longestRepeatedSubstringLength

END
```
