Here's a structured pseudocode version of the provided code, focusing on clarity and intent:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Input the number of elements
    SET numberOfElements TO INTEGER INPUT

    // Step 2: Create a list to track boolean values, initialized to True
    CREATE booleanList WITH size numberOfElements FILLED WITH True

    // Initialize variables for iteration
    SET index TO 0
    SET iterator TO 1

    // Step 3: Loop through a range of values
    WHILE iterator IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 500000 DO

        // Step 4: If current boolean value is True
        IF booleanList[index] IS True THEN
            // Mark it as False
            SET booleanList[index] TO False
        END IF
        
        // Increment iterator
        INCREMENT iterator BY 1

        // Calculate the next index to modify using the modulo operation
        SET index TO (index + iterator) MOD numberOfElements
    END WHILE

    // Step 5: Create a new list of remaining True values
    SET remainingTrueValues TO NEW LIST OF booleanList WHERE value IS True

    // Step 6: Check if there are any True values left
    IF length OF remainingTrueValues IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by reading the number of elements from the user input.
   
2. **List Initialization:** A boolean list is created to represent the state (True or False) of each index.

3. **Loop Through Values:** A loop is established that continues for a maximum of 500,000 iterations, controlling access to the boolean list.

4. **Conditional Logic:** Inside the loop, the code checks the current boolean value and updates it accordingly. The method for updating the index to be modified uses a formula to ensure it wraps around correctly.

5. **Post-Loop Processing:** After the loop, a new list of remaining True values is created, and its length is checked.

6. **Output Statement:** Finally, a check determines if any True values remain, leading to the output of 'YES' or 'NO'. 

This pseudocode captures the core logic and structure of the original code while avoiding language-specific syntax, ensuring it's understandable to someone unfamiliar with the programming details.
