Here's a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided code that accurately captures its intent and operations:

```
FUNCTION checkCondition(n)
    // Initialize an array to track boolean values
    SET booleanArray TO array of size n filled with True
    INITIALIZE index j TO 0
    INITIALIZE counter i TO 1
    
    // Iterate through a range up to 500,000
    WHILE i <= 500000 DO
        // If the current position in the boolean array is True
        IF booleanArray[j] IS True THEN
            // Mark this position as False
            booleanArray[j] = False
        END IF
        
        // Increment counter i
        INCREMENT i BY 1
        
        // Update index j using modulo operation to wrap around
        SET j TO (j + i) MOD n
    END WHILE
    
    // Collect all True values from the boolean array
    SET trueValues TO list of elements in booleanArray where value is True
    
    // Check if there are any remaining True values
    IF length of trueValues EQUALS 0 THEN
        OUTPUT 'YES'
    ELSE
        OUTPUT 'NO'
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the pseudocode:

1. **Input:** The function `checkCondition` receives an integer `n` representing the size of a boolean array.
   
2. **Initialization:** A boolean array of size `n` is created, initialized to `True`. Two counters, `j` and `i`, are initialized for tracking the position in the array and iterating through numbers respectively.

3. **Loop Structure:** The loop runs up to `500,000`. Inside the loop:
   - If the value at index `j` in the boolean array is `True`, it is set to `False`.
   - `i` is incremented in each iteration, and `j` is updated using the modular arithmetic to limit it to the size of the array `n`.

4. **Output Collection:** After exiting the loop, all `True` values are collected into the `trueValues` list.

5. **Final Check and Output:** If no `True` values remain in the list, it outputs `'YES'`, otherwise it outputs `'NO'`.

This pseudocode is structured to provide clarity on the code's logic, while using accessible language and meaningful variable names for better comprehensibility.
