**Purpose Summary:**  
The goal of the code is to manipulate a list of boolean values to determine if all values can be marked as false through a series of operations. It then checks if any true values remain in the list and outputs either 'YES' or 'NO' based on this condition.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive the Input**  
   Get an integer value `n` from the user which represents the size of a list.

2. **Initialize List**  
   Create a list called `booleanList` with `n` elements, all starting as `True`.  
   Set a variable `currentIndex` to 0.  
   Set a variable `step` to 1.

3. **Loop Until Step Limit**  
   While `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the value at `currentIndex` in `booleanList` is `True`:
     - If it is `True`, change it to `False`.
   - Increment `step` by 1.
   - Update `currentIndex` to the next position calculated as `(currentIndex + step) % n` (this ensures the index wraps around if it exceeds `n`).

4. **Check Remaining True Values**  
   Create a new list `remainingTrueValues` containing all elements from `booleanList` that are still `True`.

5. **Output Result**  
   If the length of `remainingTrueValues` is 0 (i.e., there are no True values left):
     - Print 'YES'
   Else:
     - Print 'NO'

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The boolean list is used to keep track of which elements have been processed (turned from `True` to `False`).
- The `currentIndex` is updated based on a progressively increasing step size to effectively mark positions in the list, cycling back to the start when necessary.
- The final check assesses whether any `True` values remain after processing.

This approach simplifies the original code while preserving its logic and functionality, making it easier to understand for those not familiar with the specific programming language syntax.
