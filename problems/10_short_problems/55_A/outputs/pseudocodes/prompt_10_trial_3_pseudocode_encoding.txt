Here is the clear and concise pseudocode based on the provided code, following the guided steps:

```plaintext
1. SET n TO user input as an integer
2. INITIALIZE list b OF SIZE n WITH all elements set to True
3. SET j TO 0
4. SET i TO 1

5. WHILE i IS LESS THAN or EQUAL TO 500000 DO
   a. IF b[j] IS True THEN
      - SET b[j] TO False
   b. INCREMENT i BY 1
   c. SET j TO (j + i) MOD n

6. SET x TO a list containing all elements in b that are True

7. IF length of x IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
   a. PRINT "YES"
8. ELSE
   a. PRINT "NO"
```

### Assumptions:
- The variable `n` represents a non-negative integer input by the user.
- The list `b` uses zero-based indexing for the boolean values (True/False).
- The modulo operation adjusts the index `j` to ensure it wraps around the list size `n`.
