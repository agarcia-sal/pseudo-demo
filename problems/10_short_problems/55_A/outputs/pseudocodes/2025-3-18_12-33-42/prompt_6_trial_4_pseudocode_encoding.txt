Here's the pseudocode that clearly represents the original algorithm with an emphasis on readability and clarity:

```
BEGIN

    // Read an integer input which determines the size of the array
    SET arraySize TO input as integer

    // Create a list of boolean values initialized to True, with a length equal to arraySize
    SET booleanList TO a list of True values with size arraySize

    // Initialize two counter variables: j for the index and i for the increment
    SET index TO 0
    SET increment TO 1

    // Loop until increment exceeds 500000
    WHILE increment is less than or equal to 500000 DO

        // If the current position in the boolean list is True
        IF booleanList[index] is True THEN
            // Mark the current position as False
            SET booleanList[index] TO False
        ENDIF

        // Move to the next increment
        INCREMENT increment by 1

        // Update the index using a modulo operation for circular access
        SET index TO (index + increment) MOD arraySize
    ENDWHILE

    // Filter the boolean list to find positions still marked as True
    SET filteredTrueValues TO a list of values from booleanList where the value is True

    // Check if there are any True values remaining after the loop
    IF LENGTH OF filteredTrueValues is 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'
    ENDIF

END
```

### Explanation
- **Input Handling**: The pseudocode starts by reading the number of elements (n) which shapes the subsequent logic.
- **Boolean List Initialization**: It initializes an array-like structure (booleanList) filled with True, reflecting the approach of the original code.
- **Main Logic Loop**: It has a while loop controlled by the increment value, which manages the index navigation through the list.
- **Conditional Logic**: Within the loop, it states clearly what happens when a True is found (it becomes False).
- **Final Check**: After processing, it checks for any remaining True values in the booleanList and prints a response based on that check.

The overall flow mirrors the original code logic while ensuring a high level of understanding and approachability for anyone reviewing it.
