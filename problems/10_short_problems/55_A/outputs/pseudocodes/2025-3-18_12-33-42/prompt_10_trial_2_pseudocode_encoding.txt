Here is the pseudocode translated from the provided code, structured according to the given guidelines:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Initialize variables
    SET n TO integer input from the user
    CREATE a list b of size n, initialized with True
    SET j TO 0
    SET i TO 1

    // Step 2: Iterate while i is less than or equal to 500000
    WHILE (i â‰¤ 500000) DO

        // Step 3: Check if the current position j in list b is True
        IF (b[j] is True) THEN
            SET b[j] TO False
        ENDIF
        
        // Step 4: Update the variables for the next iteration
        INCREMENT i BY 1
        SET j TO (j + i) MOD n   // Wrap around the index using modulo operation
    ENDWHILE

    // Step 5: Filter the list to find remaining True values
    CREATE a new list x with elements from b that are True

    // Step 6: Check the length of the filtered list x
    IF (length of x is 0) THEN
        PRINT 'YES' // No True values found
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'  // Some True values found
    ENDIF

END
```

### Assumptions:
- The variable `n` is assumed to be a non-negative integer.
- The list `b` is assumed to have indices from `0` to `n-1`.
- The modulo operation is properly defined for wrapping around the list indices.
- The input method for `n` is assumed to always return a valid integer.
