**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program**
2. **Input** the total number of elements `n`.
3. **Create a list** called `isUnmarked` with `n` elements, all initialized to `True`.
4. **Set variable** `currentIndex` to 0.
5. **Set variable** `step` to 1.
6. **While loop**: Continue as long as `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - **If** `isUnmarked[currentIndex]` is `True`:
     - Set `isUnmarked[currentIndex]` to `False` (mark it as processed).
   - **Increment** `step` by 1.
   - **Update** `currentIndex` to `(currentIndex + step) % n` (wrap around the index if necessary).
7. **Create a new list** called `unmarkedIndices` that contains all values from `isUnmarked` that are still `True`.
8. **If** the length of `unmarkedIndices` is 0:
   - **Output** 'YES' (indicating all indices were marked).
9. **Else**:
   - **Output** 'NO' (indicating there are still unmarked indices).
10. **End the program**.
