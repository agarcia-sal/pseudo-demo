Here is the pseudocode that translates the provided Python code, capturing its intentions and operations in a clear, structured manner:

```
FUNCTION CheckBooleanArray(n)
    INITIALIZE boolean array b with size n, all set to True
    INITIALIZE variable j to 0
    INITIALIZE variable i to 1

    WHILE i is less than or equal to 500000 DO
        IF b[j] is True THEN
            SET b[j] to False
        END IF
        INCREMENT i by 1
        SET j to (j + i) modulo n
    END WHILE

    INITIALIZE array x to contain all elements from b that are True
    IF the length of x is 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Function Name:** `CheckBooleanArray` signifies that the purpose of the function is to check and manipulate an array of boolean values.
- **Input:** It takes an integer `n`, representing the size of the boolean array.
- **Array Initialization:** An array called `b` of size `n` is initialized with all elements set to `True`.
- **Loop and Condition:** A loop runs up to `500000`, modifying the array based on the index calculated from `j` and `i`. Each time a `True` value is found in `b`, it is set to `False`.
- **Index Calculation:** The next index is calculated using the formula `(j + i) % n`, ensuring that the index wraps around when it reaches the end of the array.
- **Final Check:** After the loop, the function creates a list `x` containing all `True` values from `b`. If there are no `True` values left, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This pseudocode maintains a high-level overview of the logic while being easy to understand for readers with varying degrees of programming knowledge.
