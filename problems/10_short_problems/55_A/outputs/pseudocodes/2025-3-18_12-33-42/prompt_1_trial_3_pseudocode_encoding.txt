**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input**: Read an integer value `n` (the size of the list).
2. **Initialize**: Create a boolean list `b` of length `n`, with all values set to `True`. This list will track the status of each index.
3. **Initialize Counters**: Set `j` to 0 (to track the current index in `b`), and set `i` to 1 (to define the step size).
4. **Loop**: Repeat the following while `i` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the value at index `j` in list `b` is `True` (meaning this position is still considered "active").
     - If it is `True`, change it to `False` to mark it as "inactive".
   - Increment `i` by 1 (this will increase the step size on subsequent iterations).
   - Update `j` to be the new index calculated by adding `i` to the current value of `j`, then taking the result modulo `n` (to wrap around if needed).
5. **Check Results**: Create a new list `x` containing all the `True` values from `b` (these represent the active indices).
6. **Output**: 
   - If the length of list `x` is 0 (meaning there are no active indices), print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

**Overview**: The algorithm continuously marks indices in the list `b` as inactive based on a defined step size and then checks if any indices remain active after the process, determining the output based on this condition.
