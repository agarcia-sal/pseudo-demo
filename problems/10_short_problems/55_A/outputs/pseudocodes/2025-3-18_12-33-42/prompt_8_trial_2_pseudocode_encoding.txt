**Purpose**: The goal of this code is to determine whether all values in a boolean list can be set to False based on a specific pattern of iteration over a series of steps; if not, it outputs 'NO', otherwise it outputs 'YES'.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Get Input Value**:
    - Prompt the user to enter an integer `n`.
  
2. **Initialize List**:
    - Create a list named `booleanList` of size `n`, where all entries start as True.

3. **Initialize Counters**:
    - Set a counter `step` to 1.
    - Set another counter `index` to 0.

4. **Process Values**:
    - Create a loop that runs as long as `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
        - If the value at `booleanList[index]` is True:
            - Set `booleanList[index]` to False.
        - Increment `step` by 1.
        - Update `index` to be the next position calculated as (current `index` + `step`) modulo `n`.

5. **Check for Remaining True Values**:
    - Create a new list named `remainingTrue` that includes only the True values from `booleanList`.

6. **Output Result**:
    - If `remainingTrue` is empty (meaning all values have been set to False):
        - Print 'YES'
    - Otherwise:
        - Print 'NO'

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The `step` counter changes how many positions we skip in the `booleanList` each time we mark an entry as False.
- The use of modulo ensures we wrap around the list when the index exceeds the size of the list `n`.
- By checking for remaining True values at the end, we confirm if the marking process was complete.
