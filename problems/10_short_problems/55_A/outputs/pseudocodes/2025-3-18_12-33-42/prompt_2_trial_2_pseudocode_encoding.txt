1. Begin by accepting an integer input that specifies the size of a list.
2. Create a list of boolean values, initializing each value to True. The length of this list should be equal to the integer input.
3. Initialize two variables: one for an index to iterate through the list (starting at 1) and another to track the current position in the boolean list.
4. Enter a loop that continues as long as the index is less than or equal to 500,000.
   - Inside the loop, check if the current position in the boolean list has a True value.
     - If it does, change that value to False.
   - Increment the index by 1.
   - Update the current position using the formula: move forward in the list by the current index value and use modulo to wrap around if necessary.
5. After exiting the loop, create a new list by filtering the boolean list to include only the True values.
6. Check the length of this filtered list:
   - If the length is zero, output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO". 

This pseudocode captures the essence of the original logic, outlining the key steps and decisions without relying on specific programming syntax.
