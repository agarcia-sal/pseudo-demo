Here is a clear and concise pseudocode representation of the provided code, following the structured language concepts:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Input the number of elements
    SET n TO USER_INPUT() // Assumes n is a non-negative integer
    
    // Step 2: Create a boolean list initialized to True
    INITIALIZE booleanList AS ARRAY OF TRUE WITH SIZE n
    
    // Step 3: Initialize counter variables
    SET index TO 0
    SET step TO 1

    // Step 4: Process the boolean list
    WHILE step <= 500000 DO
        IF booleanList[index] IS TRUE THEN
            SET booleanList[index] TO FALSE
        ENDIF
        
        // Update step and index for the next iteration
        INCREMENT step BY 1
        SET index TO (index + step) MOD n // Update index, wrap around if needed
    ENDWHILE

    // Step 5: Check for remaining TRUE values in the list
    INITIALIZE remainingTrue AS ARRAY OF booleanList WHERE value IS TRUE
    
    // Step 6: Output the result based on the length of remainingTrue
    IF LENGTH(remainingTrue) IS 0 THEN
        OUTPUT 'YES'
    ELSE
        OUTPUT 'NO'
    ENDIF

END
```

### Breakdown of Steps:
1. **Input Handling**: The pseudocode begins by indicating user input for the variable `n`, representing the number of elements.
2. **List Initialization**: A boolean list initialized to `True` is created, representing states that can change to `False`.
3. **Loop Structure**: The main processing is done in a while loop that continues until a specified step limit is reached.
4. **Conditionals**: Decision-making occurs to set elements of the boolean list to `False` based on the current index.
5. **Final Check**: After processing the list, a check is performed to determine if any `True` values remain, outputting results accordingly.

### Assumptions:
- The input `n` is a valid, non-negative integer.
- The output is in text format, capable of displaying 'YES' or 'NO'.
- The boolean array is treated as a zero-based index.
