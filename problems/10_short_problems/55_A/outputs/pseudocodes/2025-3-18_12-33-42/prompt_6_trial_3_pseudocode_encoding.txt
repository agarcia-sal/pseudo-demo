Below is the pseudocode that captures the logic of the provided code in a clear and understandable format:

```
START

// Step 1: Read an integer input representing the size of the array
SET size as input() // size will be a positive integer

// Step 2: Initialize a boolean array of the specified size where all elements are initially True
CREATE boolean array isActive of length size and set all elements to True

// Step 3: Initialize tracking variables
SET index to 0
SET counter to 1

// Step 4: Use a loop to iterate while counter is less than or equal to 500,000
WHILE counter is less than or equal to 500000 DO
    // Step 4a: If the current position in the isActive array is True
    IF isActive[index] is True THEN
        // Step 4b: Mark the current position as False
        SET isActive[index] to False
    END IF

    // Step 4c: Increment the counter for the next step
    INCREMENT counter by 1

    // Step 4d: Calculate the next index using the formula (index + counter) modulo size
    SET index to (index + counter) MOD size
END WHILE

// Step 5: Filter the isActive array to get a new list of True values
CREATE a new list activeElements that contains all True elements from isActive

// Step 6: Check if there are any True values in the activeElements list
IF LENGTH of activeElements is 0 THEN
    PRINT 'YES' // Indicating no active elements are found
ELSE
    PRINT 'NO' // Indicating at least one active element is found
END IF

END
```

### Explanation:
- This pseudocode breaks down the original code into clear steps, using descriptive variable and function names to enhance understanding.
- It summarizes the looping and conditional logic without getting into the specifics of syntax.
- The comments provide clarity about each step's purpose and increases the overall readability of the code. 
- The input and output are clearly stated to reflect the intent of the original code.
