**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
2. **Read an integer value `n` from input**
3. **Create a list `isMarked` of size `n` and initialize all values to `True`**
4. **Set variables `position` to 0 and `step` to 1**
5. **While `step` is less than or equal to 500,000, do the following:**
   1. **If the value at the current `position` in `isMarked` is `True`:**
      - **Set the value at `position` in `isMarked` to `False`**
   2. **Increment `step` by 1**
   3. **Update `position` to be the remainder when (`position` + `step`) is divided by `n`**
6. **Create a list `unmarked` containing all `True` values from `isMarked`**
7. **If the length of `unmarked` is 0:**
   - **Output 'YES'**
8. **Else:**
   - **Output 'NO'**
9. **End** 

**Summary:**
The algorithm starts by initializing a list to track marked positions, then marks positions based on a calculated step value in a loop. Finally, it checks if any positions remain unmarked and outputs a result based on that check.
