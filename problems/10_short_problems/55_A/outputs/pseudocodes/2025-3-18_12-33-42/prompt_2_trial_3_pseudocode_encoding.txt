**Pseudocode Translation**

1. **Input:** Read an integer value representing the size of the list, referred to as `listSize`.
2. **Initialize:** Create a list named `booleanList` consisting of `listSize` elements, all set to true. This list will be used to track boolean states.
3. **Set Initial Values:** Define two variables: `index` set to 0 and `currentValue` set to 1.
4. **Loop Until Limit:** Continue looping while `currentValue` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the element at `index` in `booleanList` is true:
     - If it is true, change that element to false.
   - Increase `currentValue` by 1.
   - Update `index` by adding `currentValue` to it and then taking the remainder when divided by `listSize` (this keeps `index` within the bounds of the list).
5. **Extract True Values:** Generate a list called `trueValues` containing all elements from `booleanList` that are still true.
6. **Check Result:**
   - If the number of true elements in `trueValues` is zero:
     - Output the message 'YES'.
   - Otherwise:
     - Output the message 'NO'. 

This pseudocode summarizes the logic of identifying remaining true values in a boolean list after modifying it through a systematic elimination process based on the specified conditions.
