Here is the pseudocode translated from the provided code, following your guidelines:

```
START

// Step 1: Input and Setup
SET n AS INTEGER
PROMPT user for input n
INITIALIZE b AS ARRAY of BOOLEAN of size n (all elements are TRUE)
SET j TO 0
SET i TO 1

// Step 2: Iterate while i is less than or equal to 500000
WHILE (i <= 500000) DO
    // Step 3: Check the value of b at index j
    IF (b[j] IS TRUE) THEN
        SET b[j] TO FALSE // Mark this index as false
    END IF

    // Step 4: Update indices
    INCREMENT i BY 1
    SET j TO (j + i) MOD n // Wrap around using modulus operator
END WHILE

// Step 5: Filter TRUE values from array b
SET x AS ARRAY of BOOLEAN containing elements of b that ARE TRUE

// Step 6: Check if array x is empty
IF LENGTH(x) EQUALS 0 THEN
    PRINT 'YES' // No TRUE values found
ELSE
    PRINT 'NO' // There are TRUE values found
END IF

END
```

### Assumptions:
1. The variable `n` is assumed to be a non-negative integer input.
2. The array `b` is initialized with all `TRUE` values indicating a initial state.
3. The logic primarily revolves around marking certain indices of the array as `FALSE`, based on the loop's index calculations. 

This pseudocode uses clear and concise statements to represent actions and structures from the original code, making it easy to read and understand while maintaining the intended logic.
