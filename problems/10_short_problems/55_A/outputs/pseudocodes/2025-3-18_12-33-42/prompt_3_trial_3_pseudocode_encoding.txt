// Start of the pseudocode

// Accept an integer input representing the size of the list
SET sizeOfList TO integer input

// Create a list to track flags, initialized to True for all elements
INITIALIZE flagsList AS a list of boolean values, with all elements set to True, of length sizeOfList

// Initialize two tracking variables
SET stepCounter TO 1
SET indexCounter TO 0

// Loop through numbers from 1 to 500,000
WHILE stepCounter is less than or equal to 500000 DO
    // If the current index in flagsList is True
    IF flagsList[indexCounter] is True THEN
        // Set the current index to False
        SET flagsList[indexCounter] to False

    // Move to the next step
    INCREMENT stepCounter by 1
    
    // Update the indexCounter, wrapping around if it exceeds sizeOfList
    SET indexCounter TO (indexCounter + stepCounter) MOD sizeOfList
ENDWHILE

// Create a new list of values from flagsList that are still True
INITIALIZE remainingTrueFlags AS a list containing elements from flagsList that are True

// Check if there are any True values left in remainingTrueFlags

### Explanation of Pseudocode
This pseudocode captures the logic of the original code by outlining the steps and structures used in a straightforward way. It defines input expectations, describes the handling of a list of boolean flags, and details the looping and condition-checking processes without relying on programming language syntax. The variable names are chosen to convey their purpose clearly, making it accessible for someone unfamiliar with the original code.
