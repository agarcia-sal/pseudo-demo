### Purpose
The goal of this algorithm is to determine whether all elements in a list can be marked as false based on a specific iteration and marking process.

### Pseudocode

1. **Start Program**
   
2. **Get Input**
   - Read an integer value, **total_count**, from the user. This represents the size of a list.

3. **Initialize List**
   - Create a list called **status_list** with **total_count** elements, all set to true (indicating that they are initially unmarked).

4. **Set Starting Values**
   - Initialize a variable **current_index** to 0 (this will keep track of which element is being processed).
   - Initialize a variable **counter** to 1 (this will determine how far to jump in the list).

5. **Process the List**
   - While **counter** is less than or equal to 500,000:
     a. If the element at **current_index** in **status_list** is true:
        - Set the element at **current_index** in **status_list** to false (mark it).
     b. Increment **counter** by 1.
     c. Update **current_index** to the new position using the formula:
        - **current_index** = (**current_index** + **counter**) modulo **total_count**.
     
6. **Check Results**
   - Create a new list called **unmarked_elements** that contains only the elements in **status_list** that remain true.
   
7. **Output Result**
   - If the length of **unmarked_elements** is equal to 0:
     - Print "YES" (indicating all elements were marked).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating some elements remain unmarked).

8. **End Program**

### Summary
This pseudocode effectively represents the logic of the original code, detailing how the list is marked as elements are processed and then checking if all elements were marked at the end.
