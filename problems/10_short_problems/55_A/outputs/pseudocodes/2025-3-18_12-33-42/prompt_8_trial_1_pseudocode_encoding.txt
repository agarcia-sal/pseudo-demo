**Purpose Summary:**  
The goal of the code is to determine whether, after a series of operations, all values in a list are marked as `True` or not. The program begins with a list of `True` values and modifies this list based on specific iterations and conditions. The final output indicates whether any `True` values remain.

**Pseudocode:**

```
1. Initialize the variable 'size' by reading an integer input.
2. Create a list called 'booleanList' of length 'size', filled with 'True' values.
3. Set the variable 'currentIndex' to 0.
4. Set the variable 'step' to 1.

5. While 'step' is less than or equal to 500000 do the following:
    a. If the value at 'currentIndex' in 'booleanList' is 'True', then:
        i. Mark the value at 'currentIndex' in 'booleanList' as 'False'.
    b. Increment 'step' by 1.
    c. Update 'currentIndex' to be the new position calculated as (currentIndex + step) modulo 'size'.

6. Create a new list called 'remainingTrue' to hold any values from 'booleanList' that are still 'True'.

7. If the length of 'remainingTrue' is 0, then:
    a. Print "YES" indicating no 'True' values remain.
8. Otherwise:
    a. Print "NO" indicating some 'True' values still exist.
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The initial list `booleanList` represents a set of values that are all considered "active" (True).
- As the program executes, it marks certain positions in this list as "inactive" (False) based on a step size that increases on each iteration.
- The final check reveals whether any active values are left in the list, and prints the appropriate message based on that check. 

This clear step-by-step breakdown makes it accessible to readers who may not be familiar with the specific details of the original code.
