### Purpose
This code determines whether a configuration of boolean flags can achieve a certain end state based on a specific algorithm.

### Pseudocode

```
# Step 1: Accept an integer input which defines the size of the boolean list
Read integer n

# Step 2: Initialize a boolean list with 'True' values to represent the flags
Create a list of boolean flags `isActive` with size n, all set to True

# Step 3: Initialize variables for tracking current index and iteration count
Set currentIndex to 0
Set iterationCount to 1

# Step 4: Perform a loop to process flags based on the specified conditions
While iterationCount is less than or equal to 500000:
    # Step 4.1: Check if the flag at the current index is active
    If isActive[currentIndex] is True:
        # Step 4.2: Deactivate the current flag
        Set isActive[currentIndex] to False

    # Step 4.3: Move to the next index based on the current iteration count
    Increment iterationCount by 1
    Update currentIndex to (currentIndex + iterationCount) modulo n

# Step 5: Create a new list of active flags
Create a new list `activeFlags` containing only the flags that are still True from isActive

# Step 6: Check if there are any active flags left
If the length of activeFlags is 0:
    # If no flags are active, print "YES"
    Print "YES"
Else:
    # If there are still active flags, print "NO"
    Print "NO"
```

### Comments for Clarity
- `n` represents the number of boolean flags we're working with.
- `isActive` acts as an array where initially all flags are set to active (True).
- The loop runs a maximum of 500,000 times, updating the index based on the current iteration.
- The program ultimately checks if any flags remain active to determine the outcome.

### Example Structures
- Clear naming (e.g., `isActive`, `currentIndex`, `iterationCount`) helps communicate the program's functionality.
- Logical grouping of steps enhances readability and comprehension.
- Simple condition checks and outputs make it easy to follow the flow of the program. 

### Review for Clarity
The pseudocode effectively communicates the functional flow of the original code, breaking complex operations into simple steps and ensuring a clear understanding for readers of various skill levels.
