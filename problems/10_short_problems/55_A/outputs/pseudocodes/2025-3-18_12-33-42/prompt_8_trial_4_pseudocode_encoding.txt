**Purpose Summary**: The goal of this program is to determine whether there exists at least one element in a list that remains marked as "True" after a series of operations. Specifically, the program simulates a process that marks elements in a cyclic manner until a certain limit is reached.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start Program**: 
   - Read a single integer input `n` which represents the number of elements.

2. **Initialize List**:
   - Create a list `isMarked` with `n` elements, all initially set to `True`. This list will track whether each element is marked.

3. **Set Initial Variables**:
   - Initialize a variable `currentIndex` to `0` (this represents the current position in the list).
   - Initialize a variable `step` to `1` (this will control how far we jump in the list).

4. **Mark Elements**: 
   - Continue a loop while `step` is less than or equal to `500000`:
     - If the current element at position `currentIndex` in `isMarked` is `True`, mark it as `False`.
     - Increment `step` by `1`.
     - Update `currentIndex` to move to the next position: 
       - Calculate the new position by adding `step` to `currentIndex`, then take that sum modulo `n` to ensure it wraps around if it goes past the end of the list.

5. **Check Remaining True Elements**: 
   - Create a new list `remainingTrue` that contains all elements from `isMarked` that are still `True`.

6. **Output Result**:
   - If the length of `remainingTrue` is `0` (indicating no elements are marked as `True`), print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The process simulates a marking system where we "jump" ahead by increasing steps on each iteration, effectively marking positions in a circular manner.
- The final check essentially determines if any positions remain unmarked (True), which would affect the final output indicating a complete marking. 

This pseudocode represents a clear logical flow from input to output while breaking down operations for better understanding.
