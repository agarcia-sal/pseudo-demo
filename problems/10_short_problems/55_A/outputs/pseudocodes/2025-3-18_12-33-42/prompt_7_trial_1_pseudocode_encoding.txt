### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Purpose:** The function `checkCondition` checks a condition based on a boolean list initialized with size `n`, processes it through a loop up to 500,000 increments, and finally determines if any `True` values remain.
- **Variables:** `booleanList` holds boolean values, `index` keeps track of the current position to modify, and `increment` denotes the number that determines how the index updates.
- **Logic Flow:** After populating `booleanList`, it processes it using a while loop that alters values based on the current index and increment. Finally, it checks if any `True` values are left in the list and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
