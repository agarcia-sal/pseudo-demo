**Purpose**: The program determines whether, after processing a list of boolean values based on a specific logic involving indices, any `True` values remain in the list. It outputs "YES" if no `True` values are left and "NO" otherwise.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Get a number *n* from user input, which represents the number of boolean values.
   - Create a list *b* of size *n*, with all values initially set to `True`.
   - Set index variable *j* to 0.
   - Set counter variable *i* to 1.

2. **Loop Through Indices**:
   - Start a loop that continues while *i* is less than or equal to 500,000.
     - If the value at index *j* in list *b* is `True`:
       - Set that value at index *j* to `False`.
     - Increment the counter *i* by 1.
     - Update the index *j* to the next position using the formula: 
       - *j* = (*j* + *i*) modulo *n* (this wraps around if *j* exceeds the length of *b*).

3. **Check Remaining True Values**:
   - Create a new list *x* that contains all values from *b* that are still `True`.

4. **Output Result**:
   - If the length of list *x* is equal to 0 (meaning no `True` values are left):
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

**Comments**:
- This program uses a boolean array to represent a state that gets modified based on the computed indices. 
- The key operation is flipping the values from `True` to `False` based on a continuously increasing index, which checks the current index against the size of the list to stay within bounds. 
- After processing, it checks if any `True` values remain, determining the final output accordingly.
