Here's the pseudocode based on the provided code snippet, focusing on clarity and intent:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read an integer input representing the size of the array
    SET sizeOfArray TO INTEGER(INPUT)

    // Step 2: Initialize a boolean array to track status (all elements start as True)
    SET booleanArray TO ARRAY OF TRUE with size sizeOfArray

    // Step 3: Initialize variables for control
    SET indexIncrement TO 1
    SET currentIndex TO 0

    // Step 4: Loop until indexIncrement exceeds 500000
    WHILE indexIncrement <= 500000 DO
        
        // Step 5: If current index in booleanArray is marked as True
        IF booleanArray[currentIndex] IS TRUE THEN
            
            // Step 6: Mark current index as False
            SET booleanArray[currentIndex] TO FALSE
        
        // Step 7: Prepare for the next iteration
        INCREMENT indexIncrement BY 1
        
        // Step 8: Update the currentIndex based on the new indexIncrement
        SET currentIndex TO (currentIndex + indexIncrement) MOD sizeOfArray

    END WHILE

    // Step 9: Filter the booleanArray to find all True values
    SET trueValuesList TO LIST OF elements in booleanArray WHERE element IS TRUE

    // Step 10: Check if there are any remaining True values
    IF LENGTH(trueValuesList) IS 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'  // Indicating there are no True values left
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'   // Indicating there are still True values remaining
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:
1. **Input Reading**: The pseudocode begins by reading an integer input that determines the number of elements in the boolean array.
2. **Boolean Array Initialization**: A boolean array is initialized, with all values set to true to signify that they are "active."
3. **Index Management**: Two variables are maintained: one for the current index increment and another for the current position in the array.
4. **Main Logic Loop**: A loop runs while the index increment is less than or equal to 500,000. Inside this loop, if the current index's value in the boolean array is true, it gets set to false.
5. **Index Update**: After updating the boolean array, both the index increment and the current index are adjusted for the next loop iteration.
6. **Final Check**: After exiting the loop, the pseudocode checks how many true values remain and prints "YES" if none are left, otherwise "NO." 

This structured approach provides a clear understanding of the algorithm's steps without relying on specific programming language syntax.
