Here is the pseudocode based on the provided code snippet:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read the input
    INPUT numberOfElements

    // Step 2: Initialize a boolean list with size numberOfElements
    CREATE booleanList WITH size numberOfElements, ALL VALUES set to TRUE

    // Step 3: Initialize parameters for indexing and iteration
    SET index to 0
    SET increment to 1

    // Step 4: Iterate until increment is less than or equal to 500000
    WHILE (increment <= 500000) DO
        
        // Step 5: Check the value at the current index in the boolean list
        IF (booleanList[index] IS TRUE) THEN
            SET booleanList[index] to FALSE  // Mark this index as processed
        END IF

        // Step 6: Update increment value and calculate the new index
        INCREMENT increment by 1
        SET index to (index + increment) MOD numberOfElements  // Wrap around using modulo
    END WHILE

    // Step 7: Filter the boolean list to find all TRUE values
    CREATE filteredList with elements from booleanList WHERE value IS TRUE

    // Step 8: Check the length of the filtered list
    IF (length of filteredList IS 0) THEN
        OUTPUT "YES"  // No TRUE values found
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "NO"   // There are TRUE values found
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Input Handling:** It begins by reading the number of elements.
2. **Initialization:** A boolean list is initialized to track which indices are processed.
3. **Iteration Logic:** A loop runs while incrementing a counter until a certain limit is reached, modifying the boolean list accordingly.
4. **Filtering:** After processing, the boolean list is filtered to determine if there are any TRUE values left.
5. **Output Decision:** Finally, a check is made to see if there are any TRUE values, and an appropriate message is printed. 

The structure maintains clarity in the flow of logic and emphasizes the intent behind each operation without the complexity of specific programming syntax.
