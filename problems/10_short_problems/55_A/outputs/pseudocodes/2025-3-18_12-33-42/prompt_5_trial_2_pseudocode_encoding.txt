**Purpose:**
The code checks a condition based on a list of boolean values and determines the output as either "YES" or "NO" based on whether any values in that list remain true after a series of operations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Get the number of boolean values to process
    SET numberOfValues to read an integer from input

    // Step 2: Create a list of boolean values, all initially set to true
    CREATE a list named booleanList with size 'numberOfValues', all values set to TRUE

    // Step 3: Initialize variables for the iteration
    SET indexIncrement to 1
    SET currentIndex to 0

    // Step 4: Iterate while indexIncrement is less than or equal to 500000
    WHILE indexIncrement <= 500000 DO
        
        // Step 5: Check if the boolean value at currentIndex is still TRUE
        IF booleanList[currentIndex] is TRUE THEN
            // Step 6: Set the current value to FALSE
            SET booleanList[currentIndex] to FALSE
        END IF

        // Update indexIncrement for the next iteration
        INCREMENT indexIncrement by 1
        
        // Step 7: Calculate the next index by wrapping around the list length
        SET currentIndex to (currentIndex + indexIncrement) MOD numberOfValues
    END WHILE

    // Step 8: Filter the list to find any remaining TRUE values
    CREATE a list named remainingTrueValues with values from booleanList where the value is TRUE

    // Step 9: Check if there are any values remaining that are still TRUE
    IF length of remainingTrueValues is 0 THEN
        // Step 10: If no TRUE values found, print "YES"
        OUTPUT "YES"
    ELSE
        // Step 11: If any TRUE values found, print "NO"
        OUTPUT "NO"
    END IF

END
```

**Comments:**
1. **Input Handling:** The program starts by accepting an integer input that determines the size of the boolean list.
2. **Boolean List Initialization:** Initially, all values are set to TRUE, indicating they are "active."
3. **Index Management:** The program uses two counters; one to determine how many times to loop, and another to manage positions within the boolean list.
4. **List Filtering:** After processing, it checks which values are still TRUE and bases the final output on that.
5. **Output Determination:** "YES" means no active (TRUE) values remain, while "NO" indicates at least one value is still active.
