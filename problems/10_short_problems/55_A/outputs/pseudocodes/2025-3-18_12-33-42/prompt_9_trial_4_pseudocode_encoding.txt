**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to determine whether there are any `True` values remaining in a list after a specific process of marking elements as `False`.

**Pseudocode:**  

1. **Input the Size:**  
   Read an integer value representing the size of the list (`n`).

2. **Initialize the List:**  
   Create a list called `status` with a length of `n`, initializing all elements to `True`.

3. **Set Initial Indices:**  
   Set two variables, `currentIndex` to 0 and `step` to 1.

4. **Loop Until a Limit is Reached:**  
   While the value of `step` is less than or equal to 500000:
   - If the element at `currentIndex` in the `status` list is `True`:
     - Change the value at `currentIndex` to `False`.
   - Increment the value of `step` by 1.
   - Update `currentIndex` to the next position, calculated as `(currentIndex + step) mod n`.

5. **Check Remaining Values:**  
   Create a new list called `remainingTrueValues` containing elements from `status` that are still `True`.

6. **Determine and Output Result:**  
   If the length of `remainingTrueValues` is equal to 0, then print "YES".  
   Otherwise, print "NO".  

This pseudocode succinctly captures the logic and flow of the original code while maintaining clarity and accessibility for readers of varying backgrounds. The steps have been broken down into straightforward actions to facilitate understanding of each operation performed.
