**Pseudocode: Check for Availability in a Circular List**

1. **Input**: Read an integer `n`, which represents the size of a circular list.
  
2. **Initialize**: 
   - Create a list `isAvailable` of size `n`, filled with the value `True`. This list will track whether each index is available.

3. **Set Up Control Variables**:
   - Initialize an index variable `index` to 0.
   - Initialize a step variable `step` to 1.

4. **Loop**: While the value of `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the current position in `isAvailable` (at `index`) is `True`.
     - If it is `True`, set `isAvailable[index]` to `False`, indicating that this position is no longer available.
   - Increment `step` by 1.
   - Update `index` using the formula `index = (index + step) % n` to ensure it wraps around the list.

5. **Check for Availability**:
   - Create a new list `availablePositions` containing all positions from `isAvailable` that are still marked as `True`.

6. **Output**:
   - If the length of `availablePositions` is 0, print "YES". This indicates that all positions have been marked as not available.
   - Otherwise, print "NO", indicating that at least one position is still available.
