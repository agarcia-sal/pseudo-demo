BEGIN

// Step 1: Read an integer input that represents the size of an array
SET size_of_array TO integer input

// Step 2: Create a boolean array initialized to True, indicating all positions are available
CREATE boolean_array OF size size_of_array WITH ALL VALUES SET TO True

// Step 3: Initialize variables for loop control
SET j TO 0 // This will track the current position in the boolean array
SET i TO 1 // This will be used to determine the step size

### Overview of Logic
1. The algorithm initializes a boolean array to track positions, with all initially set to true.
2. It marks positions as false based on a defined stepping behavior while iterating up to 500,000.
3. After processing, it checks for any remaining true values in the array.
4. The final output indicates whether all positions were successfully marked false.
