Here's the translation of the provided code into clear and concise pseudocode:

```
DECLARE n AS INTEGER
READ n FROM USER INPUT

INITIALIZE b AS A LIST OF TRUE WITH SIZE n
SET j TO 0
SET i TO 1

WHILE (i LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 500000) DO
    IF b[j] IS TRUE THEN
        SET b[j] TO FALSE
    END IF
    
    INCREMENT i BY 1
    SET j TO (j + i) MOD n
END WHILE

INITIALIZE x AS A LIST CONTAINING ALL VALUES FROM b THAT ARE TRUE

IF LENGTH OF x IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
    PRINT 'YES'
ELSE
    PRINT 'NO'
END IF
```

### Breakdown of the Components:
1. **Variable Declaration and Input:**
   - n: Integer input representing the size of the list `b`.
   - b: A list initialized to contain all `True` values of size `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - j and i are initialized to control the loop and indexing.
  
3. **Loop Structure:**
   - A `WHILE` loop that continues until `i` exceeds `500,000`.
   - Inside the loop, a condition checks if the current index in `b` (indexed by j) is `True` and sets it to `False`, changing its state.

4. **Index Manipulation:**
   - The index `j` is updated using the modulus operator to ensure it wraps around within the bounds of `b`.

5. **Filtering and Result Evaluation:**
   - A list `x` is created by filtering `b` for values that remain `True`.
   - A conditional check determines if `x` is empty, indicating the final output.

### Assumptions:
- The variable `n` is a positive integer.
- The list `b` can accommodate operations based on the index derived from values of `j`.
- The operations expect valid behavior of list indexing and modulus calculations within the bounds of `n`.
