**Purpose:** The goal of the algorithm is to determine if there are any remaining "True" values in a list after performing a series of operations, based on a specified number of iterations.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Get an integer value `n` from user input, representing the size of a list.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a list `is_active` of size `n` filled with `True` values. This list represents elements that are still active.
   - Set a variable `current_index` to 0, which will track the position in the list.
   - Set a variable `step_count` to 1, which will determine the step size in each iteration.

3. **Perform Operations:**
   - While `step_count` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - Check if the current position in `is_active` is `True`:
       - If it is `True`, mark the current position as `False` (indicating it is no longer active).
     - Increment `step_count` by 1.
     - Update `current_index` to be the new position in the list, calculated by adding `step_count` to `current_index` and then using modulo `n` to ensure it wraps around if it goes beyond the list size.

4. **Check Active Elements:**
   - Create a new list `active_elements` containing all elements from `is_active` that are still `True`.

5. **Determine Output:**
   - If `active_elements` is empty (i.e., no active elements remain):
     - Print "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO"

**Final Review:**
- The pseudocode captures the logic of the original code accurately, maintaining the structure and identifiable components while simplifying the operations and terms for clarity.
