**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input:** Read an integer value representing 'n' from the user.
   
2. **Initialize List:** Create a list 'isPrimeCandidate' with 'n' elements, all set to 'True'. This list represents whether each index is a prime candidate initially.

3. **Set Starting Index and Increment:** 
   - Initialize a variable 'currentIndex' to 0, which will keep track of our position in the list.
   - Initialize a variable 'incrementValue' to 1, which will control how we move through the list.

4. **Outer Loop for Operations:** 
   - While 'incrementValue' is less than or equal to 500000, do the following:
     1. Check if the value at 'isPrimeCandidate[currentIndex]' is still 'True'.
     2. If it is 'True', set 'isPrimeCandidate[currentIndex]' to 'False'.
     3. Increase 'incrementValue' by 1.
     4. Update 'currentIndex' by moving forward in a circular manner using the formula: (currentIndex + incrementValue) mod n.

5. **Identify Remaining True Values:**
   - Create a new list 'remainingTrueValues' that includes all indices from 'isPrimeCandidate' that are still 'True'.

6. **Output Check:**
   - If 'remainingTrueValues' is empty (meaning there are no 'True' values left):
     - Output 'YES'.
   - Otherwise:
     - Output 'NO'. 

**Summary:** This pseudocode reflects the algorithm's intent to manipulate a list based on conditions set forth, ultimately determining if there are any remaining prime candidates based on the operations performed under specified constraints.
