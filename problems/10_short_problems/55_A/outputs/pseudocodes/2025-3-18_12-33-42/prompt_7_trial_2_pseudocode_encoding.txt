Here is the pseudocode that captures the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION checkNumbers(n)
    // Initialize an array to track boolean flags
    INITIALIZE booleanArray as an array of size n with all elements set to True
    INITIALIZE index as 0
    INITIALIZE step as 1

    // Iterate while step is less than or equal to 500000
    WHILE step <= 500000 DO
        // If the current index is marked True, set it to False
        IF booleanArray[index] IS True THEN
            booleanArray[index] = False
        END IF
        
        // Increment step
        step = step + 1
        
        // Update the index to point to the next position in the array in a circular manner
        index = (index + step) MOD n
    END WHILE

    // Create a new list with only elements that remain True
    INITIALIZE remainingTrue as a list of elements from booleanArray where the value is True

    // Check if there are no remaining True values
    IF LENGTH(remainingTrue) == 0 THEN
        PRINT "YES"
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"
    END IF
END FUNCTION

// Input: Read an integer value n
n = READ integer input from user
CALL checkNumbers(n)
```

### Explanation of Logic:
1. **Input Handling:** The function `checkNumbers` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the size of the boolean array.
2. **Boolean Array Initialization:** It creates an array of booleans initialized to `True`, signifying available positions.
3. **Circular Indexing and Modification:** It iterates over a range defined by `step` (up to 500,000), modifying the boolean array based on a circular index calculation.
4. **Final Condition Check:** The function creates a new list containing only the `True` values from the original array and checks if this list is empty.
5. **Output:** It prints "YES" if there are no `True` values left; otherwise, it prints "NO". 

The pseudocode maintains high-level abstraction and focuses on clarity and readability, making it understandable for readers of various programming backgrounds.
