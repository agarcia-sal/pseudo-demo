**Pseudocode:**

1. Begin the program
2. Read an integer value from user input and store it as `n`
3. Initialize a list `b` with `n` elements, all set to `True` (indicating all elements are initially "active")
4. Set `j` to 0 (This will be used to track the current index in the list)
5. Set `i` to 1 (This will be used to incrementally advance through the process)

6. While `i` is less than or equal to 500,000 do the following:
   - If the element at index `j` in the list `b` is `True`, set it to `False` (indicating it has been "deactivated")
   - Increment `i` by 1
   - Update `j` to the new value calculated as `(j + i) modulo n` (this keeps `j` within the bounds of the list)

7. Create a new list `x` containing all elements from `b` that are still `True` (active elements)

8. If the length of list `x` is 0 (meaning there are no active elements):
   - Output "YES"
9. Otherwise:
   - Output "NO"

10. End the program.
