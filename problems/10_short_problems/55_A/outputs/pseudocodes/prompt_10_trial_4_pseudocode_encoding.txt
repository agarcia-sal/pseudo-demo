Here is the pseudocode based on the given Python code:

```
BEGIN

    // Assume n is a positive integer input by the user
    INPUT n as INTEGER
    
    // Initialize a list b with True values for each index from 0 to n-1
    INITIALIZE b as LIST of BOOLEAN with size n, all SET to True
    
    // Initialize counters
    SET j to 0
    SET i to 1

    // Loop while i is less than or equal to 500000
    WHILE (i <= 500000) DO
        // If the current index j in list b is True
        IF (b[j] is True) THEN
            // Set the current index j in list b to False
            SET b[j] to False
        END IF
        
        // Increment i by 1
        INCREMENT i by 1
        
        // Update j to the new index using modulo to keep it within bounds of n
        SET j to (j + i) MOD n
    END WHILE
    
    // Create a new list x containing all elements in b that are still True
    INITIALIZE x as LIST with elements from b where value is True

    // Check the length of list x
    IF (length of x is 0) THEN
        PRINT 'YES' // No True values remain in b
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'  // Some True values remain in b
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins with taking input for `n`, which is assumed to be a positive integer.
2. **Initialization:** A list `b` is created with all elements set to `True`, and two counters `j` and `i` are initialized.
3. **Loop Structure:** A while loop iterates while `i` is less than or equal to 500,000, indicating that a certain number of operations will be performed.
4. **Conditionals:** Inside the loop, a conditional checks if the current position in the list `b` is still `True`, then updates it accordingly.
5. **Updating Indices:** The index `j` is updated in a manner that wraps around using modulo to keep it within the bounds of the list size.
6. **Final Check:** After the loop, another conditional checks if the filtered list `x` (containing only `True` values from `b`) is empty or not, and prints the appropriate message.

This pseudocode maintains clarity and follows a structured format to express the logic clearly.
