**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the program.**
   
2. **Input the total number of elements:**  
   - Read an integer value and store it as `totalElements`.

3. **Initialize a list of boolean values:**  
   - Create a list called `isActive` with length equal to `totalElements`, 
   - Fill this list with `True` to indicate that all elements are initially considered active.

4. **Set up counters:**  
   - Initialize a variable `currentIndex` to 0, which will keep track of the position in the `isActive` list.  
   - Initialize a variable `step` to 1, which will define how much to move forward in each iteration.

5. **Loop for a maximum of 500,000 iterations:**  
   - While `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - Check if the current position in the `isActive` list (at `currentIndex`) is still marked as `True`.
       - If it is `True`, change it to `False` (indicating that this position is now inactive).
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update `currentIndex` by adding `step` and taking the result modulo `totalElements` to ensure it wraps around if it exceeds the length of the list.

6. **Collect remaining active elements:**  
   - Create a new list called `remainingActive` that includes all positions in `isActive` which are still `True`.

7. **Check the result:**  
   - If the length of `remainingActive` is 0 (meaning there are no active elements left):  
     - Output "YES" (indicating that all elements are inactive).
   - Otherwise:  
     - Output "NO" (indicating that some elements remain active).

8. **End the program.**
