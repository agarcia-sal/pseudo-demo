**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Input**: Read an integer value called `totalNumbers`.

3. **Initialize**: Create a list called `isNumberAvailable` with size equal to `totalNumbers`, and set all values to `True`. This list will be used to track the availability of each number.

4. **Initialize**: Set a variable `stepCount` to 1 to track the current step in the elimination process. 

5. **Initialize**: Set a variable `currentIndex` to 0 to indicate the current position in the `isNumberAvailable` list.

6. **Loop**: Repeat while `stepCount` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the value at the `currentIndex` in the `isNumberAvailable` list is `True`:
     - If it is, set that position in the list to `False`.
   - Increment `stepCount` by 1.
   - Update `currentIndex` to be the new current position using the formula `(currentIndex + stepCount) modulo totalNumbers`.

7. **Create a new list**: Generate a list called `availableNumbers` containing all elements from `isNumberAvailable` that remain `True` (indicating those numbers are still available).

8. **Check availability**:
   - If the length of `availableNumbers` is equal to 0:
     - Output “YES” (indicating all numbers have been eliminated).
   - Otherwise:
     - Output “NO” (indicating there are still available numbers).

9. **End**
