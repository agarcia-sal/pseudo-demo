Here is the pseudocode to convey the logic of the provided code snippet clearly and effectively:

```
BEGIN
    // Read an integer input representing the size of the list
    SET listSize = Read integer from input

    // Create a boolean list initialized to True
    INITIALIZE booleanList as a list of True with size listSize

    SET index = 0  // Start index for the boolean list
    SET currentNumber = 1  // Starting point for the iterative process

    // Loop until currentNumber reaches 500000
    WHILE currentNumber <= 500000 DO
        // If the current index in the boolean list is True
        IF booleanList[index] THEN
            // Mark this index as False
            SET booleanList[index] = False
        
        // Move to the next number
        INCREMENT currentNumber by 1

        // Update the index using the formula (index + currentNumber) modulo listSize
        SET index = (index + currentNumber) MOD listSize
    END WHILE

    // Create a new list to collect all True values from the boolean list
    SET trueValuesList as a list of all elements from booleanList where value is True

    // Check if the list of True values is empty
    IF LENGTH(trueValuesList) == 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'  // Output YES if no True values are found
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'   // Output NO if there are still True values found
    END IF
END
```

### Explanation:
- **Purpose:** The pseudocode captures the flow of creating a boolean list and iteratively modifying it based on a given condition.
- **Control Structures:** Clear iteration and condition checks are represented to show the logic without using specific programming syntax.
- **Input/Output:** The input is treated as reading an integer that determines the size of the list. The output clearly indicates "YES" or "NO" based on the results derived from the boolean list.
- **Clarity:** Each operation and condition are broken down methodically to enhance understanding for someone unfamiliar with the original code.
