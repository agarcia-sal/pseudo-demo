**Explanation of Pseudocode:**
- The pseudocode begins with capturing an input that determines the size of a list (`totalNumbers`).
- An array (`isPrimeArray`) is initialized to keep track of whether certain indices are still considered "prime" or not.
- Two variables (`positionIncrement` and `currentIndex`) control the index updates.
- The main logic involves a while loop that runs up to 500000 iterations, marking certain indices as False in a circular manner.
- After the loop, we extract all indices in `isPrimeArray` still marked as True and check if any remain, printing "YES" or "NO" as appropriate.
