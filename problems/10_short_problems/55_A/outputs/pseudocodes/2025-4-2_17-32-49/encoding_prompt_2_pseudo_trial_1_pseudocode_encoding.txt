**Pseudocode:**

1. Start by receiving an input value that represents the number of elements, named `numberOfElements`.
2. Create a list (array) called `booleanList` with a size equal to `numberOfElements`, and initialize all elements in this list to `True`.
3. Set a variable `index` to 0, which keeps track of the current position in the `booleanList`.
4. Set another variable `step` to 1, which controls the increment of the index.
5. Begin a process that continues as long as `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the current position in `booleanList` (at `index`) is `True`.
     - If it is `True`:
       - Change the current position (at `index`) in `booleanList` to `False`.
   - Increment the `step` variable by 1.
   - Update the `index` by adding the current value of `step` and taking the result modulo `numberOfElements` to wrap around if necessary.
6. Collect all elements from `booleanList` that are still `True` into a new list called `trueElements`.
7. Check the length of `trueElements`:
   - If `trueElements` is empty (length is 0):
     - Output the message "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output the message "NO".
