# Read an integer input representing the size of the list
n = Read integer input

# Create a boolean list initialized to True with size n
isActive = Create a list of size n filled with True

# Initialize index variables for operation
currentIndex = 0
step = 1

# Loop until step exceeds 500,000
While step <= 500000 do:
    # If the current position in the list is marked True
    If isActive[currentIndex] is True then:
        # Mark the current position as False
        isActive[currentIndex] = False

    # Increment step counter
    step = step + 1
    
    # Update currentIndex using modulo operation for wrapping
    currentIndex = (currentIndex + step) modulo n

# Filter the list to find all active positions (True values)
activePositions = Create a list of elements in isActive that are True

# Check if there are no active positions remaining
If length of activePositions is 0 then:
    Output 'YES'  # No active positions remain
Else:
    Output 'NO'   # There are active positions remaining
