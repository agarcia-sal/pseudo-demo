**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input:**
   - Read an integer value `n` from user input.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Create a list `isPresent` of size `n`, initialized with `True`, to indicate that all positions are initially available.
   - Set a variable `index` to 0, which will track the current position in the list.
   - Set a variable `step` to 1, which will dictate how many positions to move forward after each iteration.

3. **Processing Loop:**
   - Repeat the following steps while `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the value at `isPresent[index]` is `True`, then:
       - Mark `isPresent[index]` as `False`, indicating that this position is no longer available.
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update `index` to be the next position calculated as `(index + step) mod n`, ensuring that we stay within the bounds of the list.

4. **Checking Results:**
   - Create a new list `availablePositions` that contains all the `True` values from `isPresent`, which represent the positions that remain available.
   - If the length of `availablePositions` is 0:
     - Print "YES" (indicating all positions have been marked as not available).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating there are still available positions).
