**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Input**
   - Read an integer value `n`, which represents the number of elements.

3. **Initialize**
   - Create a list `isAvailable` with `n` elements, all set to `True`.
   - Set `position` to 0 (this will track the current index in the list).
   - Set `step` to 1 (this represents the incrementing steps).

4. **Loop until step exceeds 500,000**
   - While `step` is less than or equal to 500,000, perform the following:
     - If `isAvailable[position]` is `True`, change `isAvailable[position]` to `False` (mark this position as unavailable).
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update `position` to be the remainder of the division of (`position` + `step`) by `n`. This ensures that the position wraps around the list.

5. **Check for available positions**
   - Create a new list `availablePositions` that contains all elements in `isAvailable` that are still set to `True`.

6. **Output Result**
   - If `availablePositions` has no elements (its length is 0):
     - Print "YES" (indicating all positions are marked unavailable).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating some positions are still available).

7. **End**
