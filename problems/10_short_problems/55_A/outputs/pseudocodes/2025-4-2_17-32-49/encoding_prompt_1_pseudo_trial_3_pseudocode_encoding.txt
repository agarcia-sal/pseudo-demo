Here's the translation of the provided code snippet into comprehensive pseudocode:

```
BEGIN

    // Input the size of the list
    SET sizeOfList TO read an integer from user input

    // Initialize a list of boolean values all set to True
    CREATE a list called booleanList with size sizeOfList, initialized to True

    // Initialize index variables
    SET indexIncrement TO 1
    SET currentIndex TO 0

    // Loop to mark elements in booleanList
    WHILE indexIncrement is less than or equal to 500000 DO
        
        // Check if the current index in booleanList is True
        IF booleanList[currentIndex] is True THEN
            
            // Mark the current index as False
            SET booleanList[currentIndex] TO False

        // Increment the index for the next step
        INCREMENT indexIncrement by 1
        
        // Update the currentIndex based on the next increment
        SET currentIndex TO (currentIndex + indexIncrement) MOD sizeOfList

    END WHILE

    // Create a list of all True values from booleanList
    SET filteredTrueValues TO a new list containing all values from booleanList that are True

    // Check if filteredTrueValues is empty
    IF length of filteredTrueValues is 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'
    END IF

END
```

### Summary of Logic:
1. The program first reads an integer that specifies the size of a list.
2. It initializes a list with boolean values set to True.
3. A loop iterates to mark certain indices of the list as False based on specific conditions.
4. After exiting the loop, it checks how many True values remain in the list.
5. If no True values are left, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
