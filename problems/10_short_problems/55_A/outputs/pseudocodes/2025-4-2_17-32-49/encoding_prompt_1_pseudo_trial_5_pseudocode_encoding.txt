**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start** the program.
2. **Input** a number `n` (the maximum size of the list).
3. **Create** a list `isAvailable` of size `n` and set all elements to `True`. This list will track available positions.
4. **Initialize** two variables: 
   - `currentPosition` to 0 (this will track the index in `isAvailable`)
   - `incrementValue` to 1 (this will be used to determine the current step size)
5. **Set a loop** to run while `incrementValue` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - **If** the element at `isAvailable[currentPosition]` is `True`:
     - **Set** `isAvailable[currentPosition]` to `False` (mark as unavailable)
   - **Increment** `incrementValue` by 1 (move to the next step)
   - **Update** `currentPosition` to the new position calculated by adding the `incrementValue` to `currentPosition` and taking the result modulo `n` (this wraps around if it exceeds the size of the list)
6. **Create** a new list `availablePositions` that includes all positions from `isAvailable` that are still `True` (i.e., positions that remain available).
7. **Check the length** of `availablePositions`:
   - **If** it is equal to 0:
     - **Output** "YES" (indicating all positions were made unavailable)
   - **Otherwise**:
     - **Output** "NO" (indicating there are still available positions)
8. **End** the program.
