**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**

2. **Input Requirement**: Read an integer value denoting a size, which will be referred to as totalElements.

3. **Initialize**: 
   - Create a list named isActive with totalElements elements, all set to True. This list will represent whether each element is active (True) or inactive (False).
   - Set a variable index to 0. This variable will be used to track the current position in the list.
   - Set a variable step to 1. This variable will track the number of steps taken in each iteration.

4. **Loop**: 
   - Continue looping while the step variable is less than or equal to 500,000.
     - Inside the loop:
       - Check if the element at the current index in the isActive list is still True.
         - If it is True, set that element in the isActive list to False (marking it as inactive).
       - Increase the step variable by 1 (to move to the next step).
       - Update the index by adding the current value of step to it and then take the remainder of the division by totalElements to wrap around if necessary.

5. **Filter Active Elements**: 
   - Create a new list named activeElements by including only those elements from the isActive list that are still True.

6. **Output Requirement**: 
   - Check if the length of the activeElements list is equal to 0.
     - If it is, print "YES" (indicating that all elements have been marked inactive).
     - Otherwise, print "NO" (indicating that there are still active elements).

7. **End**
