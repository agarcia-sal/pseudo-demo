Here is the pseudocode representation of the provided code snippet, capturing its intent and logic while emphasizing clarity and structure:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Obtain the input value for n
    INPUT number_of_elements AS INTEGER

    // Step 2: Initialize a boolean list to track the current state of numbers
    INITIALIZE is_active_list AS BOOLEAN LIST OF SIZE number_of_elements
    FOR EACH index FROM 0 TO number_of_elements - 1 DO
        SET is_active_list[index] TO TRUE
    END FOR

    // Step 3: Initialize counters for iteration
    SET current_index AS 0
    SET step AS 1

    // Step 4: Loop until the step count exceeds 500,000
    WHILE (step <= 500000) DO
        
        // Step 5: Check if the current position in the list is active
        IF (is_active_list[current_index]) THEN
            // Mark the current position as inactive
            SET is_active_list[current_index] TO FALSE
        END IF
        
        // Step 6: Move to the next step
        INCREMENT step BY 1
        // Update the current index using the formula modulus n
        SET current_index TO (current_index + step) MOD number_of_elements
    END WHILE

    // Step 7: Create a new list containing only the active elements
    INITIALIZE active_elements AS LIST
    FOR EACH element IN is_active_list DO
        IF (element IS TRUE) THEN
            ADD element TO active_elements
        END IF
    END FOR

    // Step 8: Check if there are any active elements remaining
    IF (LENGTH(active_elements) IS 0) THEN
        PRINT 'YES'  // All elements are inactive
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'   // There are still active elements
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
- **Input Handling:** The pseudocode begins by obtaining the integer input value that determines the size of an array.
- **List Initialization:** A boolean list is created to keep track of active statuses for each number.
- **Loop Structure:** It uses a while loop to mark numbers as inactive based on the given steps up to 500,000.
- **Final Check:** The pseudocode checks the state of the list after the loop's completion and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether any elements remain active. 

The pseudocode is organized to mirror the original algorithm's logical flow while being clear and easy to understand for someone unfamiliar with programming syntax.
