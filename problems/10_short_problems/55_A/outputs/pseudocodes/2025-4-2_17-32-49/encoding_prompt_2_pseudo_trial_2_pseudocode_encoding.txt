**Pseudocode:**

1. Start by getting an integer input that represents the total number of items, referred to as `number_of_items`.
   
2. Create a list called `is_active` with `number_of_items` elements, all initialized to True. This list will be used to track which items are still considered active.

3. Initialize two variables: 
   - `current_position` to 0, which will keep track of our current index in the list.
   - `step_count` to 1, which will represent how many steps to take to update our current position.

4. Begin a loop that continues while `step_count` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the item at the `current_position` in the `is_active` list is still active (True).
   - If it is active, mark it as inactive (set it to False).
   - Increment `step_count` by 1.
   - Update `current_position` to a new value by adding `step_count` to it, and then taking the modulus of `number_of_items` to ensure it wraps around within the bounds of the list.

5. After exiting the loop, create a new list called `remaining_active_items` that includes all active items from the `is_active` list (those that are still marked as True).

6. Check the length of `remaining_active_items`:
   - If the length is 0 (indicating that no items are active), then output "YES".
   - Otherwise, output "NO". 

 **End of pseudocode.**
