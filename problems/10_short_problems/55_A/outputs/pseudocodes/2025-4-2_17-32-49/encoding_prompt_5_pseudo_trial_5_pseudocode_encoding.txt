### Purpose Summary
The goal of this code is to determine whether a specific condition is met based on a series of operations that manipulate a list of boolean values. If all values in the list are changed to `False`, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Pseudocode

1. **Start Program**
2. **Input Section**
   - Prompt the user to enter a number `n` (convert the input to an integer).
   
3. **Initialization**
   - Create a list `booleanList` with `n` elements, all initially set to `True`.
   - Set a variable `currentIndex` to 0.
   - Set another variable `counter` to 1.

4. **Loop for Operations**
   - While `counter` is less than or equal to 500000:
     - If the current element in `booleanList` at `currentIndex` is `True`:
       - Change this element to `False`.
     - Increment `counter` by 1.
     - Update `currentIndex` to the new value calculated as `(currentIndex + counter) modulo n` (this ensures the index wraps around if it reaches the end of the list).

5. **Check Remaining True Values**
   - Create a new list `remainingTrue` containing all elements from `booleanList` that are still `True`.
   - If the length of `remainingTrue` is 0:
     - Print "YES" (indicating all elements have been set to `False`).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating some elements are still `True`).

### Comments for Clarity
- The boolean list `booleanList` is used to track which elements have been modified to `False`.
- The loop iteratively modifies the list based on a specific index calculation to ensure each position is addressed according to the defined logic.
- Finally, the check against the `remainingTrue` list determines the output.

### Example Structure of Pseudocode

```plaintext
START PROGRAM

INPUT n FROM USER

INITIALIZE booleanList WITH n ELEMENTS ALL SET TO TRUE
SET currentIndex TO 0
SET counter TO 1

WHILE counter â‰¤ 500000 DO
    IF booleanList[currentIndex] IS TRUE THEN
        SET booleanList[currentIndex] TO FALSE
    END IF
    
    INCREMENT counter BY 1
    UPDATE currentIndex TO (currentIndex + counter) MOD n
END WHILE

CREATE remainingTrue AS LIST OF TRUE ELEMENTS IN booleanList

IF LENGTH OF remainingTrue IS 0 THEN
    PRINT "YES"
ELSE
    PRINT "NO"
END IF

END PROGRAM
```

### Final Review
This pseudocode effectively communicates the logic and flow of the original code, employing clear language and structured formatting to enhance understanding for readers of various technical backgrounds.
