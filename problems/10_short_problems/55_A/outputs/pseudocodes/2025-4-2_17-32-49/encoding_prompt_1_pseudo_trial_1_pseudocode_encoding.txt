### Pseudocode

**Start**

1. **Set up input:**
   - Read an integer `n` from user input.

2. **Initialize a list:**
   - Create a list `isNotDeleted` of size `n` with all elements set to `True`.

3. **Set initial variables:**
   - Set `currentIndex` to `0`.
   - Set `i` to `1`.

4. **Loop through a range:**
   - While `i` is less than or equal to `500000` do the following:
       - If the element at `isNotDeleted[currentIndex]` is `True`:
           - Set `isNotDeleted[currentIndex]` to `False` (mark as deleted).
       - Increment `i` by `1`.
       - Update `currentIndex` to be `(currentIndex + i) modulo n` (wrap around if needed).

5. **Check for remaining True values:**
   - Create a new list `remainingTrue` containing all elements from `isNotDeleted` that are still `True`.

6. **Determine output based on remaining values:**
   - If the length of `remainingTrue` is `0`:
       - Print 'YES'.
   - Otherwise:
       - Print 'NO'.

**End**
