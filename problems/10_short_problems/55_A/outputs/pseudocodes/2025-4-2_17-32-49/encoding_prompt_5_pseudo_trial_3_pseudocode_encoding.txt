**Purpose:** The goal of the code is to determine if a certain pattern of marking elements (based on specific iterations) in a boolean list results in all elements being marked by the end of the process.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**
2. **Receive Input**
   - Read a number `n` which represents the size of a list.
3. **Initialize Boolean List**
   - Create a list `booleanList` of size `n` where each element is initialized to `True`. This represents that all positions are initially unmarked.
4. **Set Up Iteration Variables**
   - Initialize `currentIndex` to `0` (this will track the position in `booleanList`).
   - Initialize `step` to `1` (this will dictate how far to move through the list during marking).
5. **Mark Elements Process**
   - While `step` is less than or equal to `500000`:
     1. **Check Current Position**
        - If the value at `booleanList[currentIndex]` is `True`:
          - Mark this position as `False` (indicating that it has been marked).
     2. **Increment Step Value**
        - Increase `step` by `1`.
     3. **Calculate Next Position**
        - Update `currentIndex` to the new position using the formula `(currentIndex + step) % n`. This makes sure the index wraps around if it exceeds the length of the list.
6. **Extract Remaining Unmarked Elements**
   - Create a list `remainingTrue` containing all elements in `booleanList` that are still `True`.
7. **Check Results**
   - If the length of `remainingTrue` is `0` (no unmarked positions):
     - Print "YES" (indicating all positions were marked).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating at least one position remained unmarked).
8. **End Program**

**Comments:**

- The boolean list indicates whether each position has been marked or remains unmarked.
- The marking process uses a specific step incrementally increasing, demonstrating a pattern in how elements are processed.
- The result conveys whether the marking process successfully marked every element according to the defined logic.

This pseudocode maintains clarity by abstracting operations while clearly detailing the logic behind each step.
