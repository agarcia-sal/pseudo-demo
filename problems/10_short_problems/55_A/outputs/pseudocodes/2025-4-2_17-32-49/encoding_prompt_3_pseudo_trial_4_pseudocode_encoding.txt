**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Read the integer input for the size of the array
    SET numberOfElements TO integer input from user

    // Initialize a boolean array with 'True' values for each index
    CREATE boolean array isActive[0 to numberOfElements-1] AND SET all elements to True
    
    SET currentIndex TO 0
    SET incrementValue TO 1

    // Loop until the incrementValue exceeds 500,000
    WHILE incrementValue <= 500000 DO
        
        // If the current index in the boolean array is still marked as active
        IF isActive[currentIndex] THEN
            
            // Set the current index to inactive
            SET isActive[currentIndex] TO False
        
        // Move to the next increment
        INCREMENT incrementValue
        
        // Update the current index using modulo operation to wrap around the boolean array
        SET currentIndex TO (currentIndex + incrementValue) MOD numberOfElements
    
    // Create a list of active indices based on the boolean array
    SET activeElements TO list of indices from isActive where value is True
    
    // Check if there are any active elements remaining
    IF LENGTH(activeElements) IS 0 THEN
        OUTPUT 'YES' // No active elements found
    ELSE
        OUTPUT 'NO'  // Active elements still present

END
```

### Explanation of Pseudocode:

1. **Initialization:** The code begins by reading an integer input that signifies the number of elements in a boolean array. This array is initialized with all `True` values.

2. **Loop Control:** The main loop continues until a specified limit (500,000) is reached, during which it checks whether the current index in the boolean array is active or not.

3. **Index Management:** Inside the loop, if the current index is active, it gets marked as inactive. After that, the loop advances by increasing an increment value and updates the current index using a modulo operation to ensure it wraps around the bounds of the boolean array.

4. **Final Check:** After exiting the loop, the pseudocode constructs a list of all indices in the boolean array that remain active. If no indices are active after processing, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". 

This structured presentation helps to convey the logic behind the code without getting caught up in syntax, making it easier to understand the overall flow and purpose of the program.
