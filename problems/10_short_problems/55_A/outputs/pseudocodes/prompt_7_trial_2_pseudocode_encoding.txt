Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided code, following the instructions outlined:

```
FUNCTION checkCondition(n) 
    INITIALIZE boolean list isAvailable with size n, all set to True
    INITIALIZE index to 0
    INITIALIZE increment to 1

    WHILE increment is less than or equal to 500000 DO
        IF isAvailable[index] is True THEN
            SET isAvailable[index] to False
        END IF
        
        INCREMENT increment by 1
        UPDATE index to (index + increment) modulo n
    END WHILE
    
    INITIALIZE availableCount to count of True values in isAvailable
    
    IF availableCount is equal to 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'    // All conditions were met
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'     // There are still available spots
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode Logic:

1. **Function Definition**: The pseudocode begins by defining a function `checkCondition` that takes an integer `n` as input. This represents the size of a boolean list.

2. **Boolean List Initialization**: A list `isAvailable` is created, initialized to `True` for all indices, indicating that they are initially available.

3. **Control Variables**: Two variables, `index` (starting at 0) and `increment` (starting at 1), are set up to manage the loop and indexing.

4. **Main Loop**: A `WHILE` loop runs as long as the `increment` is less than or equal to 500,000. Inside this loop:
   - If the current index of `isAvailable` is `True`, it is set to `False`.
   - The `increment` is then incremented by 1.
   - The `index` is updated using modulo operation to stay within bounds of `isAvailable`.

5. **Counting**: After exiting the loop, the pseudocode counts the number of `True` values in `isAvailable`.

6. **Output Decision**: Finally, an `IF` statement checks the count of available positions:
   - If there are no available spots (`availableCount == 0`), it prints `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

### Output Context:
This pseudocode illustrates the logic behind checking conditions across a defined range and determining the availability of elements effectively. The reader can now understand the purpose and flow without needing to delve into specific programming syntax or semantics.
