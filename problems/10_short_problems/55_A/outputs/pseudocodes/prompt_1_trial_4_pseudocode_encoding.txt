**Pseudocode:**

1. Start by reading an integer value `n` from user input.
2. Create a list called `booleanList` of size `n`, initialized with `True` values.
3. Set a variable `index` to 0, which will track the current position in `booleanList`.
4. Set a variable `increment` to 1, which will determine how much to move the index.
5. While `increment` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - If the value at `booleanList[index]` is `True`:
     - Set `booleanList[index]` to `False` (indicating a position has been processed).
   - Increment `increment` by 1.
   - Update `index` to the new position calculated by moving forward `increment` steps, wrapped around using modulo `n`.
6. Create a new list called `trueValues` that contains all `True` values from `booleanList`.
7. If the length of `trueValues` is 0:
   - Print "YES" (indicating all positions were processed).
8. Otherwise:
   - Print "NO" (indicating some positions remain unprocessed).
