Here's a clear and understandable pseudocode representation of the provided algorithm:

```
1. Read an integer value n from the user input.
2. Create a boolean list 'is_active' of size n and initialize all values to True.
3. Set variable 'current_index' to 0.
4. Set variable 'step' to 1.

5. While 'step' is less than or equal to 500000:
    a. If 'is_active[current_index]' is True:
        i. Set 'is_active[current_index]' to False    // Mark the current_index as inactive
        
    b. Increment 'step' by 1.
    
    c. Update 'current_index' to (current_index + step) modulo n   // Move to the next index cyclically

6. Create a list 'remaining_active' containing all elements from 'is_active' that are still True.

7. If the length of 'remaining_active' is 0:
    a. Print "YES"   // All positions were marked inactive
Else:
    b. Print "NO"    // There are some positions still active
```

### Explanation:
- The pseudocode initializes a boolean array which keeps track of active positions.
- It iterates through a loop, marking certain positions as inactive based on the current step being processed.
- After completing the iterations, it checks if any positions remain active and provides output accordingly, indicating whether all positions have been marked inactive or not.
