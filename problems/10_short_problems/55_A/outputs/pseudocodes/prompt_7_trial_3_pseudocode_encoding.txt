Below is the high-level pseudocode that accurately describes the logic and operations of the provided code, complete with explanations to enhance understanding.

```
FUNCTION checkAllFalseInList(n)
    // Initialize a list to track boolean values
    INITIALIZE booleanList AS a list of True with length n
    
    // Set initial indices
    SET indexToModify = 0
    SET counter = 1
    
    // Loop until counter reaches 500000
    WHILE counter <= 500000 DO
        // If the current boolean value is True, set it to False
        IF booleanList[indexToModify] IS True THEN
            SET booleanList[indexToModify] TO False
        END IF

        // Increment the counter for the next iteration
        INCREMENT counter
        // Update indexToModify to the next position using the formula
        SET indexToModify = (indexToModify + counter) MOD n
    END WHILE
    
    // Collect all the True values from the boolean list
    SET remainingTrueValues AS a list of values from booleanList where value IS True
    
    // Check if there are any True values left
    IF LENGTH of remainingTrueValues IS 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES' // All values are set to False
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO' // There are still True values in the list
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of Key Components:

1. **Initialization**: A list `booleanList` of size `n` is created and initialized to `True`. This signifies an assumption that all entries start as 'True'.

2. **Index Management**: Two counters, `indexToModify` and `counter`, are used to control which entry in the list is modified and how many times the loop has run.

3. **Looping Logic**: A loop runs until a specified iteration counter (500,000) is reached, ensuring that entries in `booleanList` are set to `False` based on the current index and the loop's iteration.

4. **Condition Checking**: After completing the iterations, the pseudocode checks if there are any remaining `True` values left in `booleanList`.

5. **Output**: Based on the presence or absence of `True` values, it prints 'YES' if all values are `False`, and 'NO' if any `True` values remain.

This pseudocode captures the intent and flow of the original code while using meaningful names and structured control statements for clarity.
