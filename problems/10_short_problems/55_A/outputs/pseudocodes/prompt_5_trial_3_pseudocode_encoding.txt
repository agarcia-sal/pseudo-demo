### Purpose Summary:
The goal of this code is to determine whether a specific sequence of operations, conducted on a list of boolean values, results in all values being set to `False`. If any values remain `True`, the output is "NO"; otherwise, the output is "YES".

### Pseudocode Explanation:

1. **Initialize the Input:**
   - Read an integer value named `numberOfElements` to determine the size of a list.
   
2. **Create a Boolean List:**
   - Create a list named `booleanList` filled with `True`, with a length equal to `numberOfElements`.

3. **Set Up Iteration Variables:**
   - Initialize a variable `index` to 0. This will track the current position in the `booleanList`.
   - Initialize a variable `step` to 1. This will control the advancing steps through the list.

4. **Loop through Defined Range:**
   - Start a loop that continues until the `step` variable exceeds 500,000:
     - If the value at `booleanList[index]` is `True`:
       - Set `booleanList[index]` to `False`, marking this position as modified.
     - Increment the `step` variable by 1 to determine the next step.
     - Update `index` by adding the current `step` value and using modulo operation with `numberOfElements` to ensure it wraps around within the list.

5. **Check Remaining True Values:**
   - Create a new list named `remainingTrueValues` that collects all values from `booleanList` that are still `True`.
   
6. **Determine Output Based on Remaining Values:**
   - If `remainingTrueValues` is empty (indicating all values were set to `False`):
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

### Complete Pseudocode:

```
BEGIN
    // Step 1: Read the number of elements
    numberOfElements = READ_INTEGER()

    // Step 2: Initialize the boolean list
    booleanList = CREATE_LIST_OF_TRUE_VALUES(numberOfElements)

    // Step 3: Initialize index and step
    index = 0
    step = 1

    // Step 4: Begin looping until step exceeds 500,000
    WHILE (step <= 500000) DO
        IF (booleanList[index] IS TRUE) THEN
            // Mark the current position as False
            booleanList[index] = FALSE
        END IF
        
        // Increment step for the next iteration
        step = step + 1
        
        // Update the index to the next position, wrapping around using modulo
        index = (index + step) MOD numberOfElements
    END WHILE

    // Step 5: Collect remaining True values
    remainingTrueValues = COLLECT_TRUE_VALUES_FROM(booleanList)
    
    // Step 6: Determine the result based on the remaining values
    IF (LENGTH(remainingTrueValues) == 0) THEN
        PRINT("YES")
    ELSE
        PRINT("NO")
    END IF
END
```

### Comments:
- This pseudocode avoids technical jargon and uses descriptive names for clarity.
- The operations such as list creation, condition checking, and iteration through elements are simplified for better understanding.
- Each step is broken down to ensure that even readers unfamiliar with programming principles can grasp the core logic and functionalities.
