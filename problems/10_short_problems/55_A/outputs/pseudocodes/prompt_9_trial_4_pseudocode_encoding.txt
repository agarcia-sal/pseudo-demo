**Purpose:**  
To determine if a certain condition regarding a series of boolean values is met, based on a sequence of operations that modifies the boolean values.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set `number_of_elements` to the user input value (an integer).
   - Create a list `boolean_array` with `number_of_elements` entries, all initially set to `True`.
   - Set `index` to 0 (to track current position in `boolean_array`).
   - Set `increment` to 1 (to determine how far to move in the array).

2. **Loop Through a Sequence:**
   - While `increment` is less than or equal to 500000:
     - If the value at `boolean_array[index]` is `True`:
       - Change `boolean_array[index]` to `False` (mark this position).
     - Increase `increment` by 1.
     - Update `index` to the new position by adding `increment` to `index` and taking the modulus with `number_of_elements` to stay within bounds of the array.

3. **Check for True Values:**
   - Create a new list `remaining_true_values` that contains all elements from `boolean_array` that are still `True`.

4. **Output Result:**
   - If the length of `remaining_true_values` is 0:
     - Print "YES" (indicating that all values were marked as False).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating that there are still `True` values in the list). 

**High-Level Logic:**
- We use an array of booleans to represent states, modifying them based on a defined sequence of steps. The final outcome depends on whether any booleans remain `True` after processing. 

This pseudocode simplifies the original code while preserving its intent and functionality. It clearly outlines the process and conditions without relying on programming syntax.
