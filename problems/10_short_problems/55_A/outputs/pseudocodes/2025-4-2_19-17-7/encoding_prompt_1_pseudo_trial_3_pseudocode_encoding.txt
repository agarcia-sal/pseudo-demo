**Pseudocode**

1. **Input:** Read an integer `n` from the user.
 
2. **Initialize the Boolean List:**
   - Create a list `isPresent` of size `n` where each element is set to `True`.

3. **Set Initial Values:**
   - Set an integer variable `currentIndex` to 0.
   - Set an integer variable `step` to 1.

4. **Loop Until Step Exceeds 500,000:**
   - While `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     1. Check if the value at `isPresent[currentIndex]` is `True`:
        - If it is `True`, set `isPresent[currentIndex]` to `False` (mark this index as processed).
     2. Increment `step` by 1.
     3. Update `currentIndex` to `(currentIndex + step) modulo n` (move to the next index in a circular manner).

5. **Collect Unprocessed Indices:**
   - Create a new list `unprocessedItems` to store indices where the value is still `True` in `isPresent`.

6. **Check Results:**
   - If the length of `unprocessedItems` is 0:
     - Print "YES" (indicating all items were processed).
   - Else:
     - Print "NO" (indicating there are unprocessed items).
