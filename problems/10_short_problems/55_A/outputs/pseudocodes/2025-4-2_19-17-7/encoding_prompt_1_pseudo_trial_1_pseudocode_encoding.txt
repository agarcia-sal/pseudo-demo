**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input the number of elements**:
   - Read an integer value `n` from the user.

2. **Initialize a boolean list**:
   - Create a list `isPrime` of size `n`, where all elements are initially set to `True`.

3. **Initialize variables**:
   - Set a variable `step` to 1, which will represent the current step in our iteration process.
   - Set a variable `index` to 0, which will track the current position in the `isPrime` list.

4. **Loop to iterate a maximum of 500,000 times**:
   - While `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the value at the current `index` in `isPrime` is True:
       - Set the value at that position in `isPrime` to False.
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update the `index` to the next position using the formula `(current index + current step) % n`.

5. **Collect remaining True values**:
   - Create a new list `remainingTrue` that contains all elements from `isPrime` that are still True.

6. **Check the result**:
   - If `remainingTrue` is empty:
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO". 

This pseudocode outlines the key steps and logic of the original code without getting into syntax details, providing a clear understanding of the flow and control structures.
