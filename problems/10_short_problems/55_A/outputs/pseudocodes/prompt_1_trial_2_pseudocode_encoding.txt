**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Input:**
   - Read an integer `n` from user input.

2. **Create Boolean Array:**
   - Create a list `isAlive` of size `n` where all elements are initially set to `True`. This list represents the state of each position, indicating if it's "alive" (True) or "dead" (False).

3. **Initialize Counters:**
   - Set counter `currentStep` to 1.
   - Set index `currentIndex` to 0.

4. **Loop Until Limit:**
   - While `currentStep` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If `isAlive[currentIndex]` is True:
       - Set `isAlive[currentIndex]` to False (mark this position as "dead").
     - Increment `currentStep` by 1.
     - Update `currentIndex` to `(currentIndex + currentStep) modulo n` (wrap around if it exceeds `n`).

5. **Collect Remaining Alive Positions:**
   - Create a new list `remainingAlive` containing only the elements from `isAlive` that are still True.

6. **Check for Remaining Alive Positions:**
   - If the length of `remainingAlive` is 0:
     - Output "YES" (indicating all positions are dead).
   - Otherwise, output "NO" (indicating at least one position is alive).
