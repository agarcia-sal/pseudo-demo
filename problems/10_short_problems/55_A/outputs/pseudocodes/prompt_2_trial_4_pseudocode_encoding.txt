**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read an integer value `n` from the user. This represents the size of a list.

2. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a list called `isMarked` with `n` elements, all set to `True`. 
     - This list keeps track of which positions have been "marked" or processed.

3. **Set Initial Values:**
   - Set a variable `currentPosition` to 0 to track the current index in the list.
   - Set a variable `step` to 1 to determine how far to jump in each iteration.

4. **Process Marking:**
   - While the value of `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the current position in `isMarked` is still `True` (not marked yet):
       - Mark the current position as `False` (indicating it has been processed).
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update `currentPosition` to move forward by the new value of `step`, wrapping around using modulo `n` to stay within the bounds of the list.

5. **Check Marking Results:**
   - Create a new list called `unmarkedPositions` that contains all `True` values from `isMarked`. 
     - This list represents positions that were never marked.

6. **Output Result:**
   - If the length of `unmarkedPositions` is 0:
     - Print 'YES' (indicating all positions were marked).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print 'NO' (indicating there are still unmarked positions). 

This description breaks down the core logic and flow of the original code into a high-level understanding, focusing on its purpose and operations while using clear variable names.
