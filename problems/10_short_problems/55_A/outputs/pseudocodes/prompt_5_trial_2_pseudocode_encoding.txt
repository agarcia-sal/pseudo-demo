**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to determine whether there are any unmarked positions in a list, based on a specific marking process. If all positions are marked, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO."

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get user input:**
   - Read a number `n` which indicates the number of positions in a list.

2. **Initialize a list:**
   - Create a list `markedPositions` of size `n`, where each element is initially set to `True`. This list keeps track of whether each position is marked (True) or unmarked (False).

3. **Set indexing variables:**
   - Initialize a variable `currentIndex` to 0. This variable will track the index of the position we are currently marking.
   - Initialize a variable `increment` to 1. This will help us calculate the next position to mark.

4. **Marking process:**
   - Repeat the following process while `increment` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the position at `currentIndex` in `markedPositions` is still marked (True):
       - Change that position to unmarked (False).
     - Increase `increment` by 1.
     - Calculate the next `currentIndex` by adding `increment` to the current `currentIndex`, then use the modulus operator with `n` to wrap around within the bounds of the list.

5. **Check unmarked positions:**
   - Create a new list `unmarkedPositions` that contains all positions in `markedPositions` where the value is still True.

6. **Determine the output:**
   - If the `unmarkedPositions` list is empty:
     - Print "YES" (indicating all positions are marked).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating there are still unmarked positions).

**Comments:**
- This pseudocode simplifies the logic without leaning on specific programming syntax.
- The use of `currentIndex` and `increment` illustrates the marking logic in a clear manner, ensuring comprehension.
