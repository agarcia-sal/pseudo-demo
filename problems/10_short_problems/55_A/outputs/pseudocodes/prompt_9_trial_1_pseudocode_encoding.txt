**Purpose:** Determine if there exists any unmarked position in a circular list after processing a sequence of iterations.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read an integer value `n` representing the size of the list.

2. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a list called `positions` of size `n` and set all elements to `True`, indicating that all positions are initially unmarked.

3. **Set Starting Variables:**
   - Initialize a variable `current_position` to 0, which will track the index in the list.
   - Initialize a variable `step_count` to 1, representing the current step in the iteration.

4. **Loop Until Step Count Exceeds Limit:**
   - While `step_count` is less than or equal to 500,000 do the following:
     - If the position at `current_position` is `True` (unmarked):
       - Mark the position as `False` (indicating it is now marked).
     - Increment `step_count` by 1.
     - Update `current_position` to `(current_position + step_count) % n` to ensure it wraps around the list.

5. **Collect Remaining Unmarked Positions:**
   - Create a new list called `unmarked_positions` that includes all entries from `positions` that are still `True`.

6. **Check for Unmarked Positions:**
   - If the length of `unmarked_positions` is equal to 0:
     - Print 'YES'.
   - Otherwise:
     - Print 'NO'.

**Note:** This pseudocode provides a clear, intuitive representation of the algorithm's flow and logic without focusing on specific programming syntax, ensuring that it is accessible to a broader audience.
