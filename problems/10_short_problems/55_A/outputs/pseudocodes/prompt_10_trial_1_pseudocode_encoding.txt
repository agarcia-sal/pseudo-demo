Here's a clear and concise pseudocode translation based on the provided code, organized according to the guided steps:

### Pseudocode

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Define integer variable `n` to store user input as the size of the list.
   - Create a list `b` of boolean values initialized to True, with a length of `n`.
   - Set integer variables `j` to 0 and `i` to 1.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   - Start a loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 500,000.

3. **Conditional Logic:**
   - Inside the loop, check if the value at index `j` in list `b` is True:
     - If it is True, set `b[j]` to False.

4. **Increment Variables:**
   - Increment `i` by 1.
   - Update `j` to the value of `(j + i) modulo n`.

5. **Filter Remaining Values:**
   - Create a new list `x` containing all elements from `b` that are still True.

6. **Final Conditional Check:**
   - If the length of list `x` is equal to 0:
     - Output "YES"
   - Else:
     - Output "NO"

### Assumptions:
- The variable `n` is expected to be a positive integer.
- The list `b` contains boolean values, initialized to True for every index up to `n`.
- The operations within the loop are valid, and `j` will always reference a valid index of list `b` by the modulo operation.

### Full Pseudocode

```
SET n = input(integer) // Get user input for the size of the array
CREATE list b with size n, initialized to True
SET j = 0
SET i = 1

WHILE i <= 500000 DO
    IF b[j] is True THEN
        SET b[j] = False // Mark the index as not valid
    
    INCREMENT i by 1
    SET j = (j + i) MOD n // Update index j using modulo to wrap around

// Create list x with elements from b that are True
CREATE list x with elements of b where value is True

IF length of x is 0 THEN
    PRINT "YES"
ELSE
    PRINT "NO"
```

In this pseudocode, we have streamlined the logic and used clear terms to express the operations of the program while adhering to structured language concepts.
