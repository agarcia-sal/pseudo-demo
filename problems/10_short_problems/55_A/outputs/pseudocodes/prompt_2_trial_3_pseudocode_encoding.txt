**Pseudocode:**

1. Start the process.

2. Retrieve a number called `totalNumbers` from the user input. This number represents how many elements will be processed.

3. Create a list named `isAvailable` with `totalNumbers` elements, and initialize all elements to indicate "True", meaning they are available.

4. Initialize a variable `currentIndex` to 0, which will keep track of the current position in the `isAvailable` list.

5. Initialize a variable `increment` to 1, which will control the step size for moving through the list.

6. Begin a loop that continues as long as `increment` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the current position indicated by `currentIndex` in the `isAvailable` list is "True":
     - If it is "True", set that position to "False", indicating it is no longer available.
   - Increment the `increment` variable by 1, effectively increasing the step size for the next loop iteration.
   - Update `currentIndex` to point to the next position by adding `increment` to it and using the modulus operator with `totalNumbers` to wrap around if it exceeds the length of the list.

7. After exiting the loop, create a new list named `availableItems` which contains only the elements from `isAvailable` that remain "True".

8. Check if the length of `availableItems` is 0:
   - If it is, output "YES" indicating all items have been marked as unavailable.
   - Otherwise, output "NO" indicating there are still available items.

9. End the process.
