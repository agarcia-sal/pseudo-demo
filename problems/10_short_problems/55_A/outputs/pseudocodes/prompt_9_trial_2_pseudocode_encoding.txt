### Purpose:
This algorithm is designed to determine whether certain conditions are met based on a sequence of boolean values, specifically checking if any boolean values remain `True` after applying a set of operations.

### Pseudocode:

1. **Input the value:**
   - Read a positive integer `totalCount` from the user.

2. **Initialize a list of boolean values:**
   - Create a list `booleanList` with `totalCount` elements, all initially set to `True`.
   
3. **Initialize index variables:**
   - Set the variable `step` to 1.
   - Set the variable `currentIndex` to 0.

4. **Perform operations:**
   - While `step` is less than or equal to 500,000, do the following:
     - If the value at `currentIndex` in `booleanList` is `True`, change it to `False`.
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update `currentIndex` to the next position calculated by `(currentIndex + step) % totalCount`.

5. **Check for remaining `True` values:**
   - Create a new list `trueValues` containing all values from `booleanList` that are still `True`.

6. **Determine the output:**
   - If the length of `trueValues` is 0, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

### Summary:
This pseudocode outlines the high-level logic to track and modify a list of boolean values based on certain conditions. It effectively checks whether any values remain `True` after a specified number of operations, which affects the output.
