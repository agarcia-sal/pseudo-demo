**Purpose**: The goal of the code is to determine whether all elements in a list can be marked as "False" through a specific iteration process. If all can be marked, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Input the size of the list**:
   - Read an integer value (n) which indicates the number of elements in the list.

2. **Initialize a list to track boolean values**:
   - Create a list called `isMarked` with n elements, all initialized to True (representing that they are unmarked).

3. **Set initial variables for iteration**:
   - Initialize a variable `currentIndex` to 0 (starting position in the list).
   - Initialize a variable `stepCount` to 1 (determines how many positions to move).

4. **Start a loop to iterate while the step count is less than or equal to 500,000**:
   - While `stepCount` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - Check if the current position (using `currentIndex`) in the `isMarked` list is True:
       - If it is True, mark it as False (indicating it has been processed).
     - Increment `stepCount` by 1 (moving to the next step).
     - Calculate the next position in the list using the formula: 
       - Update `currentIndex` to `(currentIndex + stepCount) % n` (which wraps around if it exceeds the list length).

5. **Check how many elements remain unmarked**:
   - Create a new list `unmarkedElements` which includes all elements from `isMarked` that are still True.

6. **Determine and output the result**:
   - If there are no unmarked elements in `unmarkedElements` (its length is 0):
     - Output "YES" (indicating that all can be marked).
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO" (indicating that there remain unmarked elements).

**Comments**:
- The list `isMarked` acts as a flag for whether each index has been processed or not.
- The while loop continues until 500,000 steps are completed, checking and updating the marking procedure based on the increasing step count.
- The modulo operation ensures that the index wraps around the length of the list, maintaining the circular nature of how positions are processed.
