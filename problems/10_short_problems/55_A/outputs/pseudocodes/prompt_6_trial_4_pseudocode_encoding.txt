Here is the pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Read an integer input representing the size
    SET size TO integer input from user
    // Create a boolean list initialized to True for all indices
    SET boolList TO a list of size elements, all initialized to True

    // Initialize index variables
    SET currentIndex TO 0
    SET stepSize TO 1

    // Loop until stepSize exceeds 500,000
    WHILE stepSize IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 500,000 DO
        
        // If the current position in the boolean list is True
        IF boolList[currentIndex] IS TRUE THEN
            // Set the current position to False
            SET boolList[currentIndex] TO FALSE
        END IF

        // Increment the stepSize
        INCREMENT stepSize BY 1

        // Update the currentIndex with the new position
        SET currentIndex TO (currentIndex + stepSize) MOD size
    END WHILE

    // Create a new list containing all True values from the boolean list
    SET trueValues TO a list of elements from boolList that are TRUE

    // Check if there are any True values left
    IF length of trueValues IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
        // If no True values are found, print 'YES'
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        // If there are True values, print 'NO'
        PRINT 'NO'
    END IF

END
```

### Summary of Logic:
1. The program initializes a boolean list based on user input size.
2. It performs a loop that modifies values in the list according to certain conditions, up to a maximum of 500,000 iterations.
3. After the loop, it checks if any values in the list remain `True` and accordingly prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. 

This structure provides a high-level overview that is easy to understand for those unfamiliar with programming syntax.
