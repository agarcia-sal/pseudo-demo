**Pseudocode:**

1. Start by reading an integer input number, which represents the size of an array, and assign it to the variable `size`.
2. Create a boolean list named `isAvailable` with a length of `size`. Initialize all elements in this list to `True` to indicate that they are initially available.
3. Initialize two counters: `currentIndex` starting at 0 and `step` starting at 1.
4. Begin a loop that continues as long as the `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Within the loop, check if the element at `currentIndex` in the `isAvailable` list is `True`.
     - If it is `True`, set this element to `False`, indicating it is no longer available.
   - Increment the `step` counter by 1.
   - Update `currentIndex` by adding `step` to it, and then find the remainder when divided by `size` to ensure it wraps around the array if necessary.
5. After the loop concludes, create a new list called `availableItems` containing all elements from `isAvailable` that are still `True`.
6. Check if there are any items left in the `availableItems` list:
   - If the length of `availableItems` is 0, output the message 'YES', indicating all items have been marked as unavailable.
   - Otherwise, output the message 'NO', indicating there are still available items.

**Summary of Input and Output:**
- Input: An integer representing the size of the array.
- Output: A message 'YES' if all items are marked as unavailable; otherwise, 'NO'.
