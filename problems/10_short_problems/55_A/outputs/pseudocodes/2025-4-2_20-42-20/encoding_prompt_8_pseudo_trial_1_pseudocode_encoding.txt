### Purpose Summary
The goal of this code is to determine whether there are any elements in a list that remain marked as true after performing a series of operations. Specifically, it manipulates the list based on a pattern and checks if any elements are still true, printing "YES" if none are true and "NO" otherwise.

### Pseudocode

1. **Read Input**
   - Get an integer value `n` which represents the size of a list.

2. **Initialize List**
   - Create a list `isActive` of size `n` filled with `True`. This list keeps track of whether each position is active.

3. **Set Counters**
   - Set a variable `currentPosition` to 0. This variable indicates our current position in the list.
   - Set a variable `stepCount` to 1. This variable determines the step size for each iteration.

4. **Loop Until Condition Met**
   - While `stepCount` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the value at `isActive[currentPosition]` is `True`:
       - Set `isActive[currentPosition]` to `False` (mark this position as inactive).
     - Increment `stepCount` by 1.
     - Update `currentPosition` to be `(currentPosition + stepCount) mod n`. (This will wrap around the list to ensure we remain within bounds.)

5. **Check Active Positions**
   - Create a new list `inactivePositions` containing all positions in `isActive` that are still `True`.

6. **Output Result**
   - If `inactivePositions` is empty (meaning all positions are inactive):
     - Print "YES" (indicating that every position got marked inactive).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating that at least one position remains active).

### Comments for Clarity
- The list `isActive` starts with all elements as active (`True`).
- The iterations incrementally increase consideration of positions in a wrapping manner (using modulo).
- The final output depends on whether any elements remain `True` after the marking process. 

### Example Structure
This pseudocode is structured to clearly depict the flow of operations and the control logic. Each step is written in natural language that avoids technical jargon, making it understandable for readers who may not have a programming background.
