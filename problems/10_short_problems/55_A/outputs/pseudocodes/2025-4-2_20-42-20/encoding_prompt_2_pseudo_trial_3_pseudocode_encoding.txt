**Pseudocode:**

1. Start the program.
2. Declare an integer variable 'number_of_elements' and read its value from user input.
3. Create a list called 'boolean_list' with 'number_of_elements' entries, all set to True.
4. Initialize two integer variables: 'position' set to 0 and 'increment' set to 1.
5. Repeat the following steps while 'increment' is less than or equal to 500,000:
   a. Check if the current entry in 'boolean_list' at index 'position' is True.
      - If it is True, set that entry to False.
   b. Increase 'increment' by 1.
   c. Update 'position' to be the current 'position' plus 'increment', and use the modulus operation to ensure 'position' stays within the bounds of 'number_of_elements'.
6. Create a new list called 'remaining_true_values' which contains all entries from 'boolean_list' that are still True.
7. If the length of 'remaining_true_values' is equal to 0:
      a. Output 'YES'.
8. Otherwise:
      a. Output 'NO'.
9. End the program.
