**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to determine whether a specific condition is met based on a series of iterations and updates to a list of boolean values.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Receive Input:**
   - Read an integer `n`, which represents the size of a boolean list.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a list `booleanList` of size `n` where all elements are set to `True`.
   - Set `index` to 0 (this will track the current position in the list).
   - Set `counter` to 1 (this will be used to determine how far to move in each iteration).

3. **Loop through a Range:**
   - While `counter` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the value at `booleanList[index]` is `True`:
       - Set `booleanList[index]` to `False` (mark it as processed).
     - Increment `counter` by 1.
     - Update `index` using the formula `(index + counter) modulo n` to wrap around if necessary.

4. **Check for Remaining True Values:**
   - Create a new list `remainingTrueValues` that contains all elements from `booleanList` that are still `True`.

5. **Determine Output:**
   - If the length of `remainingTrueValues` is equal to 0:
     - Print "YES" (indicating all values have been processed).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating some values remain `True`).

This pseudocode effectively captures the logical structure of the original code while utilizing descriptive variable names and simplifying the overall steps for clarity.
