**Pseudocode for the Given Algorithm:**

```
Input: 
    n = an integer value representing the size of the array

Initialize an array 'isAlive' of size n with all values set to True
Set currentIndex to 0
Set stepCount to 1

While stepCount is less than or equal to 500000:
    If isAlive[currentIndex] is True:
        Mark isAlive[currentIndex] as False (the person is "eliminated")
    Increment stepCount by 1
    Update currentIndex to (currentIndex + stepCount) modulo n (wrap around if needed)

Create a new list 'remaining' containing all values from isAlive that are still True

If the length of 'remaining' is 0:
    Output "YES" (no one is alive)
Else:
    Output "NO" (there are still people alive)
```

### Summary of Operations:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an array to track which positions (or people) are still "alive".
   
2. **Elimination Process**:
   - Loop up to a maximum of 500,000 times.
   - In each iteration, if the current index corresponds to an "alive" person, mark them as "eliminated".
   - Update the next index based on the current step count, ensuring to wrap around using modulus with n.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, collect all positions that are still "alive".
   - Check if any positions remain alive and print the appropriate message. 

This pseudocode maintains the core logic and flow of the original code in a clearer and more accessible way.
