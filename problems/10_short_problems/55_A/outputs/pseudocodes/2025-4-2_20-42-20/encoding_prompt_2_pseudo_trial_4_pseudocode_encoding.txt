**Pseudocode:**

1. Start the process.
2. Read an integer value `n` from the user, representing the size of an array.
3. Initialize an array `isPrime` of size `n` with all values set to `True`. This indicates that all positions are initially considered prime.
4. Set a variable `currentIndex` to 0, which will be used to track the position in the array.
5. Set another variable `step` to 1, which will control the increment for the current index.
6. Begin a loop that continues as long as `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the value at the position `currentIndex` in the array `isPrime` is `True`.
     - If it is `True`, change the value at `currentIndex` to `False` (marking it as not prime).
   - Increment the `step` by 1.
   - Update `currentIndex` to be the new position calculated by adding `step` to the current value of `currentIndex`, and then taking the result modulo `n` to wrap around if necessary.
7. Create a new list `untouchedIndices`, which contains all the values from `isPrime` that remain `True`. This will represent the positions that were not marked as not prime during the loop.
8. Check the length of `untouchedIndices`:
   - If there are no `True` values left (i.e., the length is zero), print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".
9. End the process.
