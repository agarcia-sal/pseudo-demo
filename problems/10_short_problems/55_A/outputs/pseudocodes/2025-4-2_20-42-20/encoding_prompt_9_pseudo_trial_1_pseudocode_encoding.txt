**Purpose:** The goal of this algorithm is to determine whether all values in a list become marked as "not true" (or false) based on a specific marking process, and to print "YES" if they do, and "NO" if at least one remains marked as "true".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Get the total number of elements `n` from the user.

2. **Initialize the Marking List:**
   - Create a list named `markings` with `n` elements, all initially set to `True` to indicate they are all unmarked.

3. **Set Initial Variables:**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0, which tracks the current position in the `markings` list.
   - Set a variable `step` to 1, which indicates the current counting step.

4. **Start the Marking Process:**
   - While `step` is less than or equal to 500000:
     - If the current item in `markings` at position `index` is `True`:
       - Change the current item to `False` (mark it as processed).
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update `index` to be the new position, calculated as the sum of the previous `index` and the `step`, wrapped around using modulo `n` (this handles the circular nature of the list).

5. **Check Remaining Marked Items:**
   - Create a new list named `remainingTrue` that contains only those items from `markings` that are still `True`.

6. **Output Result:**
   - If the length of `remainingTrue` is 0 (meaning all items were marked):
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

**Summary of Logic:**
- This algorithm continuously marks items in a list through a controlled count until a specific limit is reached. After processing, it checks if any item remained unmarked and provides an appropriate message based on the result of that check.
