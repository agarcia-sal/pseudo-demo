**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
2. **Input:** Read an integer value `n` which represents the number of elements.
3. **Initialize:** Create a list `b` of size `n`, filled with `True` values. This list will track whether each position is marked.
4. **Initialize:** Set `j` to 0 and `i` to 1. These will be used to navigate through the list.
5. **Loop:** While `i` is less than or equal to 500,000 do the following:
   - **Check Condition:** If the value at position `j` in list `b` is `True`:
     - Set the value at position `j` in list `b` to `False`, marking it.
   - **Increment:** Increase the value of `i` by 1.
   - **Update `j`:** Set `j` to the value of `(j + i) modulo n`, ensuring it wraps around if necessary.
6. **Extract Result:** Create a new list `x` consisting of all `True` values from list `b`.
7. **Check Length:** If the length of list `x` is zero (meaning all positions were marked):
   - **Output:** Print "YES"
8. **Else:**
   - **Output:** Print "NO"
9. **End**
