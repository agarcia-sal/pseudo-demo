Below is the pseudocode translation of the given code, following the guided steps:

### Pseudocode

```
1. Start

2. Define integer variable n
3. Read input value and assign it to n

4. Create a list b of size n, initializing all elements to True
5. Initialize integer variable j to 0
6. Initialize integer variable i to 1

7. While i is less than or equal to 500000 do:
   a. If b[j] is True then:
      i. Set b[j] to False
   b. Increment i by 1
   c. Update j by calculating (j + i) modulo n

8. Create a new list x that contains all elements in b that are True

9. If the length of x is 0 then:
   a. Print 'YES'
10. Else:
   a. Print 'NO'

11. End
```

### Assumptions
- The input value for n is a non-negative integer.
- The list b is indexed from 0 to n-1, with all initial values set to True.
- The operations for updating elements in list b and rotating the index j are valid based on list mechanics. 

### Explanation of Main Components
- **Variables**: n (input size), b (boolean list), j (index), and i (counter).
- **Loop**: A while loop that iterates until i exceeds 500,000.
- **Conditionals**: Check if the current index in list b is True before updating it.
- **List Comprehension**: Creates a new list x from b containing True values.
- **Final Conditional**: Checks the length of x to determine if the output should be 'YES' or 'NO'. 

### Readability
- Meaningful variable names help indicate their purpose.
- Clear steps illustrate the logic flow without ambiguity or technical jargon.
