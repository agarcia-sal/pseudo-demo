Certainly! Below is the high-level pseudocode that captures the functionality and logic of the provided code while adhering to your guidelines.

```
FUNCTION checkIfAllPositionsAreFalse(n)
    // Create a list of boolean values initialized to True
    INITIALIZE booleanList AS list of True with length n

    // Initialize necessary indices
    SET index AS 0
    SET step AS 1

    // Loop until the step exceeds 500000
    WHILE step <= 500000 DO
        // If the current index in the boolean list is True
        IF booleanList[index] IS True THEN
            // Set the current position to False
            SET booleanList[index] AS False
        END IF
        
        // Move to the next step
        INCREMENT step BY 1
        
        // Calculate the next index based on current index and step size
        SET index AS (index + step) MOD n
    END WHILE

    // Create a list of True positions remaining in the boolean list
    SET remainingTruePositions AS list of positions in booleanList where value is True
    
    // Check if there are no remaining True positions
    IF LENGTH(remainingTruePositions) IS 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES' // All positions are marked False
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO' // There are some positions still marked True
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. **Function Definition:** The function is named `checkIfAllPositionsAreFalse` and accepts an integer `n`, indicating the size of the boolean list.
2. **Boolean List Initialization:** A list of booleans (`booleanList`) is created and initialized to `True`.
3. **Index and Step Management:** Two variables are initialized for tracking the current index and the step increment.
4. **Main Loop:** The loop continues to execute until the step variable exceeds 500,000. Inside the loop:
    - If the current index points to a `True` value, it is changed to `False`.
    - The step is incremented.
    - The next index is calculated using the modulo operation.
5. **Collect Remaining True Values:** After the loop, a new list is created to find any locations that are still `True`.
6. **Final Check and Output:** If no `True` values remain, it prints "YES", otherwise, it prints "NO".

This pseudocode keeps the overall intent of the original code while using meaningful names and clear structural elements.
