Here is a clear and understandable pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```
BEGIN

    // Read an integer input which represents the size of a list.
    SET listSize = INPUT AS INTEGER

    // Create a boolean list initialized to True for all indices up to listSize.
    SET booleanList = LIST OF TRUE WITH LENGTH listSize

    // Initialize variables for iteration.
    SET currentIndex = 0
    SET increment = 1

    // Loop until increment reaches 500,000.
    WHILE (increment <= 500000) DO
        
        // Check if the current index in the boolean list is True.
        IF (booleanList[currentIndex] IS TRUE) THEN
            
            // Set the current index in the boolean list to False.
            SET booleanList[currentIndex] = FALSE
        
        // Increment the counter for the next iteration.
        INCREMENT increment BY 1
        
        // Calculate the next index by adding the increment and wrapping around the list using modulus.
        SET currentIndex = (currentIndex + increment) MOD listSize
    
    // Create a new list containing all the True values from the boolean list.
    SET remainingTrueValues = LIST OF ELEMENTS FROM booleanList WHERE ELEMENT IS TRUE
    
    // Check if there are any remaining True values.
    IF (LENGTH of remainingTrueValues IS 0) THEN
        
        // If no True values remain, print 'YES'.
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        
        // If there are still True values, print 'NO'.
        PRINT 'NO'

END
```

### Explanation:
1. The **boolean list** is initialized to True values, with a size based on user input.
2. A **while loop** runs as long as the increment is less than or equal to 500,000.
3. Inside the loop, there is a check to see if the current index of the boolean list is True, and if so, it sets that index to False.
4. It updates the current index for the next iteration, using a modular operation to ensure it wraps around to the start of the list if needed.
5. After the loop, it collects any remaining True values from the boolean list.
6. Finally, the program checks if there are any True values left and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
