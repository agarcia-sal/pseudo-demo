**Purpose:** The primary goal of this program is to determine if there are any `True` values remaining in a list after performing a specific process that alters the list based on a repeating pattern up to a maximum number. If no `True` values remain, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get Number of Elements:**
   - Read an integer value `n` that represents the number of elements in a list.

2. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a list `isActive` with `n` elements, all set to `True`, indicating that all elements are initially active.

3. **Set Initial Indices:**
   - Set an index variable `currentIndex` to 0 (pointing to the first element).
   - Set a step variable `step` to 1 to determine how many positions to skip in each iteration.

4. **Process the List:**
   - Repeat the following while `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - Check if the current element in `isActive` at `currentIndex` is `True`.
       - If it is `True`, mark this element as `False` (deactivate it).
     - Increment the `step` by 1 for the next iteration.
     - Update the `currentIndex` to the new position by adding the current `step` value to it, and wrap around using modulo `n` to stay within the bounds of the list.

5. **Check Remaining Active Elements:**
   - Create a new list `remainingActive` by filtering the `isActive` list, keeping only elements that are still `True`.

6. **Output Result:**
   - If the length of `remainingActive` is 0 (indicating no active elements left):
     - Print "YES".
   - Else:
     - Print "NO".

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The use of `isActive` indicates whether each position in the list is still active (`True`) or not (`False`).
- The `currentIndex` calculation ensures we loop through the list in a cyclic manner.
- The output message determines the status based on whether any `True` values remain after the process.

This pseudocode simplifies the logic by breaking down each major step into clear operations, making it easy to understand the flow without needing specific programming syntax.
