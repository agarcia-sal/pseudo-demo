**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start** by reading an integer input which represents a number called "totalCount".

2. **Create an array** named "booleanArray" of size "totalCount", initializing all values to True. This array will be used to track certain conditions.

3. **Initialize two variables**: 
   - Set a variable "incrementValue" to 1, which will be used to control the loop iterations.
   - Set a variable "index" to 0, which will be used to track the current position in the "booleanArray".

4. **Begin a loop** that continues as long as "incrementValue" is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - Check if the current position in the "booleanArray" (at "index") holds a value of True. If it does:
     - Change the value at that position (index) in "booleanArray" to False.
   - Increase "incrementValue" by 1.
   - Update "index" by adding "incrementValue" to it and taking the modulus with "totalCount" to ensure it wraps around if it exceeds the array's size.

5. **Create a new list** called "trueValues" which contains all the positions in "booleanArray" that are still True.

6. **Check the size of "trueValues"**:
   - If "trueValues" is empty (its length is 0):
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

**End** of the pseudocode.
