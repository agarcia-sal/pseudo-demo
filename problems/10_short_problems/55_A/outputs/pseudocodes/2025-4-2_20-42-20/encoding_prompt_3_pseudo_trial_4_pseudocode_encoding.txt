    IF (length of visibleList is equal to 0)

**Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

1. **Input Handling:** The program begins by accepting an integer input that represents the total number of positions to be analyzed.
   
2. **Boolean Array Initialization:** A boolean array is created to represent the visibility of each position, initially set to True.

3. **Looping Logic:** The main algorithm operates in a loop that runs 500,000 times. Within each iteration, the program checks if the current index in the boolean array is visible (True), and if so, it updates that position to not visible (False). It also updates the current index according to the step counter.

4. **Final Check for Visibility:** After the loop completes, the program checks if there are any True values remaining in the boolean array. If none remain, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO." 

This translated pseudocode conveys the main intent and logic of the original code without getting lost in specific syntax, making it easier for someone unfamiliar with programming languages to understand.
