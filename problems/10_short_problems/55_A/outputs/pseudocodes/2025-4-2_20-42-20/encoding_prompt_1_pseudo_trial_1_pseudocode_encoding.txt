**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize the Program:**
   - Read an integer value `n` from user input.

2. **Create a boolean list:**
   - Create a list named `isActive` with `n` elements, all initialized to `True`.

3. **Set initial positions:**
   - Set a variable `index` to 0 (this will track the current position in the list).
   - Set a variable `step` to 1 (this will determine how many steps to move after each iteration).

4. **Iterate through steps:**
   - Repeat the following while the `step` variable is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - Check if the current position in `isActive` at `index` is `True`:
       - If it is `True`, change that position in `isActive` to `False`.
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update the `index` to be the current `index` plus `step`, and use modulo `n` to wrap around if `index` exceeds `n`.

5. **Check remaining active positions:**
   - Create a new list `activePositions` which includes all elements from `isActive` that are still `True`.

6. **Determine the output:**
   - If the length of `activePositions` is 0 (meaning no `True` values are left):
     - Print "YES" (indicating that all positions have been deactivated).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating that there are still active positions).
