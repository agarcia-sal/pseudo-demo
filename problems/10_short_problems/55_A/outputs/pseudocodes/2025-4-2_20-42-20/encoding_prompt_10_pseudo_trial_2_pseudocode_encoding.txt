Here is the pseudocode translation following the prescribed steps:

```
1. Start

2. Input: Get an integer n from the user

3. Initialize an array b of size n with all values set to True

4. Initialize index j to 0
   Initialize step i to 1

5. While i is less than or equal to 500000 do:
   a. If b[j] is True then:
      i. Set b[j] to False
   b. Increment i by 1
   c. Update j to (j + i) modulo n

6. Create an array x to store elements from b that are still True

7. If the size of x is 0 then:
   a. Output "YES"
   else:
   b. Output "NO"

8. End
```

### Explanation of main components:
- **Input/Output:** The program inputs an integer and prints results based on the array values.
- **Array Initialization:** An array `b` is created to track boolean values.
- **Loop Structure:** A while loop is used to perform iterations until a specified number is reached.
- **Conditional Logic:** If statements check conditions and modify the state of the array.
- **Index Wrapping:** The modulo operation ensures that index `j` remains within bounds of the array.

### Assumptions:
- It is assumed that the input n is a positive integer.
- The array b is large enough to accommodate n elements without overflow.

### Clarity and Readability:
- Meaningful identifiers such as `n`, `b`, `j`, `i`, and `x` are used.
- Each action is simply described to facilitate understanding of the code flow.
