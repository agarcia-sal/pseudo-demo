**Pseudocode:**

1. Start the program by receiving an integer input named "number_of_elements", which indicates how many items will be represented in a list.

2. Create a list called "flags" with "number_of_elements" entries, all initially set to True. This list will be used to track a specific condition for each element.

3. Initialize two variables: 
   - "index" set to 0, which will represent the current position in the "flags" list.
   - "counter" set to 1, which will control the number of iterations.

4. Enter a loop that will continue as long as "counter" is less than or equal to 500,000.
   - Within the loop:
     - If the current entry in "flags" at position "index" is True:
       - Set that entry to False, indicating that a certain condition has been met and that entry is now no longer valid.
     - Increment "counter" by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.
     - Update "index" by adding "counter" to it and taking the remainder when divided by "number_of_elements". This ensures "index" wraps around if it exceeds the size of the "flags" list.

5. After exiting the loop, create a new list called "active_flags" that includes only the entries from "flags" that are still True. This list represents the elements that have not been marked False.

6. Check the length of the "active_flags" list:
   - If it is empty (meaning all entries in "flags" were set to False), then output "YES".
   - If it contains any entries (meaning some entries in "flags" remain True), then output "NO".

7. End the program.
