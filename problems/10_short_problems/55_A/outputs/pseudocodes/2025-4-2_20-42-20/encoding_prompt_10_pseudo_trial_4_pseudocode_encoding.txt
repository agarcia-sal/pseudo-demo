Here is the pseudocode translated from the given code, adhering to the steps provided:

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Input the number n
    SET n AS INTEGER
    INPUT n

    // Step 2: Initialize a list b with TRUE values
    SET b AS ARRAY OF BOOLEAN OF SIZE n
    FOR i FROM 0 TO n - 1 DO
        SET b[i] = TRUE
    END FOR

    // Step 3: Initialize loop control variables
    SET j = 0
    SET i = 1

    // Step 4: Main loop to update the list b
    WHILE (i <= 500000) DO
        // Step 5: Check if current position j is marked TRUE
        IF (b[j] IS TRUE) THEN
            SET b[j] = FALSE
        END IF

        // Step 6: Increment i and update j for the next iteration
        INCREMENT i BY 1
        SET j = (j + i) MOD n
    END WHILE
    
    // Step 7: Create a list x with all TRUE values from list b
    SET x AS ARRAY OF BOOLEAN FROM b WHERE ELEMENT IS TRUE

    // Step 8: Check if list x is empty
    IF (LENGTH OF x IS 0) THEN
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'
    END IF
    
END
```

### Clarifications and Assumptions:
1. **Data Types**: It is assumed that `n` is a positive integer and that the array `b` has a size equal to `n`.
2. **Loop boundaries**: The loop runs until `i` exceeds 500,000, which seems to be constrained based on the original codeâ€™s intent. 
3. **Conditionals**: The conditionals and loop structures follow typical programming control flow.
4. **Meaningful Identifiers**: Variables like `n`, `b`, `x`, `j`, and `i` are used consistently to indicate their function clearly.
