**Purpose**: The code determines whether all elements in a list can eventually be marked as 'False' based on a specific pattern of iteration, and it outputs either "YES" or "NO" depending on whether any 'True' values remain.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Read an integer value `n` from user input.
   - Create a list `b` of size `n` and fill it with 'True' values.
   - Set `j` to 0 (this will track the index in the list).
   - Set `i` to 1 (this will track the steps taken).

2. **Iterate to Mark Values**:
   - While `i` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - Check if the current index `j` in list `b` is 'True':
       - If it is 'True', mark the value at index `j` as 'False'.
     - Increment `i` by 1.
     - Update index `j` to be the sum of `j` and `i`, then take that sum modulo `n` to wrap around if necessary.

3. **Check Remaining True Values**:
   - Create a new list `x` that contains only the 'True' values from list `b`.
   - If the length of `x` is 0 (indicating no 'True' values remain):
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

**Comments**:
- The list `b` acts as a flag list, where 'True' indicates an unmarked position, and 'False' indicates a marked position.
- The iterative marking process checks each position based on a calculated index that changes with each step, ensuring a pattern of marking.

This pseudocode effectively summarizes the logic and flow of the original code while remaining clear and accessible.
