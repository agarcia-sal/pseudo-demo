**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Read an integer from user input
    SET n TO Read an integer from input

    // Step 2: Initialize a list 'b' with 'n' elements, all set to True
    INITIALIZE list b WITH True for each index from 0 to n-1

    // Step 3: Initialize variables
    SET j TO 0        // j is the current index in the list
    SET i TO 1        // i is the step counter

    // Step 4: Loop until i exceeds 500000
    WHILE (i <= 500000) DO

        // Step 5: Check if the current index in list 'b' is True
        IF (b[j] IS True) THEN
            // Step 6: Set the current index to False
            SET b[j] TO False
        END IF

        // Step 7: Increment i by 1
        INCREMENT i

        // Step 8: Update j to wrap around within bounds of 'n'
        SET j TO (j + i) MOD n
    END WHILE

    // Step 9: Create a list 'x' of elements in 'b' that are still True
    INITIALIZE list x WITH elements of b that are True

    // Step 10: Check the length of list 'x'
    IF (length of x IS 0) THEN
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'
    END IF

END
```

### Assumptions:
1. The input 'n' is a positive integer.
2. The list 'b' is effectively a Boolean array, where initial values are set to True.
3. The list 'x' is derived from 'b', checking for elements that remain True after the loop execution.
4. The operations involving list indexing and mathematical operations assume that Python-like semantics are followed for handling arrays and modulo calculations.
