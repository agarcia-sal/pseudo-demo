**Purpose Summary:** 
The goal of this code is to determine whether a specific condition is met based on a list that represents boolean values. If all values in the list are marked as "used" (False), then the output will be "YES"; otherwise, it will be "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
START

// Accept user input for the number of boolean values
SET numberOfValues TO integer input from user

// Create a list of boolean values initialized to True
INITIALIZE booleanList AS a list of True values with size numberOfValues

// Initialize control variables
SET index TO 0
SET step TO 1

// Begin loop that operates until step exceeds 500,000
WHILE step is less than or equal to 500,000 DO
    // If the current position in the list is still marked as True
    IF booleanList at index is True THEN
        // Mark the current position as False (used)
        SET booleanList at index TO False
    END IF
    
    // Increment step to move to the next position
    INCREMENT step by 1
    
    // Calculate the next index to check using the current step and wrap around using modulo
    SET index TO (index + step) modulo numberOfValues
END WHILE

// Filter out the booleanList to find any remaining True values
SET remainingTrueValues AS a list of True values from booleanList

// Check if there are no True values left
IF length of remainingTrueValues is 0 THEN
    // If no True values are left, print "YES"
    PRINT "YES"
ELSE
    // If there are True values left, print "NO"
    PRINT "NO"
END IF

END
```

### Comments for Clarity:
- The booleanList is used to track which positions have been marked as "used" (False).
- The index variable determines the current position we are inspecting and modifying in the list.
- The step variable controls how we skip through the list, with its value increasing incrementally to create a pattern of indices we check.
- Finally, the program checks if all values in the booleanList are marked as False and responds with "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Output:
- The output will be either "YES" if all positions in the list are marked as False, indicating that a certain condition is fulfilled, or "NO" if there are any remaining True values.
