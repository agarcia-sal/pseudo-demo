Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that translates the provided Python code into a clear and structured format, following your guided steps:

```plaintext
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Initialize variable
    SET n TO INTEGER VALUE OF user input

    // Step 2: Create a list 'b' of Boolean values initialized to True
    INITIALIZE b AS LIST OF TRUE VALUES OF LENGTH n

    // Step 3: Initialize counters
    SET j TO 0
    SET i TO 1

    // Step 4: Loop while 'i' is less than or equal to 500000
    WHILE (i <= 500000) DO

        // Step 5: Check if the current position 'j' is still True
        IF (b[j] IS TRUE) THEN
            SET b[j] TO FALSE // Mark the position as False

        // Increment 'i' and update 'j' for the next iteration
        INCREMENT i BY 1
        SET j TO (j + i) MOD n // Update 'j' using modular arithmetic

    END WHILE

    // Step 6: Create list 'x' to store positions in 'b' that are still True
    SET x AS LIST OF ALL ELEMENTS IN b WHERE ELEMENT IS TRUE

    // Step 7: Check the length of 'x'
    IF (LENGTH OF x EQUALS 0) THEN
        OUTPUT 'YES' // All values have been marked False
    ELSE
        OUTPUT 'NO' // There are still True values in 'b'
    END IF

END
```

### Assumptions:
- **Input**: It is assumed that `n` will be a non-negative integer.
- **Data Types**: The list `b` is assumed to store Boolean values, and `x` is derived from this list.
- **Loop Condition**: The upper limit of `i` (i.e., 500000) is a constant defined for execution purposes.

### Explanation of Main Components:
- **Initialization**: The process starts by reading an input integer.
- **Boolean List**: A list that tracks state using Boolean values.
- **Looping Structure**: While loop iterates a set number of times, updating the list based on the index computations.
- **Conditional Statements**: Used to check for values in the list and control the program flow based on the results.
- **Output**: Final conditional checks provide a status message indicating whether any values remain True.
