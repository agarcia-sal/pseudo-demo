**Purpose:** The objective of this algorithm is to determine whether all positions in a list can be marked as false based on a specific counting mechanism. If all positions are marked false, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read an integer called `size` from the user, which indicates the number of positions.

3. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a list called `positions` containing `size` elements, all set to `True`. This represents the status of each position (True means unmarked, False means marked).

4. **Set Counters:**
   - Initialize a counter called `current_increment` to 1.
   - Initialize another counter called `current_position_index` to 0.

5. **Mark Positions:**
   - While `current_increment` is less than or equal to 500,000, do the following:
     - If `positions[current_position_index]` is `True`, set `positions[current_position_index]` to `False`.
     - Increment `current_increment` by 1.
     - Update `current_position_index` to be the sum of `current_position_index` and `current_increment`, then find the index within the bounds of the list size using modulo operation.

6. **Check Status of Positions:**
   - Create a new list called `unmarked_positions` containing only the `True` values from the `positions` list.

7. **Output Result:**
   - If the length of `unmarked_positions` is 0, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

8. **End**

This pseudocode maintains clarity and concise flow while ensuring that the logical operations correspond closely with the original code's structure and purpose. Each step is broken down to promote understanding and reflect careful consideration of the algorithm's sequence of operations.
