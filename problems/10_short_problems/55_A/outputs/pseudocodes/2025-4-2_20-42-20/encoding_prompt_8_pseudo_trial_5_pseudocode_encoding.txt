**Purpose**: The goal of the code is to determine whether certain conditions hold true after a series of iterations involving an array, ultimately printing "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start Program**:
   - Read a number from user input and store it in a variable named `number_of_elements`.

2. **Initialize**:
   - Create a list named `boolean_list` with a size of `number_of_elements`, and set all elements to `True`.
   - Set two variables: `pointer` to 0 and `index` to 1.

3. **Loop**:
   - Repeat the following steps while `index` is less than or equal to 500000:
     - If the current element at `pointer` in `boolean_list` is `True`:
       - Set the current element in `boolean_list` at `pointer` to `False`.
     - Increment `index` by 1.
     - Update `pointer` by calculating the new position as `(pointer + index) modulo number_of_elements`.

4. **Filter Active Elements**:
   - Create a new list named `active_elements` that contains all elements from `boolean_list` which are still `True`.

5. **Check Result**:
   - If the length of `active_elements` is 0:
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

**Comments**:
- The main loop modifies the `boolean_list` based on specific conditions and uses a mathematical approach to adjust the position within the list. 
- The final check ensures that if no elements remain `True`, it indicates a certain condition was satisfied, leading to the output "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". 

This pseudocode clearly describes the logic in a structured manner without relying on specific programming syntax, focusing on clarity and understanding.
