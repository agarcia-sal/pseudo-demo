**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to determine whether there is any unmarked position in a list after a series of marking operations based on a specific pattern.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start of Program**

2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read a number `total_positions` from the user to determine the size of the list.

3. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a list called `positions` with `total_positions` entries, all set to `True`. 
     - Each entry represents that the position is initially unmarked.

4. **Set Initial Indices:**
   - Set `current_index` to 0.
   - Set `step` to 1.

5. **Iterate through Marking Process:**
   - While `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the value at `positions[current_index]` is `True` (meaning the position is unmarked):
       - Mark `positions[current_index]` as `False` (meaning the position is now marked).
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update `current_index` to the next position:
       - Calculate the next position using the formula `(current_index + step) modulo total_positions`.
       
6. **Check for Unmarked Positions:**
   - Create a list called `remaining_unmarked` that contains all entries in `positions` that are still `True` (unmarked).

7. **Determine Result:**
   - If `remaining_unmarked` is empty (meaning all positions were marked):
     - Print "YES" (indicating no unmarked positions remain).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating there are still unmarked positions).

8. **End of Program**

This pseudocode abstracts the original logic while keeping the essential steps and flow clear and understandable for readers who may not be familiar with the specific programming language used.
