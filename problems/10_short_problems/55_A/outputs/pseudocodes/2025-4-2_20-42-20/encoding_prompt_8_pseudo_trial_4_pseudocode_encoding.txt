**Purpose:** The goal of this code is to determine if all positions in a list can eventually be marked as 'False' based on a specified pattern, and it outputs 'YES' if all positions are marked, or 'NO' otherwise.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Get input**
   - Read a number `n` from the user, which represents the size of a list.

2. **Initialize a boolean list**
   - Create a list `positions` of size `n` where each element is set to `True`. This list will keep track of positions that have not been marked.

3. **Index variables**
   - Set variable `currentIndex` to 0. This variable will be used to track the current position being processed.
   - Set variable `step` to 1. This variable will determine how far to move in the list during each iteration.

4. **Loop through positions**
   - While the value of `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - Check if the current position at `currentIndex` in the list `positions` is `True`.
       - If it is `True`:
         - Set the position at `currentIndex` to `False`, indicating it has been marked.

     - Increase `step` by 1 to change the movement.
     - Update `currentIndex` to the next position calculated by `(currentIndex + step) modulo n`. This ensures the index wraps around if it exceeds the list size.

5. **Check for unmarked positions**
   - Create a list `unmarkedPositions` containing all elements from `positions` that are still `True`.

6. **Output the result**
   - If the length of the list `unmarkedPositions` is zero (meaning all positions have been marked):
     - Print 'YES'.
   - Otherwise:
     - Print 'NO'.

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The loop runs a maximum of 500,000 iterations, potentially marking positions in the list according to a specific jumping pattern based on the increasing step size.
- The modulo operation ensures that if we reach the end of the list during indexing, we start from the beginning again.

**Example Structure:**
```plaintext
Begin
    Read n
    Create positions list with n True values
    Set currentIndex = 0
    Set step = 1
    
    While step <= 500000 do
        If positions[currentIndex] is True then
            Set positions[currentIndex] to False
        Increment step by 1
        Update currentIndex to (currentIndex + step) modulo n
    
    Create unmarkedPositions containing all True in positions
    
    If length of unmarkedPositions is 0 then
        Print 'YES'
    Else
        Print 'NO'
End
```
