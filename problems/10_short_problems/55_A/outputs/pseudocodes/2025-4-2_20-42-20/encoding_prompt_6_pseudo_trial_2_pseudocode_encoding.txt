Here is the pseudocode representation of the provided code, capturing its logic and operations in a clear and understandable form:

```
BEGIN PROGRAM

    // Read an integer input representing the size of the array
    SET sizeOfArray TO GET_INPUT()
    
    // Initialize a boolean array with 'sizeOfArray' elements, all set to True
    CREATE booleanArray OF SIZE sizeOfArray AND SET ALL ELEMENTS TO True
    
    // Initialize two variables for tracking the current state
    SET indexToUpdate TO 0
    SET stepCount TO 1
    
    // Continue the loop while stepCount is less than or equal to 500,000
    WHILE stepCount IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 500000 DO
        
        // Check if the current position in the boolean array is True
        IF booleanArray[indexToUpdate] IS True THEN
            
            // Set the current position to False, indicating it has been processed
            SET booleanArray[indexToUpdate] TO False
        
        // Increment the step count
        INCREMENT stepCount BY 1
        
        // Update the index to the next position in the array using modulo operation
        SET indexToUpdate TO (indexToUpdate + stepCount) MOD sizeOfArray
    
    END WHILE
    
    // Create a new list that contains all elements from booleanArray that are still True
    CREATE filteredList AS A LIST OF ELEMENTS IN booleanArray WHERE ELEMENT IS True
    
    // Check if the filtered list is empty
    IF LENGTH(filteredList) IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
        
        // If the filtered list is empty, output "YES"
        PRINT "YES"
        
    ELSE
        
        // If the filtered list is not empty, output "NO"
        PRINT "NO"
    
    END IF

END PROGRAM
```

### Summary of the Pseudocode:

1. The program initializes a boolean array based on the input size.
2. It iterates, marking indices in the array as False according to a specific counting rule until a certain limit is reached.
3. After processing, it checks if any elements in the array remain True.
4. It outputs "YES" if all elements are marked False; otherwise, it outputs "NO". 

This pseudocode remains high-level while clearly articulating the program's flow and logic without getting bogged down in technical specifics.
