**Summary of Purpose**: The code determines whether all elements in a list, initialized to `True`, become `False` based on a specific iterative process. If any element remains `True`, it outputs "NO"; otherwise, it outputs "YES".

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Initialize**:
    - Read an integer value, `n`, which represents the size of a list.
    - Create a list called `isMarked`, with `n` elements all set to `True`.

2. **Set Up Iteration Variables**:
    - Set `index` to 0.
    - Set `counter` to 1.

3. **Iterate While Counter is Less Than or Equal to 500,000**:
    - If `isMarked[index]` is `True`:
        - Change `isMarked[index]` to `False` (mark this index as processed).
    - Increase `counter` by 1.
    - Update `index` to be the new position, calculated as `(index + counter) mod n` (wrap around if necessary).

4. **Check Remaining Unmarked Elements**:
    - Create a new list called `remainingTrue` containing all elements of `isMarked` that are still `True`.

5. **Output Results**:
    - If `remainingTrue` is empty (meaning all elements were marked `False`):
        - Print "YES".
    - Otherwise, print "NO".

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The list `isMarked` serves as a flag to track whether an index has been "visited."
- The loop continues to process indices based on a growing `counter`, ensuring that an increasing step size is accounted for in each iteration.
- The final check determines if any flags remain unmarked, translating to a "YES" if all have been processed, or "NO" if at least one remains active.

By breaking down the logic in this way, it should be accessible for readers unfamiliar with the original code or programming syntax.
