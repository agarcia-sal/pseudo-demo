**Purpose:** The goal of this program is to determine if there are any `True` values left in a list after a series of operations. If there are no `True` values remaining, the program outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
   
2. **Initialize Input**
   - Accept an integer input for the size of a list (let's call it `listSize`).
   
3. **Create a List**
   - Create a list called `statusList` with `listSize` elements, all initially set to `True`.
   
4. **Set Up Variables**
   - Set a variable `indexPosition` to 0.
   - Set a variable `incrementValue` to 1.

5. **Loop Operations**
   - While the variable `incrementValue` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     1. Check if the element at `indexPosition` in `statusList` is `True`.
        - If it is `True`, change it to `False` (indicating it has been processed).
     2. Increase `incrementValue` by 1.
     3. Update `indexPosition` by adding `incrementValue` to it and taking the remainder when divided by `listSize` (this ensures `indexPosition` wraps around the list if it goes out of bounds).

6. **Check for Remaining True Values**
   - Create a new list called `remainingTrue` that includes all elements from `statusList` that are still `True`.
   
7. **Output Result**
   - If the length of `remainingTrue` is 0 (indicating no `True` values remain):
     - Print "YES" (all values have been processed).
   - Otherwise, print "NO" (some values are still `True`).

8. **End**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The list `statusList` keeps track of whether each position is still available (True) or has been processed (False).
- The looping condition ensures that a large number of operations can be performed, but the index wraps around to maintain the list's bounds.

This pseudocode effectively communicates the logic behind the original code in a clear and accessible manner, allowing readers to understand its structure and functionality without specific programming knowledge.
