Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that translates the provided code into a clear and understandable format:

```plaintext
START

// Step 1: Receive input value for n
SET numberOfElements TO integer input

// Step 2: Initialize a boolean list to track elements
CREATE a list 'isActive' of size numberOfElements with all values set to True

// Step 3: Initialize index variables for the loop
SET index TO 0
SET increment TO 1

// Step 4: Loop through numbers while the increment value is less than or equal to 500,000
WHILE increment is less than or equal to 500,000 DO
    // Step 5: Check if the current index in the boolean list is active
    IF isActive[index] is True THEN
        // Step 6: Mark the current index as inactive
        SET isActive[index] TO False
    END IF
    
    // Step 7: Move to the next increment
    INCREMENT increment by 1
    
    // Step 8: Update the index based on the current increment while ensuring it wraps around
    SET index TO (index + increment) MOD numberOfElements
END WHILE

// Step 9: Create a list of active elements from the boolean list
CREATE a list 'activeElements' containing all indices from isActive that are still True

// Step 10: Check if there are active elements left
IF SIZE OF activeElements is 0 THEN
    // Step 11: If no active elements, output 'YES'
    PRINT 'YES'
ELSE
    // Step 12: Otherwise, output 'NO'
    PRINT 'NO'
END IF

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. The code starts by taking an integer input `n`, which represents the size of a boolean list.
2. It initializes a list called `isActive` to keep track of whether each of the `n` indices is active (True).
3. The algorithm proceeds with a loop that runs while the incrementing variable `increment` is less than or equal to 500,000.
4. Inside the loop, it marks the current index as inactive (False) if it is still active, updates the index for the next iteration, and increments the increment variable.
5. After the loop completes, it collects all indices from `isActive` that are still active and checks if any are left.
6. Depending on the presence of active elements, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'.

This pseudocode abstracts away the specific programming language syntax while effectively capturing the logic and structure of the original code.
