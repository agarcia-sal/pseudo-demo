**Purpose Summary**: The code determines whether all values in a list can be marked as "False" through a specific process, returning "YES" if successful, and "NO" otherwise.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start the program**.
2. **Get user input**: 
   - Read an integer named totalCount from the user. 

3. **Initialize the list**:
   - Create a list called isMarked with totalCount entries, all set to True.
  
4. **Set counters**:
   - Set a counter named currentStep to 1.
   - Set a counter named index to 0.
  
5. **Processing loop**:
   - While currentStep is less than or equal to 500000:
     - If isMarked at index is True:
       - Set isMarked at index to False (mark this position as processed).
     - Increment currentStep by 1.
     - Update index to (index + currentStep) modulo totalCount (wrap around to the beginning of the list if needed).

6. **Check results**:
   - Create a new list called remainingTrue containing only the entries from isMarked that are still True.
  
7. **Determine output**:
   - If remainingTrue is empty (length is 0):
     - Output "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Output "NO".

8. **End the program**. 

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The process involves marking positions in the list based on a mathematical sequence and checks if any position remains True (unmarked).
- The use of modulo ensures the process continues in a circular manner within the bounds of the list.
