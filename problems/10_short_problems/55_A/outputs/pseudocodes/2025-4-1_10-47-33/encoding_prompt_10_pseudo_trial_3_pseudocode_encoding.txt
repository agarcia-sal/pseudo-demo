Certainly! Here's the pseudocode based on the provided code, organized and clarified according to the guided steps:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Input the size of the array
    SET n TO integer(INPUT("Enter an integer value:"))
    
    // Step 2: Initialize an array (list) with True values
    INITIALIZE b AS list of Boolean values of size n, ALL set to True
    
    // Step 3: Initialize variables for looping
    SET j TO 0
    SET i TO 1
    
    // Step 4: Loop to process values while i is less than or equal to 500000
    WHILE (i <= 500000) DO
        // If the current position j in the list b is True
        IF (b[j] == True) THEN
            SET b[j] TO False  // Mark position j as False
        
        INCREMENT i BY 1        // Move to the next value
        SET j TO (j + i) MOD n  // Update position j using modulo operation to wrap around
    
    // Step 5: Create a new list x containing only True values from b
    SET x TO a new list containing all elements a FROM b WHERE a == True
    
    // Step 6: Check if the list x is empty and print the result
    IF (length of x == 0) THEN
        PRINT "YES"  // No True values left in b
    ELSE
        PRINT "NO"   // There are still True values in b

END
```

### Assumptions:
1. It is assumed that the input for `n` is a non-negative integer.
2. The length function `length` computes the number of elements in the list.
3. The `MOD` operator returns the remainder of division, allowing `j` to wrap around valid indices of the list `b`.

### Clarity:
The pseudocode specifies each action clearly and maintains readability, with meaningful variable assignments and operations that describe the algorithm's intent.
