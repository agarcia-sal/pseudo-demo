**Pseudocode Translation:**

1. **Start**
 
2. **Input:**
   - Read an integer value `n`, which represents the size of an array (or list).

3. **Initialize:**
   - Create a list called `is_available` with `n` elements, all set to `True`. This list will be used to track the availability of each position.
   - Set the variable `current_position` to 0, which will serve as the index to access the list.
   - Set the variable `increment` to 1, which represents the current step size that will determine how we move through the list.

4. **Processing Loop:**
   - While `increment` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - Check if `is_available` at the index `current_position` is `True`:
       - If yes, set `is_available` at that index to `False`.
     - Increase the `increment` by 1 to prepare for the next step.
     - Update the `current_position` by adding `increment` to it, then take the modulus of `n` to ensure the position wraps around if it exceeds the list size.

5. **Identify Unavailable Positions:**
   - Create a list called `available_positions` containing all the elements from `is_available` that are still `True`.

6. **Output:**
   - If the length of the `available_positions` list is equal to 0 (meaning no positions are available):
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO".

7. **End** 

This pseudocode captures the main logic and flow of the original code while abstracting away the specific programming syntax.
