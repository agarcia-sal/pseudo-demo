Here is the pseudocode that captures the logic and intent of the provided code snippet:

```
START

1. DEFINE an integer variable `numberOfElements` and SET it to the input value
2. CREATE a list `isActive` initialized with `True` values of size `numberOfElements`
3. INITIALIZE variables `index` to 0 and `step` to 1

4. WHILE `step` is less than or equal to 500000 DO
    a. IF `isActive[index]` is `True` THEN
        i. SET `isActive[index]` to `False` (mark the index as inactive)
    b. INCREMENT `step` by 1
    c. UPDATE `index` to (current `index` + `step`) MOD `numberOfElements` (calculate the new active index)
END WHILE

5. CREATE a list `activeElements` containing all elements in `isActive` that are still `True`

6. IF the length of `activeElements` is 0 THEN
    a. PRINT 'YES' (indicating no active elements remaining)
ELSE
    a. PRINT 'NO' (indicating there are active elements remaining)
END IF

END
```

### Explanation:

- The pseudocode begins by defining the input requirements and initializing necessary data structures.
- It marks positions in the list `isActive` as `False` based on a specified logic that involves stepping through the list.
- After processing, it checks for any remaining `True` values to determine the output, demonstrating clear logic flows through conditional statements and iterations.
