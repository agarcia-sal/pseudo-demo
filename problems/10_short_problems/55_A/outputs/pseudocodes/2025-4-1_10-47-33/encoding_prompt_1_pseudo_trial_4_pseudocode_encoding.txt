**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input**: Read an integer `n` from the user, which represents the size of the array.
2. **Initialize**: Create a boolean array `isTrue` of size `n`, where all elements are set to True. This will track the status of each index.
3. **Set initial variables**: 
   - Set `currentIndex` to 0
   - Set `increment` to 1
4. **Loop**: While `increment` is less than or equal to 500000:
   - If `isTrue[currentIndex]` is True:
     - Set `isTrue[currentIndex]` to False (mark it as processed)
   - Increment `increment` by 1
   - Update `currentIndex` to be the sum of `currentIndex` and `increment`, taken modulo `n` (this wraps around the array if it exceeds the bounds).
5. **Check results**: Create a list `remainingTrue` containing all elements of `isTrue` that are still True (not processed).
6. **Output**:
   - If the length of `remainingTrue` is 0, print "YES" (indicating all elements were processed).
   - Otherwise, print "NO" (indicating there are elements that remain True).
