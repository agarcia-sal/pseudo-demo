**Purpose:** The code determines if there exists any `True` values in a list after performing a series of operations, outputting "YES" if none are left, and "NO" if at least one remains.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:** 
   - Get a number from the user, called totalNumbers.

2. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a list called statusList with totalNumbers entries, all starting as True. 

3. **Set Initial Indices:**
   - Set a variable currentIndex to 0.
   - Set another variable step to 1.

4. **Loop Until Limit Reached:**
   - While step is less than or equal to 500000 do the following:
     a. If the value at statusList[currentIndex] is True,
        - Change statusList[currentIndex] to False.
     b. Increase step by 1.
     c. Update currentIndex to be the remainder of (currentIndex + step) divided by totalNumbers.

5. **Check Remaining True Values:**
   - Create a list called remainingTrueValues that contains all elements from statusList that are still True.

6. **Output Result:**
   - If the length of remainingTrueValues is 0 (meaning there are no True values left),
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise,
     - Print "NO".

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The statusList keeps track of whether numbers are marked False as the loop progresses.
- The algorithm simulates marking numbers in a circular way based on increasing step values.
- The final check evaluates if there are any numbers that are still marked as True.

This pseudocode captures the logic and core operations of the original code while making it more accessible and understandable to readers not familiar with programming syntax.
