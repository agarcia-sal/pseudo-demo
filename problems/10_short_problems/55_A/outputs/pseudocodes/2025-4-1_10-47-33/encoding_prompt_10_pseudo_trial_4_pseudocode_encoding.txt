Here is the pseudocode based on the given code, following the structured language concepts as instructed:

```
BEGIN

    // Step 1: Input Handling
    SET n TO INTEGER(INPUT())
    
    // Step 2: Initialize a boolean list b
    INITIALIZE b AS LIST OF BOOLEAN WITH SIZE n AND ALL VALUES SET TO TRUE
    SET j TO 0
    SET i TO 1

    // Step 3: Loop to modify the boolean list
    WHILE i IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 500000 DO
        IF b[j] IS TRUE THEN
            SET b[j] TO FALSE
        END IF
        
        // Step 4: Increment i and update j
        INCREMENT i BY 1
        SET j TO (j + i) MOD n
    END WHILE

    // Step 5: Extract remaining TRUE values from b
    SET x AS LIST OF BOOLEAN CONTAINING ELEMENTS FROM b WHERE ELEMENT IS TRUE

    // Step 6: Check the result and print output
    IF LENGTH OF x IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation of Components:
1. **Input Handling:** It accepts an integer input which dictates the size of the boolean list.
2. **Initialization:** A boolean list is created and initialized with TRUE values.
3. **Loop:** It iteratively marks positions in the list as FALSE based on the computed index derived from the loop control variable.
4. **List Filtering:** Remaining TRUE values are filtered into another list.
5. **Conditional Check:** It checks if the filtered list is empty and prints the corresponding output.

### Assumptions:
- The input value `n` is assumed to be a positive integer.
- The list `b` is created with enough space to accommodate `n` elements.
- The output is printed based on the evaluation of the boolean list after processing.
