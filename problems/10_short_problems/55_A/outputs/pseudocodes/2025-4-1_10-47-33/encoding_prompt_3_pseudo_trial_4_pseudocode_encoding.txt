### Explanation:
1. The pseudocode begins by setting up to read an integer which determines the size of a list.
2. A list called `statusList` is created with all elements initialized to True.
3. Two counters are initialized, one for iterating up to 500,000 and the other for tracking the current index in the list.
4. A loop runs to modify the `statusList`, specifically setting certain elements to False based on a combination of the index and outer counter.
5. After the loop, the code filters out the remaining True elements and checks if any are left.
6. Finally, it outputs 'YES' if there are no True elements; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. 

This structured presentation clarifies the logical flow, making it easier to understand the intent behind the original code.
