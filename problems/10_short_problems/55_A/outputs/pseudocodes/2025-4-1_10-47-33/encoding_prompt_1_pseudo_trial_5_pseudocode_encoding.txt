### Pseudocode

1. **Input** the integer value representing the number of elements (n).
2. **Initialize** a list (b) of size n with all values set to True.
3. **Set** index variable j to 0.
4. **Set** counter variable i to 1.
5. **While** i is less than or equal to 500000, do the following:
    - **If** the value at index j in list b is True:
        - Set the value at index j in list b to False.
    - **Increment** the counter variable i by 1.
    - **Update** the index j to be the remainder of (j + i) divided by n.
6. **Create** a new list (x) that contains all values from list b that are still True.
7. **If** the length of list x is equal to 0:
    - **Output** "YES".
8. **Otherwise**:
    - **Output** "NO".
