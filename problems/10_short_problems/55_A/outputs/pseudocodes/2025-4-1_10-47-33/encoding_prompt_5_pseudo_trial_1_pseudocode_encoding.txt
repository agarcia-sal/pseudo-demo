**Purpose:** The program determines whether all elements in a boolean list, initialized to true, can be marked as false through a specific marking process. If all elements are marked false, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
1. Start the program.
2. Get a number 'n' from the user which indicates the size of the list.
3. Initialize a list 'booleanList' with 'n' elements all set to TRUE.
4. Set variable 'index' to 0.
5. Set variable 'increment' to 1.

6. WHILE increment is less than or equal to 500000 DO:
    a. IF booleanList at position 'index' is TRUE THEN:
        i. Set booleanList at position 'index' to FALSE.
    b. Increase increment by 1.
    c. Update index to (index + increment) modulo n to wrap around if it exceeds n.

7. Create a new list 'remainingTrue' that contains all TRUE values from booleanList.
8. IF the length of remainingTrue is 0 THEN:
    a. PRINT "YES"
9. ELSE:
    a. PRINT "NO"

10. End the program.
```

**Comments for Clarity:**

- The program starts by asking the user for the size of the boolean list.
- It creates a list where all values are set to TRUE, indicating they are initially unmarked.
- The while loop progresses, marking entries in the list as FALSE based on a sequential increment and wraps around using modulo operation.
- After the marking process, the program checks if there are any TRUE entries left in the list.
- The output reflects whether all entries have been successfully marked as FALSE.
