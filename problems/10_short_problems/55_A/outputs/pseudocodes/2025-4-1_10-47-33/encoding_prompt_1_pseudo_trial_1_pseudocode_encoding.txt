**Pseudocode:**

1. Initialize the variable `numberOfElements` as the user input converted to an integer.
2. Create a list `isIncluded` of boolean values, with each entry set to `True`, with a length equal to `numberOfElements`.
3. Set the variable `currentIndex` to 0.
4. Set the variable `increment` to 1.

5. While `increment` is less than or equal to 500000, do the following:
   - If the value at `isIncluded[currentIndex]` is `True`, then set it to `False`.
   - Increment `increment` by 1.
   - Update `currentIndex` to the new position using the formula `(currentIndex + increment) modulo numberOfElements`.

6. Create a list `trueValues` by filtering the `isIncluded` list for values that are still `True`.

7. If the length of `trueValues` is equal to 0, then:
   - Output "YES"
   Else:
   - Output "NO"  

**Summary of Logic:**
- The algorithm initializes a list indicating the inclusion status of each index, iteratively marking some indices as `False` based on a specific counting mechanism.
- Finally, it checks if any indices remain `True` and produces an output based on that condition. If all indices are marked `False`, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
