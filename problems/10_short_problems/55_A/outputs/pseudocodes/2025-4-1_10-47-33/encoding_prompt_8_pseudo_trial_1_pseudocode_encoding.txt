**Objective:** The primary goal of this code is to determine if all elements within a certain range become "marked" based on a specific iterative marking process, ultimately outputting either "YES" if all are marked or "NO" if any remain unmarked.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Get Input:**
   - Read an integer value `n` from the user, which represents the size of a list.

3. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a list called `IsMarked` of size `n`, where all elements are initially set to `True` (this indicates that all items are unmarked).

4. **Initialize Counters:**
   - Set a variable `currentIndex` to `0` (this keeps track of which index in the list is being operated on).
   - Set a variable `increment` to `1` (this is the step size for marking the list).

5. **Marking Process:**
   - While `increment` is less than or equal to `500000`:
     - If the current item in `IsMarked` at `currentIndex` is still marked as `True`:
       - Change the value at `IsMarked[currentIndex]` to `False` (mark this item as processed).
     - Increment `increment` by `1` (increase the step for the next operation).
     - Update `currentIndex` to the new position calculated by `(currentIndex + increment) mod n` (wrap around if the index exceeds the list size).

6. **Check for Unmarked Items:**
   - Create a new list called `UnmarkedItems` that contains all the items from `IsMarked` that are still `True` (indicating they are unmarked).

7. **Output Result:**
   - If the length of `UnmarkedItems` is `0` (all items are marked):
     - Print 'YES'
   - Otherwise:
     - Print 'NO'

8. **End Program**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The approach uses a marking system where the current index is updated in a wrapping manner, making sure it never exceeds the bounds of the list size.
- The final step checks whether any items remain marked (unmarked) after the marking process and provides output based on that result.
