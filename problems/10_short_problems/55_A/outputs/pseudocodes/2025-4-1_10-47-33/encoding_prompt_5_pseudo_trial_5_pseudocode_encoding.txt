**Purpose:** The primary goal of this code is to determine if there are any `True` values left in a boolean list after a series of updates, and based on that, print either "YES" or "NO".

**Pseudocode:**

```
START

// Step 1: Accept the size of the boolean list from user input
READ n as an integer

// Step 2: Create a boolean list of size n with all values initially set to True
INITIALIZE booleanList as a list of size n with all values as True

// Step 3: Initialize index variables
SET currentIndex to 0
SET increment to 1

// Step 4: Loop to update the boolean list
WHILE (increment is less than or equal to 500000)
    // Step 4a: If the value at the current index is True
    IF (booleanList[currentIndex] is True)
        // Step 4b: Set the value at the current index to False
        SET booleanList[currentIndex] to False
    END IF
    
    // Step 4c: Update the increment and move to the next index
    INCREASE increment by 1
    SET currentIndex to (currentIndex + increment) modulo n  // Wrap around if exceeds n
END WHILE

// Step 5: Check for any True values left in the boolean list
SET remainingTrueValues to a list of all elements in booleanList that are True

// Step 6: Determine the result based on the presence of True values
IF (length of remainingTrueValues is 0)
    PRINT "YES"  // No True values remain
ELSE
    PRINT "NO"   // There are still True values present
END IF

END
```

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The boolean list tracks active states (initially all True).
- The loop updates the list based on calculated indices, simulating the toggling of states.
- The final check assesses the state of the listâ€”if all values are toggled to False, it concludes with "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
