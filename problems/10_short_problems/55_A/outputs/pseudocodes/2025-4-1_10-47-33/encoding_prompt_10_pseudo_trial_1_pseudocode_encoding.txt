Hereâ€™s a clear and concise pseudocode version of the provided code, following the guided steps outlined:

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start Program**

2. **Input:**
   Set `n` to the integer value read from user input.

3. **Initialize Boolean Array:**
   Create a list `b` of size `n`, where each element is initialized to `True`.

4. **Initialize Counters:**
   Set `j` to 0 (represents the current index in the array).
   Set `i` to 1 (represents the current iteration number).

5. **Loop Until Limit:**
   While `i` is less than or equal to 500,000:
   - **Check Boolean Condition:**
     If `b[j]` is `True`:
        - Set `b[j]` to `False` (mark index `j` as processed).
   - Increment `i` by 1.
   - Update `j` to `(j + i) mod n` (calculate the next index in a circular manner).

6. **Filter True Values:**
   Create a list `x` composed of elements from `b` that are still `True`.

7. **Output Result:**
   - If the length of `x` is equal to 0:
       - Print "YES"
   - Else:
       - Print "NO"

8. **End Program**

---

**Assumptions Made:**
- The input value `n` is a positive integer.
- The array size `n` is large enough to support the operations performed on it during the loop.
- The boolean array `b` is properly initialized to handle entries for each index from 0 to `n-1`.

This pseudocode preserves the logical flow of the original code while enhancing readability and clarity through simplified expressions and structured language concepts.
