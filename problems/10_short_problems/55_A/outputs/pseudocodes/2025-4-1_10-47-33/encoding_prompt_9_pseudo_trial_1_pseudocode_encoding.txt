**Purpose:** This pseudocode determines whether there are any unmarked positions in a game using a sieve-like approach, based on a given number of positions.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Input the total number of positions:**
   - Read an integer value representing the number of positions, `totalPositions`.

2. **Initialize a list to track marked positions:**
   - Create a list called `markedPositions` with `totalPositions` elements, all set to `True`. This signifies that all positions are initially unmarked.

3. **Set initial index values:**
   - Let `currentIndex` start at 0. This will track the current position in the list.
   - Let `step` start at 1. This will define the increment in indices as we mark positions.

4. **Mark positions in a loop:**
   - Continue the process while `step` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the position at `currentIndex` in `markedPositions` is `True` (unmarked):
       - Change the value at `currentIndex` in `markedPositions` to `False` (mark it).
     - Increment `step` by 1.
     - Update `currentIndex` to the next position using the formula: `(currentIndex + step) % totalPositions`. This ensures that we loop back to the beginning if the end of the list is reached.

5. **Check for unmarked positions:**
   - Create a list called `unmarkedPositions` that contains all `True` values from `markedPositions`. This identifies any unmarked positions.

6. **Output results:**
   - If `unmarkedPositions` is empty (meaning all positions are marked):
     - Print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

**End of Pseudocode.**

By following this structure, the pseudocode effectively conveys the intended logic of the algorithm while remaining clear and accessible.
