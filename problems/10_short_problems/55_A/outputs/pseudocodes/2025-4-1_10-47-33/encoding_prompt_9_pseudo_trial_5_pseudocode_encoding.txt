**Purpose:**  
The goal of this algorithm is to determine whether there are any unmarked positions in a list after performing a specific marking process that simulates a counting game.

**Pseudocode:**  
1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Get an integer value `numberOfPositions` from the user input.
   - Create a list called `markedPositions` with `numberOfPositions` elements, all initially set to True.
   - Initialize a counter variable `currentIndex` to 0.
   - Set another counter variable `stepCount` to 1.

2. **Perform Marking Process:**
   - Set up a loop that repeats until the `stepCount` is greater than 500,000:
     1. Check if the current position in `markedPositions` at index `currentIndex` is True:
        - If it is True, mark this position as False (indicating it has been marked).
     2. Increment the `stepCount` by 1.
     3. Update the `currentIndex` to the next position based on the formula: `(currentIndex + stepCount) modulo numberOfPositions` to ensure it wraps around the list.

3. **Check for Unmarked Positions:**
   - Create a new list called `unmarkedPositions` and include all values from `markedPositions` that are still True.
   - If `unmarkedPositions` is empty (meaning no True values remain), output “YES” (indicating all positions were marked).
   - Otherwise, output “NO” (indicating there are still unmarked positions).

### Inputs and Outputs: 
- **Input:** An integer `numberOfPositions` indicating how many positions to mark.
- **Output:** A string “YES” if all positions are marked and “NO” if there are unmarked positions remaining.

### Final Check:  
Ensure that the pseudocode clearly represents the logic of the original algorithm, accurately captures the input and output requirements, and uses understandable language throughout.
