**Pseudocode:**

1. Begin the program.
2. Get an integer input from the user, representing the total number of elements, and store it as `totalElements`.
3. Create a list called `booleanList` with a size of `totalElements`, where all elements are initially set to true. This list will be used to track certain statuses.
4. Initialize a variable `currentIndex` to 0 and a variable `increment` to 1.
5. Start a loop that continues as long as `increment` is less than or equal to 500,000.
    a. Within the loop, check if the current position in `booleanList` (specified by `currentIndex`) is true.
        i. If it is true, set that position in `booleanList` to false.
    b. Increase the value of `increment` by 1.
    c. Update `currentIndex` by adding `increment` and taking the result modulo `totalElements`, to ensure the index wraps around if it exceeds the bounds of the list.
6. After exiting the loop, create a new list called `remainingTrueValues` that contains all elements from `booleanList` that are still true.
7. Check the length of `remainingTrueValues`.
    a. If the length is equal to 0, output "YES".
    b. Otherwise, output "NO".
8. End the program.
