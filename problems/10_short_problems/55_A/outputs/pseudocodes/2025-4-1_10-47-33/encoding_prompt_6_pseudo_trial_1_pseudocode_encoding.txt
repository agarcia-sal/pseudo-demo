Here's a clear and understandable pseudocode representation of the given code, which implements a logic for determining if certain conditions about an array are met.

```plaintext
START

// Read the integer input which represents the size of the list
READ sizeOfList

// Create a boolean list initialized to True with the specified size
CREATE booleanList of size sizeOfList, where each element is set to True

// Initialize loop counters
SET counter to 1
SET currentIndex to 0

// Loop until counter exceeds 500,000
WHILE counter is less than or equal to 500,000 DO
    // If the current index in the boolean list is True
    IF booleanList at currentIndex is True THEN
        // Mark the current index as False
        SET booleanList at currentIndex to False
    END IF

    // Increment the counter
    INCREMENT counter by 1

    // Update currentIndex based on the modulo of sizeOfList
    SET currentIndex to (currentIndex + counter) MOD sizeOfList
END WHILE

// Create a list of all True values from the boolean list
CREATE list of remainingTrueValues FROM booleanList where each value is True

// Check if any True values remain
IF length of remainingTrueValues is equal to 0 THEN
    // If no True values left, print "YES"
    PRINT "YES"
ELSE
    // If there are True values left, print "NO"
    PRINT "NO"
END IF

END
```

### Summary of Logic:
- First, the program takes an integer input for the size of a list.
- It initializes a boolean list where all entries are set to True.
- It enters a loop which continues until a counter reaches 500,000. 
- Within this loop, it checks if the current index in the boolean list is True, marking it as False if it is.
- The current index is updated in a way that wraps around the size of the list using modulo operation.
- After the loop, it checks how many True values remain in the boolean list.
- It then prints "YES" if no True values remain and "NO" if there are remaining True values. 

This representation ensures clarity and emphasizes the logical structure over specific coding syntax.
