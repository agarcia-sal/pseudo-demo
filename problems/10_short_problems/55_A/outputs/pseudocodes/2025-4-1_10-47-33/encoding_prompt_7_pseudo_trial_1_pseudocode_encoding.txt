Here is the high-level pseudocode that accurately captures the logic and operations of the provided code:

```
FUNCTION checkArrayStatus(size)
    INITIALIZE an array 'isActive' of boolean values with 'size' elements, all set to True
    SET index to 0
    SET iteration to 1

    WHILE iteration is less than or equal to 500000 DO
        IF isActive[index] is True THEN
            SET isActive[index] to False
        END IF

        INCREASE iteration by 1
        UPDATE index to (index + iteration) MOD size
    END WHILE

    INITIALIZE an array 'activeElements' to store elements of isActive that are still True
    
    FOR each element 'element' in isActive DO
        IF element is True THEN
            ADD element to activeElements
        END IF
    END FOR

    IF the length of activeElements is equal to 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Pseudocode Breakdown:
1. **Input Parameters:** 
   - The function takes one parameter, `size`, which represents the number of elements in the array.

2. **Initialization:**
   - An array `isActive` is initialized with a size determined by the input, filled with `True` values, indicating that all elements are initially "active".

3. **Loop Through Iterations:**
   - A loop runs a thousand iterations (up to 500000), where for each iteration:
     - If the current index in the array points to an active element, it is marked as inactive (set to `False`).
     - The index is updated based on the current iteration number wrapped around the size of the array.

4. **Identifying Active Elements:**
   - After completing the loop, a new array `activeElements` is constructed, containing only the active (still `True`) elements from the `isActive` array.

5. **Final Check:**
   - The function checks if `activeElements` is empty. If it is empty, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

This pseudocode maintains clarity and comprehensively outlines the program's logic without delving into programming-specific syntax.
