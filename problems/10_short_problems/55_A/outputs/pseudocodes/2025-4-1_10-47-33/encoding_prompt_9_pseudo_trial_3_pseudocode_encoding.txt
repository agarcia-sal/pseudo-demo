**Purpose:**  
The goal of this program is to determine whether there are any remaining `True` values in a list after processing elements according to a specific rule. It evaluates a sequence of boolean values based on a defined algorithm, and outputs "YES" if all values are changed to `False`, and "NO" otherwise.

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start**
  
2. **Receive Input:**
   - Read an integer `n` from the user, which determines the size of a list.
  
3. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a boolean list named `statusList` with `n` elements, all initialized to `True`.

4. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Set a variable `currentIndex` to 0.
   - Set a variable `increment` to 1.

5. **Process List:**
   - Set up a loop that continues while `increment` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - Check if the current index in `statusList` is `True`:
       - If it is `True`, change that element in `statusList` to `False`.
     - Increase `increment` by 1.
     - Update the `currentIndex` using the formula: 
       - `currentIndex` = (currentIndex + increment) mod n (to ensure it wraps around the list size).

6. **Check Remaining Values:**
   - Create a new list called `remainingTrue` that contains all the `True` values from `statusList`.

7. **Generate Output:**
   - If `remainingTrue` is empty (i.e., all values in the list are `False`):
     - Print "YES"
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO"

8. **End**
