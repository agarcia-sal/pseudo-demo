**Pseudocode: Check Values in a List**

1. Begin the program
2. Read an integer value `n` from user input
3. Create a list `isActive` of length `n`, where all elements are initially set to `True`
4. Initialize a variable `currentIndex` to 0
5. Initialize a variable `increment` to 1
6. While `increment` is less than or equal to 500000, do the following:
   1. If the element at `currentIndex` in the list `isActive` is `True`, then:
      - Set the element at `currentIndex` in the list `isActive` to `False`
   2. Increment `increment` by 1
   3. Update `currentIndex` to be the sum of `currentIndex` and `increment`, then find the remainder when divided by `n`
7. Create a list `activeElements` that contains only the elements from `isActive` that are still `True`
8. If the length of `activeElements` is equal to 0:
   - Output "YES"
9. Otherwise:
   - Output "NO"
10. End the program

**Input Requirements:**
- The program accepts a single integer input `n`.

**Output Requirements:**
- The program outputs "YES" if there are no `True` values left in the list, otherwise it outputs "NO".
