Here is a pseudocode representation of the provided code:

```
BEGIN

    // Read an integer input to determine the size of the list
    SET numberOfElements TO integer(input())

    // Initialize a list to track boolean values (True/False) for each position
    CREATE list of booleans isActive WITH size numberOfElements, initialized to True

    // Initialize position variables for iterating
    SET index TO 0
    SET step TO 1

    // Loop until the step variable exceeds 500,000
    WHILE (step <= 500000) DO
        // Check if the current position in the list is marked as active
        IF (isActive[index] is True) THEN
            // Mark the current position as inactive
            SET isActive[index] TO False
        END IF

        // Increment the step variable
        INCREMENT step BY 1

        // Update the index based on the step, wrapping around using modulo
        SET index TO (index + step) MOD numberOfElements
    END WHILE

    // Filter to create a list of active positions (where value is True)
    CREATE list of activePositions FROM isActive WHERE value is True

    // Check if there are no active positions left
    IF (length of activePositions is 0) THEN
        OUTPUT 'YES' // All positions are inactive
    ELSE
        OUTPUT 'NO'  // There are still active (True) positions
    END IF

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:

- The pseudocode starts with a clear beginning and end, describing the overall flow of the algorithm.
- Each operation is expressed simply, with meaningful variable names to indicate their purpose.
- Control structures such as loops and conditionals are described in straightforward language to make it easy to follow.
- The final output is based on the length of a filtered list, clearly indicating the condition that leads to the result.
