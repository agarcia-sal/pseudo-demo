**Purpose:**  
The algorithm determines if all elements in a list can be marked as false based on a specific iterative marking process. If any elements remain true, it outputs "NO"; otherwise, it outputs "YES".

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Read Input:**
   - Get an integer value `n` which represents the number of elements.

2. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a list called `marked` with `n` elements, and set all elements to `True`. This list will track whether each position is still marked.

3. **Initialize Counters:**
   - Set `current_index` to 0. This will represent the position currently being processed.
   - Set `step_size` to 1. This will be the increment for which positions to mark based on an increasing step.

4. **Iterative Marking:**
   - While `step_size` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the current position `current_index` in the `marked` list is `True`:
       - Change the value at `current_index` in the `marked` list to `False`, marking it.
     - Increment the `step_size` by 1.
     - Calculate the next position to check using the formula: `current_index = (current_index + step_size) modulo n`.

5. **Check Marks:**
   - Create a new list called `remaining_true` containing only the elements from `marked` that are still `True`.

6. **Output Result:**
   - If the length of `remaining_true` is 0 (indicating all were marked), print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

**Summary of Logic Flow:**
- The algorithm uses an iterative marking process, starting with all elements marked as true, and progressively marks elements as false based on computed positions. After the iterations, it checks if any elements remain true, outputting the respective result.
