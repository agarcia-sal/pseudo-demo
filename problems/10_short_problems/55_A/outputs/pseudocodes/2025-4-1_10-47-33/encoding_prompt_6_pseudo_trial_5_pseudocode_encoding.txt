Here's a clear and understandable pseudocode representation of the provided algorithm:

```
START

// Read the total number of elements
SET totalElements TO user input as an integer

// Initialize a list to track status of each element, all set to True initially
DEFINE statusList AS a list of True with size totalElements

SET currentIndex TO 0
SET iterationCounter TO 1

// Loop until the iteration counter exceeds 500000
WHILE iterationCounter IS LESS THAN or EQUAL TO 500000 DO
    // If the current position in the status list is True, change it to False
    IF statusList[currentIndex] IS True THEN
        statusList[currentIndex] SET to False
    END IF

    // Increment the iteration counter
    INCREMENT iterationCounter BY 1
    
    // Update the index in the status list using the current iteration
    SET currentIndex TO (currentIndex + iterationCounter) MOD totalElements
END WHILE

// Create a list of all positions that are still True
DEFINE remainingTrueStatus AS a new list consisting of elements in statusList that are True

// Check if there are no elements remaining that are True
IF length of remainingTrueStatus IS EQUAL TO 0 THEN
    PRINT 'YES' // Indicating all elements have been marked
ELSE
    PRINT 'NO' // Indicating some elements are still marked true
END IF

END
```

### Explanation of the Pseudocode:
1. The algorithm starts by capturing the number of elements from the user input.
2. It initializes a list where each index represents an initial state (True).
3. A while loop iterates up to 500,000 times, modifying the list based on specific conditions.
4. Within the loop, if a position is still True, it is marked as False.
5. After the loop ends, it checks if any True values remain and prints "YES" if none are left or "NO" if some are still True.
