**Pseudocode:**

1. **Initialize Input:**
   - Read an integer value from the user, representing the number of elements, and store it in a variable called `numberOfElements`.

2. **Create a Boolean List:**
   - Create a list called `isActive` with `numberOfElements` entries, all initialized to `True`. This list will track which elements are still active.

3. **Set Initial Indices:**
   - Initialize two variables:
     - `currentIndex` to 0 (to represent the current position in `isActive`).
     - `stepSize` to 1 (to represent the step size for the current round of elimination).

4. **Start Elimination Process:**
   - While `stepSize` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - If the entry in `isActive` at `currentIndex` is `True`:
       - Set the entry at `currentIndex` to `False` (indicating that this position has been eliminated).
     - Increment `stepSize` by 1.
     - Update `currentIndex` to the new position using the formula: `(currentIndex + stepSize) % numberOfElements` (this ensures that the index wraps around to the start if it exceeds the total number of elements).

5. **Check Remaining Active Entries:**
   - Create a new list called `remainingActive` that includes all entries in `isActive` that are still `True` (indicating positions that were not eliminated).

6. **Determine and Print Final Result:**
   - If the length of `remainingActive` is 0 (meaning all positions have been eliminated):
     - Print "YES" (indicating that no active positions remain).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating that there are still some active positions).
