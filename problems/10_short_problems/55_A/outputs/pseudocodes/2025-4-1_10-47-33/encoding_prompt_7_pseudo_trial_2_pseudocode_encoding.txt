Sure! Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode representation of the provided code, which describes its logic and operations clearly.

```
FUNCTION checkStatusOfElements(n)
    INITIALIZE array 'b' of size n with all values set to True
    SET index 'j' to 0
    SET counter 'i' to 1
    
    WHILE counter 'i' is less than or equal to 500000 DO
        IF element at index 'j' in array 'b' is True THEN
            SET element at index 'j' in array 'b' to False
        END IF
        INCREMENT counter 'i' by 1
        UPDATE index 'j' to (index 'j' + counter 'i') modulo n
    END WHILE
    
    CREATE a new array 'x' containing all True values from array 'b'
    
    IF length of array 'x' is 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'  // Indicates that all elements in 'b' have been set to False
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'   // Indicates that there are still True elements in 'b'
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Context:
- **Input**: The function takes an integer `n` which is the size of the array `b`.
- **Operations**: The function initializes an array `b` with `n` elements set to True. It then iteratively updates the array based on a looping mechanism involving two indices, marking certain elements as False.
- **Output**: It outputs "YES" if all elements have been marked as False, and "NO" otherwise.

This pseudocode simplifies the flow of the original implementation while maintaining clarity and coherence.
