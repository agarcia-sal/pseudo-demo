Here is the pseudocode for the provided code, following the guided steps:

```
1. Start
2. Define variable n as an integer. // Assume n is a non-negative integer input by the user.
3. Create a list b of size n and initialize all elements to True.
4. Initialize variable j to 0.
5. Initialize variable i to 1.

6. While i is less than or equal to 500,000 do:
    a. If b[j] is True then:
        i. Set b[j] to False. // Mark the current position as False.
    b. Increment i by 1.
    c. Update j to (j + i) modulo n. // Update j to stay within the bounds of the list.

7. Create a new list x containing all elements from b that are still True.
8. If the length of x is equal to 0 then:
    a. Print "YES".
9. Otherwise:
    a. Print "NO".
10. End
```

### Key Components:
- **Variables**: n (input size), b (list), j (index), i (counter).
- **Loop**: Executes while i is within a specified range (1 to 500,000).
- **Conditional Statements**: Checks if an element in the list is True or False.

### Assumptions:
- The input n is a non-negative integer.
- The list b is initialized to hold Boolean values.
- Variable states are correctly managed within the bounds of the list size.

This pseudocode breaks down the original code into simpler, structured steps while maintaining clarity and readability.
