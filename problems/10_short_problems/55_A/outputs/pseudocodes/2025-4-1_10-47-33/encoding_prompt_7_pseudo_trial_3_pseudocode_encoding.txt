Here's the high-level pseudocode for the provided code, capturing its logic and operations:

```
FUNCTION checkAllNumbersRemoved(n)
    INITIALIZE list 'isRemoved' with 'n' elements, all set to True
    INITIALIZE index 'currentIndex' to 0
    INITIALIZE step 'currentStep' to 1
    
    WHILE currentStep is less than or equal to 500000 DO
        IF isRemoved[currentIndex] is True THEN
            Mark isRemoved[currentIndex] as False
        END IF
        
        Increment currentStep by 1
        Update currentIndex to (currentIndex + currentStep) MOD n
    END WHILE
    
    INITIALIZE list 'remaining' containing elements from isRemoved that are still True
    
    IF length of remaining is 0 THEN
        PRINT 'YES'
    ELSE
        PRINT 'NO'
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Purpose:** This function checks a list of numbers to determine if any numbers remain 'True' (indicating they were not marked as 'removed') after processing up to a maximum of 500,000 steps.
   
2. **Variables:**
   - `n`: Represents the total number of elements (input size).
   - `isRemoved`: A boolean list initialized to track whether each index has been "removed."
   - `currentIndex`: Tracks the current position in the list based on the calculations.
   - `currentStep`: Increases with each iteration, representing the step size for jumping through indexes.

3. **Control Flow:**
   - A while loop continues processing while `currentStep` is less than or equal to 500,000.
   - Inside the loop, if the current index is still marked as True, it changes it to False (marking it as removed).
   - The `currentIndex` is updated based on the sum of the `currentIndex` and `currentStep` to check new elements.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing, it checks if there are any elements still marked as True. If none are left, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.
   
5. **Complexity Context:** The loop runs at most 500,000 times, managing the updates to the boolean list and examining its contents at the end. This could be useful for applications needing to model iterative processes in numerical simulations or similar scenarios.
