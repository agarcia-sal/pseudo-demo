Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that captures the logic of the original code:

```
1. Start the program

2. Get an integer input called max_index
3. Create a list called boolean_list initialized with True values of size max_index

4. Initialize an index variable called current_index to 0
5. Initialize a step variable called current_step to 1

6. While current_step is less than or equal to 500000:
    a. If the value at boolean_list[current_index] is True:
        i. Set boolean_list[current_index] to False  // Mark this index as processed
    b. Increment current_step by 1
    c. Update current_index as (current_index + current_step) % max_index  // Move to the next index using modulo to wrap around

7. Create a new list called remaining_true_indices containing all values in boolean_list that are still True

8. If the size of remaining_true_indices is zero:
    a. Output 'YES'  // All indices have been marked
9. Else:
    a. Output 'NO'  // Some indices are still unmarked

10. End the program
```
