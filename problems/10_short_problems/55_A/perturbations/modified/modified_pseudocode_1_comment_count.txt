**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start**: Begin the program.

2. 
   - Prompt the user for a number and store it as `input_number`.
   - Convert `input_number` to an integer and store it in the variable `size`.

3. 
   - Create a list called `boolean_list` with `size` elements, all set to `True`.

4. 
   - Set `current_index` to 0.
   - Set `step_count` to 1.

5. 
   - While `step_count` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - **Check Boolean Value**:
       - If `boolean_list[current_index]` is `True`, then:
         - Set `boolean_list[current_index]` to `False`.
     - Increment `step_count` by 1.
     - Update `current_index` as follows:
       - Calculate the new `current_index` by adding `step_count` to it and taking the remainder when divided by `size` .

6. 
   - Create a list called `remaining_true` that includes all values from `boolean_list` that are still `True`.

7. 
   - If the length of `remaining_true` is 0:
     - Print "YES" 
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" 

8. **End**: Finish the program.
