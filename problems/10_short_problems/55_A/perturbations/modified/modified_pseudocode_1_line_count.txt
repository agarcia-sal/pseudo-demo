**Purpose Summary**: This code checks if all elements in a boolean list can be marked as 'False' based on a specific pattern of updates, ultimately determining whether any elements remain 'True'. If all have been marked 'False', it outputs 'YES'; if any remain 'True', it outputs 'NO'.

**Pseudocode**:

1. **Start**: Begin the program.

2. **Read Input**:
   - Prompt the user for a number and store it as `input_number`.
   - Convert `input_number` to an integer and store it in the variable `size`.

3. **Initialize Boolean List**:
   - Create a list called `boolean_list` with `size` elements, all set to `True`.

4. **Initialize Index Variables**:
   - Set `current_index` to 0 (it tracks the position in the list).
   - Set `step_count` to 1 (it determines how many steps to skip).

5. **Loop**:
   - While `step_count` is less than or equal to 500,000:
     - **Check Boolean Value**:
       - If `boolean_list[current_index]` is `True`, then:
         - Set `boolean_list[current_index]` to `False`.
     - Increment `step_count` by 1.
     - Update `current_index` as follows:
       - Calculate the new `current_index` by adding `step_count` to it and taking the remainder when divided by `size` (to stay within bounds of the list).

6. **Filter Remaining True Values**:
   - Create a list called `remaining_true` that includes all values from `boolean_list` that are still `True`.

7. **Check Remaining Elements**:
   - If the length of `remaining_true` is 0:
     - Print "YES" (indicating that all were marked False).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print "NO" (indicating that some remain True).

8. **End**: Finish the program.

**Comments for Clarity**:
- The boolean list acts as a marker for elements, where `True` signifies an element has not yet been marked.
- The process of incrementing the index ensures that we systematically mark positions based on a calculated step count, creating a skipping pattern.
- The final check asserts whether any elements remain unmarked, guiding the output response.

This pseudocode is designed to be straightforward, explaining the logic without specific programming syntax, making it accessible for readers unfamiliar with coding.
