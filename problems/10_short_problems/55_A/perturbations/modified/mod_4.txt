Hereâ€™s the pseudocode that captures the logic of the original code:

```
1. Start the program

2. Get an integer input called num
3. Create a list called boolean_list initialized with True values of size num

4. Initialize an index variable called curr to 0
5. Initialize a step variable called step to 1

6. While step is less than or equal to 500000:
    a. If the value at boolean_list[curr] is True:
        i. Set boolean_list[curr] to False  // Mark this index as processed
    b. Increment step by 1
    c. Update curr as (curr + step) % num  // Move to the next index using modulo to wrap around

7. Create a new list called rem containing all values in boolean_list that are still True

8. If the size of rem is zero:
    a. Output 'YES'  // All indices have been marked
9. Else:
    a. Output 'NO'  // Some indices are still unmarked

10. End the program
```

### Summary of Logic:
- The program initializes a list of boolean values representing indices.
- It processes each index based on steps up to 500,000, marking certain indices as False.
- Finally, it checks whether any indices remain True and outputs a message based on that check.
