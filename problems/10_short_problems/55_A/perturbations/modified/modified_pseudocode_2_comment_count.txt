**Pseudocode**:

```
1. Start
2. Read an integer 'n' from user input
3. Initialize a list 'positions' of size 'n' with all elements set to True
4. Set a variable 'currentIndex' to 0
5. Set a variable 'stepSize' to 1

6. While 'stepSize' is less than or equal to 500000:
    a. If positions[currentIndex] is True:
        i. Mark positions[currentIndex] as False
    b. Increase 'stepSize' by 1
    c. Update 'currentIndex' to (currentIndex + stepSize) modulo 'n'

7. Create a new list 'remainingTruePositions' containing all elements from 'positions' that are still True

8. If remainingTruePositions is empty:
    a. Print "YES" 
9. Else:
    a. Print "NO" 
10. End
```
