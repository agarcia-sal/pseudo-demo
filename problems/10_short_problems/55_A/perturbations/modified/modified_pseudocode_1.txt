**Purpose:** The primary goal of the code is to determine whether there are any `True` values left in a list after performing a series of operations. If no `True` values remain, the program outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.

---

**Pseudocode:**

1. **Start the Program**
  
2. **Read Input:**
   - Read an integer value `n`, which represents the size of the list.

3. **Initialize List:**
   - Create a list called `statusList` of size `n`, with all values set to `True` (indicating they are active).

4. **Initialize Counters:**
   - Set initial values for two counters: 
     - `currentIndex` is set to 0 (to track the current position in the list).
     - `stepCount` is set to 1 (to represent the step increment).

5. **Begin Loop:**
   - While `stepCount` is less than or equal to 500000:
     - Check if the value at `currentIndex` in `statusList` is `True`:
       - If it is `True`, change this value in `statusList` to `False` (indicating it is now inactive).
     - Increment `stepCount` by 1.
     - Move to the next index position:
       - Update `currentIndex` to be the result of adding `stepCount` to `currentIndex` and taking the remainder when divided by `n` (to wrap around the list).

6. **Check Active Items:**
   - Create a new list called `activeItems`, which contains all values from `statusList` that are still `True`.

7. **Determine Output:**
   - If the length of `activeItems` is 0 (meaning there are no active items left):
     - Print 'YES' (indicating all items are inactive).
   - Otherwise:
     - Print 'NO' (indicating some items are still active).

8. **End the Program**

**Comments for Clarity:**
- The `statusList` is used to track which items remain true or active.
- The loop operates by marking certain indices in the list as inactive based on the incremental update of `stepCount`.
- The wrapping around of index using modulus ensures continuous cycling through the list, preventing out-of-bounds errors.
