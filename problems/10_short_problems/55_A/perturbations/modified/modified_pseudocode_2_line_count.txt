**Purpose**: The goal of this algorithm is to determine whether all positions in a given list become marked as 'False' after a series of operations, starting with all positions marked as 'True' and following a specific pattern.

**Pseudocode**:

```
1. Start
2. Read an integer 'n' from user input
3. Initialize a list 'positions' of size 'n' with all elements set to True
4. Set a variable 'currentIndex' to 0
5. Set a variable 'stepSize' to 1

6. While 'stepSize' is less than or equal to 500000:
    a. If positions[currentIndex] is True:
        i. Mark positions[currentIndex] as False
    b. Increase 'stepSize' by 1
    c. Update 'currentIndex' to (currentIndex + stepSize) modulo 'n'

7. Create a new list 'remainingTruePositions' containing all elements from 'positions' that are still True

8. If remainingTruePositions is empty:
    a. Print "YES" (indicating that all positions are False)
9. Else:
    a. Print "NO" (indicating that there are still True positions)
10. End
```

### Comments for Clarity:
- The main logic uses a loop to traverse through positions, marking certain entries as False based on the increased step size.
- The modulo operation ensures that the index wraps around when it reaches the end of the list.
- After processing, the program checks if any positions remain True and outputs the result accordingly.
